Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," troubleshooting ad-2500 and ad-2600 no picture scrolling b/w . 
 repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title . 
 does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ? 
 or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ? 
 before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first . 
 no picture : 
 hopefully you still have the remote control . 
 if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it . 
 using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . 
 the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive . 
 if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd . 
 if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car ! 
 picture scrolling in b/w : 
 you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard . 
 press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . 
 the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc . 
 by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .

 i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips . 
 i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal . 
i/p button  im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! 
 the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place . 
dvd player  but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! 
dvd player  it practically plays almost everything you give it . 
player  i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor . 
price  for the price it is a well spent investment ! 
 i would recommend buying one . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," incredibe price / performance . 
 i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 . 
dvd player  this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . 
look ,panel button layout  it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . 
forward , rewind  its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 
video format  it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well . 
price  and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? 
 i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom . 
 strengths are well listed by other reviewers . 
play , dvd-r  what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . 
dvd-r  it sure does ! 
dvd-r  that 's a rare and valuable feature . 
 i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) ! 
audio output  another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . 
 saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable . 
forward  at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! 
 i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo . 
remote control , mp3 filename  weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . 
 if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model . 
finish  update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it ! 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," doesnt play new disney movies . 
play , disney movie  many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player . 
 i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," poor quality - problem with dual-layer dvd 's . 
dual-layer dvd  player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 . 
 for the money , get a better quality player . 
player , look  player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . 
player  i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse . 
apex  will never purchase apex again . 
customer service , technical support  customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them . 
 pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas ! 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," has destroyed several of my dvds and cds . 
case  for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . 
dvd , read , play  then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . 
cd  new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays . 
player  i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . 
 there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk ! 
player  this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . 
 i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read . 
 i just got screwed out of fifty bucks . 
support  apex does n't answer the phone . 
   sigh . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," their customer service sucks . 
customer service  no way to contact their customer service . 
quality  very bad quality . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," great value . 
player  i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites . 
player  i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him . 
 now i need to buy myself another one ! 
player  have used it frequently and have had no problems . 
 i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others . 
player  i liked this one enough to buy another . 
apex  my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money . 
picture quality  great quality picture and features . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," 2 out of three ai n't good . 
 thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats . 
 i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now . 
player  they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them . 
 i am back to using # 1 . 
player  nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," buy a better known brand name . 
player  this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . 
door  the door would not close . 
customer service  i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept . 
 i am still trying to resolve it four months later . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," piece of crap .. . 
look , feature  it looks great - and is loaded with features . 
player  unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type . 
player  have had problems since the first day 
play , dvd  - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it . 
 save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," i 've had no problems . 
apex  the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 
player  i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it . 
heat  it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation . 
smell  it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time . 
freezing  the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . "" 
 this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue . 
 the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend . 
player  ( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . ) 
jpeg slideshow  the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 
remote  the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . 
button  i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . 
 while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way . 
zoom mode  i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . 
zoom  the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . 
onscreen display  having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying . 
 i have not used the progressive scan feature . 
 this model has come down in price since i purchased mine . 
 while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase . 
 any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support . 
player  while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," do not buy this piece of junk . 
 i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires . 
picture , player  it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do . 
 i can only hear the sound . 
 i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help . 
 i think you get what you pay for stands true . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," nice paperweight . 
player  i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . 
customer service  i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 
 as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning . 
 do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," worst piece of electronics i ever bought . 
 if i could give this a negative rating , i would . 
 i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems . 
play , disc  wo n't play a lot of discs . 
 i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap ! 
play  some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today . 
play  it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten . 
tech support  tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent . 
 amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds ! 
 there should have been a recall on this product . 
 fair warning - do not buy . 
 i repeat - do n't wast your money . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," do n't buy ! 
player  i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
dvd player  it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . 
 one stopped working in february and the other in march . 
 amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return . 
 i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," we had problems . 
dvd player  the dvd player does not work properly . 
player  the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . 
player  this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . 
customer support  after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," ok if you have a 2nd dvd player . 
 i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now . 
player  nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . 
play , dvd  unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . 
 i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode . 
dvd  on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd . 
 luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't . 
player  unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," another person who had problem with picture after one use . 
 i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband . 
work  we tried it out christmas night and it worked great . 
jpeg  even viewed cds full of jpgs . 
 we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) . 
picture , player  but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture . 
 we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks . 
 though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help . 
 they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck . 
apex  i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone . 
 do not buy this player . 
player  who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player ! 
remote  we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work "" apex "" dvd players and none worked . 
 called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) . 
 if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you ! 
dvd , play  ( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," poor customer service . 
remote  i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective . 
 it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced . 
customer service  the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line . 
apex  i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," a piece of junk . 
door  door broke after a month . 
unit  unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 
player  3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . 
 forget about it . 
 it 's money down the drain . 
 get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," to quote bart : "" craptacular "" . 
player  well , it was nice while it lasted . 
player  after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds . 
player  as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," poor quality . 
player  only used for 3 month before it 's down ! 
 i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it ! 
picture  it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . 
color  the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . 
 maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," returned after failing to play dvds . 
 i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon . 
 as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement . 
unit  the entire unit was poorly crafted . 
screw tip  there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . 
dvd , play  after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it . 
 most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition . 
player  the dvd player just would't recognize them . 
no disc  it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc . 
 i ended up sending the unit back to amazon . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," apex ad2600 . 
format ,progressive scan  this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature . 
 now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos . 
 but for $ 49.99 go get one ! 
 features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," customer service nonexistant . 
player  i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! 
 i have been trying for over a week to contact apex . 
customer service  they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy . 
 all i am looking for is a rebate form ! 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," what a buy .. . 
 i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it . 
 i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck . 
feature  because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's . 
 however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) . 
play , different file  the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's . 
play , mpeg  it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . 
mpeg  i find this to be a great feature . 
play  i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great . 
feature  for the money apex machines have good features . 
 you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units . 
design  it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice . 
player  i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," avoid apex dvd players - even if they 're free ! 
 i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax . 
player  now i know why - they are pieces of junk . 
no disc , screen  less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . "" 
 this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last . 
 my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it . 
service  same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . 
 pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," best player for the buck . 
format  i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper . 
aff  the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . 
design  loved the slim design . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," black and white only after 1 month of use . 
color signal  this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . 
customer service  apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," most bang for the buck. i recieved my 2600 4 days ago and feel that this may be the best $ 50 i have ever spent . 
 it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up . 
audio  audio is excellent . 
 well worth the money . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," for the price , an excellent buy . 
 after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected . 
 ( good going , amazon ). 
player , format  i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer . 
 so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's . 
 i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks . 
 i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit . 
 the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray . 
 so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit . 
 i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point . 
player  but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it . 
 bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," excellent second dvd , or first dvd for hdtv ready tv. 
 wow ! 
player  simple to use and hook up . 
 comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs . 
progressive scan  the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used . 
 i also own an "" apex ad 1201 "" dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago . 
 one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent . 
 and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does . 
 friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased . 
 i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name . 
 consider it for a future gift too !

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," apex ad2600 known capadabilty problem . 
play , dvd , no disc  i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) . 
 they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem . 
 i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," value for money ! 
 i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player . 
dvd player  well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! 
media  it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! 
user interface  i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds . 
 it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player . 
player  i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player . 
 what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ? 
 i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit ! 
 hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days . 
look  and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! 
remote control  one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . 
shipping  finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," poor quality dvd player . 
player  i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad . 
player  the first one would n't work from the start . 
player  the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! 
 amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com ! 
 i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one . 
on-line support  i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy . 
 i will never buy another apex digital product !

dvd , picture , play  but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments . 
 usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it . 
 annoying .

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," no picture and / or no sound , try i/p button on the remote . 
product  we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working . 
 it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs . 
picture , sound  there was neither picture nor sound . 
 connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture . 
 the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help . 
 i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control . 
 it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode . 
 obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode . 
product  we are overall pleased with product . 
manual  i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," people with video issue 's . 
 i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan . 
 another stupid move . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," buyer beware . 
 i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 . 
picture  it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . ) 
support  i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal . 
 i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one ! 
support  neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . ) 
 i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info . 
 let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) : 
 "" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," barely worked . 
dvd , read , no disc  it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen . 
 i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back . 
 amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ). 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," has problems reading some dvds. 
 good : 
progressive scan player  progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) . 
dvd  seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) . 
read , svcd , vbr mp3 cd  also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) . 
output  output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv . 
 bad : 
disc , recognize  i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) . 
no disc  it would just spin up and stop , and display "" no disc "" . 
remote  my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units . 
 for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button . 
button  you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll . 
s-video  also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ). 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," pretty good . 
 ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know . 
player  i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box . 
auto fit  i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal . 
 lot 's of other features that i need to find out about . 
look  looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors . 
 things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off ! 
remote  and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !

"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," great dvd player . 
 i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself . 
format  when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with . 
use , size  easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot . 
 very happy !

 i wish i could give negative stars ! 
 i bought this dvd player in november . 
 i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today . 
 i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one . 
 what a mistake ! 
player  after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty . 
 i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing . 
no disc  i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc . 
 i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens . 
customer service  i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable . 
customer service  i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered . 
 i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy . 
 that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make . 
 do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money ! 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," keep shopping , do n't stop here . 
 i bought this as a gift for my sister . 
player  it has never worked .

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," worst customer service on record . 
player  purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it . 
on/off button  the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button . 
 the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever . 
 i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again . 
 i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem . 
customer service  they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply . 
customer service  i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response . 
 i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you . 
 once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message . 
 still no response . 
 i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .

 i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife . 
player  3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze . 
player  now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk . 
customer service  have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid . 
customer service  have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," problems . 
 i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price . 
 however , i should have followed my instincts : 
 you get what you pay for . 
dvd  one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing . 
dvd  some dvd 's i rented would not play . 
 now , i suddenly have no picture . 
 i will say this . 
player  when the player was working it was great ,but . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," the second apex - at least it 's prettier than the last . 
 the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated . 
 the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed : 
 i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks . 
 i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ). 
 back to the 2600 : 
 1 . 
smell  it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive . 
 2 . 
look  without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen . 
 3 . 
picture quality  excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players . 
 4 . 
remote  remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s . 
 anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product . 
 i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one : 
 with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," does not play dvds with extra features .. . 
dvd  first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed . 
player  unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition . 
design  as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine . 
dvd  what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds . 
read  for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the carribean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it . 
read , dvd  at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well . 
player  this player seems to work fine with everything else . 
 so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them . 
player  because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," apex you can trust . 
 i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years . 
 had no problem with it . 
 now , i thought it 's time to upgrade . 
 so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon . 
run , dvd  it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented . 
 i have a dvd burner . 
run , dvd media #apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) . 
dvd player  i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price . 
 some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks ! 
apex  most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy . 
 if you are skeptical about trying apex . 
 take my words and give it a try . 
 hopefully you wo n't regret . 
 goodluck ! 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," a great discovery ! 
 i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years ! 
player  this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve . 
sound ,picture clarity  i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! 
case  so much packed in a small case and very affordable !

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," quirky ? 
 i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house . 
size  it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up . 
usage  basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used . 
player  so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine . 
picture  the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good . 
 again , though , it has only been used sparingly . 
read , disc  the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie "" extras "" on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that . 
 it 's not a big deal for me . 
 i simply watched the extra features on another player . 
 had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem . 
 as it is , i 'm keeping the machine . 
player  it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something . 
 but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking . 
player  i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation . 
player  there are a lot of things i like about it . 
 be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .

remote  the remote is a little hard to understand . 
jpeg picture  my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 "" screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 "" monitor . 
dvd  so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read . 
 prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !

lip-sync  there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) . 
video  but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working . 
amazon  amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping . 
 perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy "" off "" brands .

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," read the manual ! ! 
 i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .

 ( my orignal review is below : ) 
feature  great feature list , poor reliability .

 so far we have only hooked up one of them . 
unit , format  the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is "" two thumbs up "" ! 
 ( i guess only time will tell ? ) 
remote  p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," does n't play my alias season 1 dvds . 
player  what the hell is wrong with this thing . 
 i bought this thing because it plays everything . 
 this is the third apex dvd i bought . 
 the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision . 
 the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties . 
 but heck it plays my alias dvds . 
 what the heck is up with the 2600 . 
 it suppose to play everything . 
 wrong ! 
 by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet . 
 i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay . 
 you should too . 
play , dvd  forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," disappointing - get what you pay for . 
look  the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling . 
dvd  i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds . 
 after "" loading "" for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated "" no disk "" . 
video  after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available . 
disk  only one disk played through to completion successfully . 
 at $ 49 . 
 i guess you get what you pay for . 
 i 'd recommend against this unit . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," this dvd player ruined christmas - twice ! 
 i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts . 
player , motor , disc  when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door . 
 strike 1 .
player  when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn "" t work either ! 
apex  imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex . 
power supply  the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on . 
 do not recommend . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," let the countdown begin apex . 
 what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies . 
 in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 . 
 and have returned both . 
ad-1600 , ad-1220  the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up . 
 my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 . 
 i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them . 
 it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season . 
amazon  amazon is awaesome ! 
 they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back . 
 what more could you ask for . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," price vs performance . 
dvd player  for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player . 
door  the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile . 
format  it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice . 
dvd  and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play . 
 recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," my first dvd player and i 'm well satisfied ! 
 i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player . 
 i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly . 
feature  i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there . 
size  the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand . 
player  i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy . 
 i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine . 
 even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," when it works , it 's great , when it does n't it 's frustrating . 
 bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 . 
 that was a mistake . 
dvd  we tried the "" finding nemo "" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason . 
 cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck . 
 i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the "" finding nemo "" dvd works fine . 
 i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for . 
player  i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good . 
player  only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," i will give it one more try ! 
 i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night . 
 i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc . 
player , no disc  the player kept displaying "" no disc "" , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ #   ! 
 it worked . 
 i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc . 
 the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another . 
 the other company is currently "" out of stock "" so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today . 
 hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine . 
 if not i will avoid apex products in the future . 
player  besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! 
play  it plays everything , even vcd 's . 
 if only it played stand alone avi files . 
 if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating . 
 if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .

 well that is not true . 
 you could have paid more and got a lot less . 
 i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 ! 
 you have to ask yourself , "" how much money is dissapointment worth ? "" 
 because , you will be dissapointed . 
 then you can say , "" my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . "" 
 i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment ! 
 so , without further adoo . 
freeze , player  1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , "" dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "" 
remote  2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong . 
 3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken . 
 4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something ! 
universal remote control  5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control . 
 i dare you to surf the net and find the code . 
 you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work . 
code  finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 . 
 and then you will start to belive them . 
 if this is your fist dvd player . 
 save yourself some aggrivation .

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," fantastic dvd player for the price . 
 i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old . 
player  of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents . 
picture  the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv . 
loading  it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait . 
 also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short . 
player  but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," lots of sound but no picture ! 
 i bought this for my dad for christmas . 
picture  when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! 
 let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture . 
 as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin . 
 had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine . 
 save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," awkward remote ; flimsy build quality . 
dvd player  granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player . 
menu  first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds . 
 when i hit "" menu "" it told me , "" playback only . "" 
 i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu . 
menu  this is extemely lame . 
remote  the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use . 
remote  in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it . 
dvd  the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough . 
 it also has an optical out , which it should . 
 i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," a very embarassing gift . 
 i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places . 
player  after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift . 
dvd  it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches . 
dvd  both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going . 
speed  one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu . 
 these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player . 
door  the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed . 
size ,remote layout  there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote . 
player  all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," great - for the first three hours . 
player  i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died . 
 i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," you get what you pay for . 
player  i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category . 
player  i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine . 
noise , external display  there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance . 
look  still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! 
 so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch . 
freeze  i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! 
 ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter . 
 nothing ! 
player  i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it ! 
player  i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work ! 
 my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged . 
 upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause . 
 i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see . 
 the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question . 
 i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either . 
 guess where this unit is headed ? 
 yup , right back for a refund ! 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," more trouble than it 's worth times 10 . 
 i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player . 
 i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up . 
dvd , read  unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way . 
support  i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing . 
 i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," value for money . 
dvd player  this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it . 
 the plus points are - 
 1 . 
 price 
 2 . 
format  ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all 
 3 . 
look  good looks 
 the downside - 
 1 . 
quality  the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 
 2 . 
remote button  remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons . 
 if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," great cheap buy ! 
player  this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player . 
player  i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! 
apex  apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players . 
weight  also , very light and portable . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," apex 2600 . 
dvd disc , read  the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc . 
read , cd audio disc  it will read and play all cd audio disc . 
 guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one . 
 so far not going to get a good review . 
 a disipointed customer . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," hit and miss . 
amazon  i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far . 
 i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected . 
 that is where my satisfaction ends . 
 i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck . 
quality  however , it has failed to deliver on quality . 
jpeg  it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies . 
no disc  on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside . 
 after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common . 
apex  i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product . 
 i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future . 
 i guess you get what you pay for . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," the ad2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . 
silver plate  the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . 
 the case had ad2600 . 
 bait and switch . 
 picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate . 
 what is up . 
 clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined . 
 i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," moderately impressed . 
 i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers . 
 no go on most formats . 
play , cd , mp3 , jpeg  it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs . 
play , windows media , divx rip  however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips . 
 i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can . 
player  also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player . 
video quality  good quality video . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," apex ad-2600 compatability . 
 bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw 's and vcd 's . 
read , dvd , vcd  can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me . 
play , dvd-r  it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine . 
 i do n't have a dvd + r to try 
 so . 
price  mixed bag i guess but the price was right . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," great budget player . 
price  this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price . 
 it goes nicely with my apex 27 "" in my bedroom . 
build quality  the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) . 
 i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," fantastic bargain ! 
 hooray ! 
 think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ? 
 well , not with this one . 
look , player  it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims . 
format  i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did . 
product  i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems . 
direction  there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc . 
dvd player  so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! 
 only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath . 
 otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital ! 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," value value value . 
sound  noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah . 
work , player  works great ! 
color  silverish color really adds a special touch . 
 who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ? 
format  it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . ) 
 if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this ! 
 apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there . 
 if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours . 
 however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing . 
price  either way , can 't go wrong with this price . 
"
Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player," plays anything . 
dvd player  i am really impressed by this dvd player . 
 if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it . 
play , dvd  for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds . 
format  no matter the format . 
 awesome !

Canon G3,"excellent picture quality / color 
canon powershot g3  i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . 
use  the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
 after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . 
 i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . 
picture  they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
picture quality  a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
picture quality  i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
 ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . 
camera , use , feature  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
picture quality , use , option  i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
 great job canon ! 
"
Canon G3,"cool toy
 yep . 
camera  this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! 
 i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . 
picture  just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . 
use  whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . 
 + you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc. 
 as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) . 
 i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast . 
 a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . 
 some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ). 
dial    main dial is not backlit . 
viewfinder    lens visible in optical viewfinder . 
 ( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too . 
camera  overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
"
Canon G3,"canon g3 ? incredible camera 
 i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . 
 a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models . 
 following my research , i decided on the g3 . 
camera  in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera . 
speed ,picture quality  i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . 
auto setting  with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . 
 and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . 
camera  i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 . 
 do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed . 
"
Canon G3,"great camera 
canon g3  i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
photo quality  i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
feature  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
 flaws ? 
viewfinder  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . 
 still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
camera  despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography . 
"
Canon G3,"have n't had practice but i 'm already in love with it 
camera  i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
photo quality  the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . 
 i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) . 
 i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera . 
darn diopter adjustment dial  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) 
 i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review . 
"
Canon G3,"excellent for the semi-serious amateur 
 positives 
exposure control ,auto setting  1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 
metering option  excellent range of metering options as well . 
spot metering  it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
4mp  2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
zoom  3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
 4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . 
focus  5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 
focus  you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . 
 negatives 
size  1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
design  2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
viewfinder  4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
"
Canon G3,"fantastic digital camera 
feature ,  the camera has a wonderful set of features . 
lcd  the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . 
 you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd . 
optical zoom ,digital zoom  the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry . 
picture  the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
picture  i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . 
software  the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 
lens cap  the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
menu  the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
camera  it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
"
Canon G3,"the best of everything 
camera  recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
control  advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 
auto setting  newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
photo quality  4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . 
 do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype . 
 unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it . 
use  those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
 anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference . 
zoom  the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . 
 i expect the g3 will please me for years to come . 
"
Canon G3,"pure class & quality - a work of craftmanship 
camera  i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
picture , control , battery , software  it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . 
photo quality , auto mode  i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
 absolutely breathtaking . 
 i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out . 
 the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 . 
 i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb . 
 i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon . 
"
Canon G3,"great camera 
 what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ? 
 i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally . 
 at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons . 
 i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife . 
 i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it ! 
canera  this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . 
print  the prints are beautiful ! 
 and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality . 
 i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected . 
battery  although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . 
"
Canon G3,"if you love an slr 35mm but need to go digital 
camera  this is a great camera for you ! 
control ,auto mode  the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . 
 i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos ! 
control  i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . 
photo  i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers . 
 warning - i did read the manual ! 
control  but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! 
 once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located . 
dial  with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . 
manual mode  the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
 it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them ! 
feel  this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . 
feel  you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . 
camera  the more i work with it , the more i love it ! 
 i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow ! 
camera  i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
"
Canon G3,"outstanding camera 
camera  this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . 
 i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge . 
camera  seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . 
picture , auto mode  but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! 
four megapixel  four megapixels is great . 
 i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me . 
 if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download . 
 if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for . 
 if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it . 
product  it is a very amazing product . 
camera  i highly recommend it . 
"
Canon G3,"love my new g 3 
feature  just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . 
photo  takes excellent photos . 
night mode  night mode is clear as day . 
use  i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . 
viewfinder  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . 
 however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem . 
camera  overall it is the best camera on the market . 
 i give it 10 stars ! 
"
Canon G3,"noise level 
 this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 . 
"
Canon G3,"the pictures are brillient 
 i just bought the camera a few days ago . 
 before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings : 
picture quality  a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) 
lens cover  b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . 
 i wish canon would work out some way for that issue . 
zooming lever  the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . 
"
Canon G3,"great gadget 
 i bought this last week through amazon . 
 got a great deal from a reputable seller . 
camera  i love this camera . 
 i am still trying to figure out the may options it has . 
picture  took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
color ,white balance  great colors , pictures and white balance . 
optical zoom  has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . 
 it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for . 
"
Canon G3,"ok for a digital camera 
picture  maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . 
price  it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
camera  sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . 
 i do n't think i was asking too much . 
 any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort . 
 and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera . 
camera  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . 
 i wanted it to shoot concerts as well . 
 that meant even less light and just as much action . 
 sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 . 
grain  the grain was terrible . 
 next time i set it at 100 and used the flash . 
flash photo  well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . 
photo  when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . 
camera  the camera was a marvel . 
 getting the printer to help output them was another tale . 
 overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do . 
 for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital . 
 you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost . 
 then again a one time use camera may do just as well . 
 if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera . 
camera  it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . 
 me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) . 
 sure . 
 it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output . 
"
Canon G3,"within its limitations 
 i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias . 
 i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move . 
 what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses . 
 i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient . 
 hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations . 
g3  i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . 
lag time  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . 
 as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr . 
 at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available . 
depth  what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . 
 once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus . 
 now what about the flash problem ? 
flash  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . 
external flash hot shoe  fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . 
 i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 . 
 for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c . 
 in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself . 
flash  contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . 
 you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow . 
 then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored . 
 the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself . 
 this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away . 
 unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved . 
 the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) . 
 but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera . 
 the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you . 
 the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine . 
software  now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! 
software  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . 
 i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information . 
 maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces . 
 i didnt wait to experiment . 
 instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in . 
g3  what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
color  without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! 
g3  the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . 
software  what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . 
 what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . 
image  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
raw image  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .

Canon G3,"knock your socks off great 
camera  i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . 
camera  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . 
 my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time . 
battery life  battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . 
 whoa . 
manual function ,picture quality  manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . 
 i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck . 
viewfinder  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . 
 if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there . 
 or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it . 
"
Canon G3,"great digital camera 
 after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews . 
 the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try . 
 i 'm very glad i did . 
service  the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
 the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition . 
photo  having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . 
 recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition 
 -- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles . 
photo  by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . 
automode ,manual mode  the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . 
 in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom . 
viewfinder  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . 
 this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler . 
 but who cares ? 
 i always shoot using the lcd panel . 
camera  i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
"
Canon G3,"canon never ceases to amaze 
 being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 . 
canon  but canon never fails to amaze . 
 some of the great gains over g2 -- 
raw format  1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
battery life  2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . 
software  3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
 looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive . 
shape  4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . 
 a big plus in my book . 
 5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments . 
light auto correction  the light auto-correction is awesome . 
picture  you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . 
 6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes . 
 there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation . 
 7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view . 
 i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera . 
 ( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ). 
white offset  8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . 
 in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking . 
 9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep . 
 personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors . 
g3  overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . 
 there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize . 
 short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
camera  this is quite simply the best you can ask for . 
"
Canon G3,"love the g2 
 i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade . 
 big mistake . 
low light focus  the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 
picture  got way too many blurry pictures . 
 i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 ! 
"
Canon G3,"awesome pro-sumer camera 
 when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 . 
 yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power . 
 not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well . 
 her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use . 
 the nikon 's are great cameras . 
 + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures . 
 - the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format . 
 olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body . 
 + takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use . 
 - i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull . 
 photos had some artifacts and noise . 
 my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands . 
 we also looked at the fuji fps602 . 
 nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again . 
 fiance did n't like the feel . 
 the canon g3 . 
photo , use , software  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) 
 a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more . 
 the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own . 
 i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will . 
 always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do ! 
"
Canon G3,"upgraded from g2 and not looking back 
camera  the powershot g3 is a great camera . 
 why ? 
photo  because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
camera  4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . 
feature  it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . 
 make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time ! 
"
Canon G3,"the catch 
unresponsiveness  the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . 
 prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture . 
 no one told me , but i wanted to tell you . 
 this is not the same thing as a film camera . 
 and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs . 
 they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet . 
 most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera . 
 but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw : 
delay  it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . 
 i am not talking milliseconds . 
 picture this : 
 your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment . 
 when it arrives , you press the shutter release . 
 splash ! 
 the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot . 
 perhaps there is a way around this delay . 
 some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get . 
 yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay . 
 yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash . 
 but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera . 
 i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera . 
 it focuses in a snap . 
 dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board . 
delay  canon 's g3 does it consistently . 
focus , shoot  it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . 
 i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive . 
 and so i must ask , what are cameras for ? 
 what task do they perform ? 
 cameras capture moments . 
 they stop time . 
 because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back . 
 the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras . 
 a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture . 
 not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem . 
 like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone . 
 so buy the g3 . 
 buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever . 
 but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose . 
 from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to . 
g3  unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . 
"
Canon G3,"100 % happy 
camera  this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 
 i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it . 
picture quality  i love the quality of the pictures . 
picture quality  they look fantastic . 
 i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens . 
 it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments . 
"
Canon G3,"the best 4mp out there 
4mp camera  the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 
 i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital . 
picture  with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . 
control  i love the eos based controls and easy menus . 
 i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera . 
 many before me have done that already . 
 i agree with the positive reviews . 
 but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews . 
lens cap  1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . 
 though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself . 
 i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens . 
 very cheaply made . 
body  2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . 
 the g2 was better in this respect . 
casing  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . 
 despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera . 
"
Canon G3,"love it more and more 
 i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it ! 
 there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted . 
 i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research . 
 canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives . 
 i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands . 
 needless to say , the canon won , hands down . 
 this camera performs like i can not believe ! 
performance  i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! 
 it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode . 
camera  this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! 
battery life  another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! 
 i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one . 
 i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying . 
 this camera will stay with me for years ! 
"
Canon G3,"the last digital camera i 'll buy 
 i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time . 
 after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 . 
camera  am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
camera  i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy . 
 forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer . 
 i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual . 
menu  very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . 
 i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged . 
battery  the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging . 
 i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures . 
optical zoom  the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . 
viewfinder  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . 
 as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever . 
 these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives . 
camera  the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use . 
 highly recommended . 
 for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .

Canon G3,"boxy ? no -- gorgeous 
 you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions . 
 i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ? 
camera  because this camera is beautiful . 
 the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely . 
look  the g3 looks like a work of art ! 
finish  its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen . 
 the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them . 
"
Canon G3,"very good choice in it 's price range 
 this is my first digital camera . 
camera  i am very pleased with it so far . 
 i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time . 
 this seemed like a really good compromise . 
 i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 . 
 based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal . 
 it is not perfect though . 
 here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far : 
 it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera . 
viewfinder  you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . 
tiff format  ( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format . 
 that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw . 
 to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power . 
lag  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 
 trips . 
 ( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . ) 
 for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop . 
import  it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . 
 i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok . 
camera  i am quite happy with the camera . 
manual  it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep . 
camera  yes , i recommend it over the competition . 
"
Canon G3,"best of the best 
camera  best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything . 
stitch picture  this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website . 
 i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this . 
 for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer . 
"
Canon G3,"you 'll take more pics 
 i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera . 
picture  first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's . 
 save them on computer and print out just the ones who want . 
 duplicates are a no brainer and cheap . 
 no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers . 
 crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time . 
 the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier . 
 a great new use for that underutilized computer . 
 a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use . 
 poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film . 
camera  this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time . 
 my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera . 
 and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) . 
 get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash . 
 in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots . 
 i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 . 
 unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one . 
"
Canon G3,"excellent camera 
 i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera . 
 you can always spend more money to get a better one . 
camera  however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice . 
design , feature  it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! 
display  also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . 
 excellent idea ! 
compactflash  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . 
 however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras . 
noise  another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .

Canon G3,"cannon 
camera  i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything . 
camera  it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera .. 
"
Canon G3,"powerful product 
 bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations . 
use  in general it is easy to use and well laid out . 
 for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor . 
use  it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . 
feature  the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . 
auto mode  in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . 
 my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again . 
 the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses ! 
 this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this . 
 negative points : 
memory card  the included memory card is too small . 
 go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense . 
made  it is made of plastic . 
 for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience . 
 this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure . 
lens  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . 
 this is not a handbag camera . 
size  while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets . 
lever  the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile . 
flash  flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost . 
 the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography . 
strap  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . 
 if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble . 
 good points : 
camera  the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing . 
option[+1}, control  canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out . 
learning  learning how to use it will not take very long . 
image quality  the image quality is excellent . 
 messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results . 
 unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough . 
function  range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography . 
 please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used . 
 a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film . 
 i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first . 
"
Canon G3,"best camera i 've used 
camera  this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used . 
 it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box . 
macro , auto mode  the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot . 
"
Canon G3,"this camera is closest to perfect than any otherdigicam 
camera  this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . 
 beats that sony f717 ; its archrival . 
4mp resolution  i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; 
 i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways . 
 please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story . 
 my story is based on personal usage . 
distortion  yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . 
 moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon . 
 the distortion is not a flaw . 
 as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand . 
 i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this . 
shot  in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! 
picture ,learning curve  the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . 
 in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery . 
 based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots . 
 i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash . 
 the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it . 
 anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 . 
 it 's a winner . 
picture quality  i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind . 
 my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com . 
 they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's . 
 that 's what i did and hopes this helps . 
"
Canon G3,"canon g3 review / response / recommendation 
camera  the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood . 
picture  it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid . 
viewfinder  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . 
 ( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on . 
"
Canon G3,"beware 
 you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product . 
 although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of . 
 after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product . 
 i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" . 
 one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , "" actually we do n't ship on saturdays "" . 
 so why lie about it ? 
 so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet . 
 although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it . 
 they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" . 
 they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though ! 
 although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint . 
 i cancelled the order . 
 hope to get my refund in a timely manner . 
 thanks for nothing , amazon !

Canon G3,"major design flaw 
design  this camera has a major design flaw . 
viewfinder  when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . 
 i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera . 
 after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera . 
camera  everything else about the camera is great . 
camera  if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera . 
 however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much . 
 i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected . 
"
Canon G3,"i love it more the longer i own it 
 i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control . 
 i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price . 
 i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far . 
camera  and so far , i 've been very pleased . 
 there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures . 
lens ,optical zoom  the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . 
lcd  the moveable lcd screen is great . 
 you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself . 
remote  the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . 
 i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before . 
hot shoe flash  the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit : 
 i chose the canon speedlite 420 . 
 this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting . 
battery  i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : 
 i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery . 
battery charging system  the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery . 
manual  i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . 
 you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do . 
 negatives ? 
highlight  i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . 
 ( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . ) 
no-off button  the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . 
body  and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 . 
 i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution . 
download  i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . 
 i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images : 
 i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly . 
 at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough . 
 if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software ! 
 and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers . 
 the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you . 
 but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately . 
 added 2-24 . 
camera  i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it . 
 i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting . 
 it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings . 
 if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper . 
 i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker . 
 especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations . 
 i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) . 
 very easy to use . 
 i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too . 
camera  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price . 
"
Canon G3,"best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels 
g3  i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . 
 after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) . 
 it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more . 
 this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features . 
 it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice . 
camera  all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market . 
"
Canon G3,"the best so far 
 the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera . 
optic  canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . 
digital camera  simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . 
 the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage . 
 for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card . 
battery life  the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . 
look  the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . 
camera  even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . 
"
Canon G3,"great camera but g2 will do the same for less 
camera  definetely a great camera . 
quality  proven canon built quality and lens . 
feel  feels solid in hand . 
weight  rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros . 
"
Canon PowerShot SD500,"
SD500  We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500. 
design  It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested. 
image-processing system  A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition. 
image  The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality. 
 I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy. 
 I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias. 
 If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there. 
 I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do. 
pricey  I thought given all the ""10"" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey. 
LCD  I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen. 
 I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me. 
 I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered. 
 The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting. 
 It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office Â where no one goes but me. 
LCD  When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless. 
 I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise. 
camera  This camera is truely superb.
pictures  The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
manual control  Some more manual control would have been nice. 
 And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness. 
 Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
 I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs. 
pictures  They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact. 
 These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
Canon   I went out and got the Canon today. 
 WOW! Big difference! 
picture  I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!! 
quality  The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion. 
Canon  I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down. 
pictures  Sharper pictures. 
 More detail. More natural color. 
size  The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly. 
powers up  It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot. 
 I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking. 
 Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly. 
flash  The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered. 
 This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point. 
 A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad. 
image  Good image quality. 
 I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor. 
 Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price. 
 You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
pics ,user interface ,battery charger  All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
 I have had the SD500 for less than one week. 
LCD  After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem. 
 Wrong, except that my problems are different. 
 Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one. 
 Stored in a padded case. 
 Never abused. 
LCD  After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings. 
 LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken. 
 Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries. 
 All had the same results. 
weight  Camera is a paper weight. 
 Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around. 
 Expected better from a $500 unit.
SD500  I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
pictures  The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire. 
Powerup  Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on. 
640x480 mode  I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card). 
Camera shake  you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with. 
Audio  Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions. 
 I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
battery  The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got. 
 If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use. 
 and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
autofocus  The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can. 
compact  I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature. 
manual controls  Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls. 
 But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
image  Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality. 
focuses  My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not ""whine"" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp. 
 I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot. 
 I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered. 
camera  This camera is bulletproof. 
 It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions. 
 Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
start up  start up is so quick Â 
pictures  you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally! 
 totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
lcd  big lcd screen - at least for me, 2"" is enough
picture  great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great. 
quality  when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better 
zoom  digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
zoom  great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one). 
clips  i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
merge pictures  photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
camera  turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date. 
 shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally. 
 change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too. 
 i just thought it's cute and cool =)
battery   battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal. 
 (i can't help but play with the camera always)
sound  the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera. 
 i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud. 
 but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
camera  i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures. 
features  if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading 
 as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected. 
camera  it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
 i forgot to mention about the camera's design. 
designed  if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer. 
made  they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
camera  I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money. 
low-light conditions  Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash. 
 The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings. 
automatic settings  If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
camera  All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price. 
 But believe me, it's well worth it. 
Digic II chip  Having the Digic II chip helps a lot. 
pictures  This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat. 
starts up  I still can't believe how fast it starts up. 
camera  I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice. 
sd500  I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy. 
edges  I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit. 
 Buy it, you will love it..... 
camera  As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
LCD  The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice. 
 The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center. 
 I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
 I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care. 
 However, it was not so in my case.
 $500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me. 
 Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment. 
 In response to ""testing"" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage. 
 Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to ""useless"" instead of ""flimsy"".
 My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used. 
LCD  I took it out one day and the LCD was not working. 
 Who knowsÂ maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken. 
LCD  Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
 I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera. 
 All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do. 
camera  I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing. 
 I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it. 
size  The size of the camera is perfect. 
Fits  Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket. 
 When I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home. 
 So i figured i would ""compromise"" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere. 
 I Was wrong. 
camera  there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things. 
 In good light and low light the things a champ. 
pictures  I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality. 
flash  The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent. 
 If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
camera  I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera. 
 You will not be dissapointed!
camera ,movie mode  This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot. 
instruction  The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
camera  I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great. 
photo  The photo quality is amazing. 
feels  it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too. 
prints  I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
image  As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen. 
colors  another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
camera  Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go. 
 Highly recommended.
camera  As it turns out, this is an awesome camera! 
 If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
 The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves. 
 CNET told you not to look for advanced controls. 
preset ,user definable  However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes. 
advanced controls  I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel. 
software  The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed. 
camera  Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
pictures  I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality. 
 Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise. 
 I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500. 
 If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
camera  Very good ""every day"" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
looking  If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you! 
 Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the ""digital"" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
camera   am so glad I bought this camera. 
SD500  All the good reviews for the SD500 are true. 
view finder  The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer. 
software  The included software removes any red eye easily. 
pics  if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500. 
 Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
camera  This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used. 
 Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas. 
buttons ,user interface  Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect. 
power button  The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click. 
buttons  The buttons are rather stiff. 
switch  I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot. 
build ,white balance  overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
camera  Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight. 
camera  When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive. 
flash  In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes). 
 The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good). 
 I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500. 
 For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed. 
settings  Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
focus  I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
camera  I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results. 
color  Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro. 
Picture  Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings. 
 I use ""get ready"" and ""here it comes"". 
manual  The manual is excellent. 
 Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots. 
 To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display. 
multiple picture  Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
powerup ,multiple pictures  Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures. 
size  Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds. 
 Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web. 
 CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review. 
 Check this one out for yourself for sure!
 I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time. 
 I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up! 
camera  I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
 This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever. 
 Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance. 
camera  I love the camera.
compact  This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation. 
 Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem. 
responce  The camera responce is VERY quick. 
 Almost no lag between button activation and shutter. 
 Camera powers on and ready in about a second. 
pics  I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face. 
 that u missed in the mirror! 
 Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics. 
video  And the video quality is amazing. 
 On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!! 
fits  And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30. 
 An A++!!!
camera  I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites. 
automatic shutter  There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens. 
 It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time. 
 Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry. 
controls  The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark. 
LCD  The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
"
Canon S100,"
small  I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
 Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.  
camera  I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
memory  The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
room  I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
memory  A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
pictures  Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
camera  I'd say that this camera is perfect.
"
Canon S100,"
compact  OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
"
Canon S100,"
size  I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
small  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
 I take it with me everywhere,literally, 
small  it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
covering  There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
picture  The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
picture  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
 However, I do have a few things to complain about...  
battery  First off, the battery.
battery  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
battery  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
 The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
batteries  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
zoom  Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
zooms  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
 Very wrong.  
zoom  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
start-up  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
flash  The flash is very weak.
 Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
macro  The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
auto-focus  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
work  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
focus  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
 These are all the flaws I found in the camera, 
cameras  it's not my first choice in cameras,
size  I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
camera  If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.

Canon S100,"
 I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100... 
s100  after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
"
Canon S100,"
 I have had this little gem for four months now. 
camera  It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
 I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
 I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera. 
 I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted. 
small  1) It is perhaps too small. 
buttons  I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
size  Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
delay  2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. 
autofocus  This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
resolution setting  3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
 (I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
hot  4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
hot  It is hot enough to be annoying.
 Canon says it's normal. 
 I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
"
Canon S100,"
small  This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
snapshots  It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
"
Canon S100,"
 I have used many digital cameras. 
camera  This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
pictures  Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
wait  Hate to wait between shots
Download  Download it fast to your computer
bundled software  Have a great and easy to use bundled software
size  Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
"
Canon S100,"
Battery  FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
color and light  The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
camera  I love this camera.
"
Canon S100,"
camera  I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
smallest  It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
"
Canon S100,"
 I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it. 
purchase  I am very pleased with my purchase.
 It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
"
Canon S100,"
camera  I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
camera  This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
snapshots  It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
Exposure  Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
flash , mode  Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
zoom range  The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
body  The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
"
Canon S100,"
body  It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
 A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to ""digital zoom"")
"
Canon S100,"
lcd  I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
design  I then realized a major design flaw.
functionality  All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
screen  When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
"
Canon S100,"
 I wrote another review and this is the update. 
manual mode  I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
"
Canon S100,"
 I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures. 
 I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card. 
 Here are some useful facts:- 
 On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures. 
 A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture). 
viewfinder  The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
 The LCD should be used.
 However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder. 
zoom  The digital zoom is crap.
 Turn it off. 
fits  It fits in your pocket.
 The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp). 
 But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
 I take my camera everywhere. 
 Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera. 
 The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff. 
panorama setting  The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
 You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing ! 
pictures  The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
flash  You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
"
Canon S100,"
S100  The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
movie mode  The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
mode  It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a ""Normal"" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
price  The price is $... more.
"
Canon S100,"
software  I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
 I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
drivers  The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
software  The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
pictures  But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
"
Canon S100,"
camera  I love this camera!
memory   the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
"
Canon S100,"
price  I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
camera  I would recommend this camera unequivocally!

 My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
 The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
 The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
battery  But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
"
Canon S100,"
 I've been using this camera for a few months now.
camera  A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
"
Canon S100,"
 Good quality and fun!
Elph s100  I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
 I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
 In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
exposure  The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
"
Canon S100,"
 My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
smaller  But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
"
Canon S100,"
S100  This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
light  This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
software  The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
 I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
software  The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
 I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
on-camera controls  My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
work  I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
camera  Other than that, I love this camera.
pictures ,color rendering  The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
"
Canon S100,"
size ,metal case ,picture quality  The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
"
Canon S100,"
size  If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
image quality  The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
"
Canon S100,"
 Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
 One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
 While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
 I said, can your fancy camera do that?
 No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
 End of story.
"
Canon S100,"
camera  I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
product  I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
 I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
product  This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
"
Canon S100,"
 I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid ""legacy"" photographer for most of mylife.
jewel  I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
usability  I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
"
Canon S100,"
 I've had this camera for three years.
 price I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
 I put a 128MB CF card in it.
camera  First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
 I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
software  The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
camera  The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
 If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
pictures  All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
sharp ,color balance  They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
pictures of people  When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
 Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
 It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
pics  Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
processing  I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
 By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
 I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
"
Canon S100,"
 I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
 I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
 I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
 This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
camera  I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
size  First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
 The included battery charger is larger!
use  Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
photos  I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
use  The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
optical zoom  The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
software  I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
 I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
 But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
 And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
 One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
 Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
 This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
 I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
 As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
 I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
S100  At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
camera  It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
"
Canon S100,"
 Why did I wait so long?  detail ,color rendition  If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
 Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions: 
"
Canon S100,"
 got this as it flew off the shelves.
use  Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
 What else can I say?     
"
Canon S100,"
compact  I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
memory expansion ,macro mode  I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
 This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
small  Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
lens  The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
housing  The metal housing seems very rugged.
 Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
automatic modes  I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
auto mode  For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
auto color balance  The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
 You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
dynamic range  The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
macro mode  The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
LCD  The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
panorama modes  The panorama modes are wonderful.
 Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
 High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
small  It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
auto mode  In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
manual modes  The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
 1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
light  There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
 It's a little jewel.
"
Canon S100,"
Small  1- Small.
smal  VERY smal.
 You'll carry it with you every day.
 I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
cameras  I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
picture quality  2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
 Fool proof.
 I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
 3- USB kicks!
 2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
Looks  4- Looks great.
case  Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
software  5- Excelent software package.
TFT screen  6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
 Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
TFT  Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
panorama mode  7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
buttons  8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
buttons  Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
 9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.

Canon S100,"
canon s100  i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
 and i'm glad i did!
"
Canon S100,"
ease of use ,picture detail  I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
size  This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
ease of use  Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
 I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
 Definitely a good investment.
"
Canon S100,"
controls ,ease of use  The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
 I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
 I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
 Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
zoom  The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
capacity  This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
 While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
"
Canon S100,"
 I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
size  So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size  because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
 If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
"
Canon S100,"
 My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
 Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
"
Canon S100,"
 I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
size  After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
"
Canon S100,"
pictures  I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
size  The size is tiny, which I love.
 We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
pictures  Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 ""adjust levels"" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
"

 OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
 Thank you Santa!
"

 I bought this camera at the end of August.
 With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
 I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
"
Canon S100,"
 I've got a couple of digital cameras.
 An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
 Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
 BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.
"
Canon S100,"
 I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
 The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
 I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
 The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
"
Canon S100,"
 Positives:
"
Canon S100,"
ease of use  This camera is so easy to use!
 I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
features  All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
 I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
pictures  The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
"
Canon S100,"
price ,ease of use  I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
 Well wait no more!
"
Canon S100,"
fun  I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
size  You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
 You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," a quick update to the new zen nx ? 
 this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device . 
affordability  while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability . 
bang-for-the-buck  it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there . 
size ,navigational system , sound  like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) . 
screen  the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better . 
 further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 . 
 this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties . 
 when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit . 
 yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model . 
 yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) . 
 for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," get this player ! 
 before i decided to get this player , i did my research . 
 i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player . 
deal  i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money . 
wma file  another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it . 
 that takes up half the space of mp3 's . 
 that 's important because i have a lot of music . 
software  the software is great . 
 you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories . 
software  transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy . 
battery life  even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good . 
accessory  only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet . 
remote  i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard . 
interface  they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use . 
 can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon . 
player  get it , it 's woth every penny ! ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," kick a player 
 i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod . 
player  i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it . 
 if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't . 
 pros : 
software  software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money ) 
price  much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate 
 no issues as of yet 
 cons : 
headphone  you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck 
 hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod . 
 if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod . 
 otherwise , be smart , save the cash . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," the sound is the thing ! 
 for me the sound of the music is what is important . 
sound  the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s . 
navigation  navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well . 
weight  at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod . 
battery ,leather case  the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) . 
 i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music . 
software  so far the software for the pc works easily . 
looking  by the way , it looks nice also . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," an ipod killer : 
 this thing kicks mighty apple butt ! 
 i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars . 
player  it 's worth it . 
 i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else . 
 after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for . 
battery life  my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both . 
 this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time . 
 the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway ! 
sound , headphone  the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones . 
 you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans. 
control  the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! 
scroll wheel  the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad . 
size  it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . 
screen  the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue . 
firewire  it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves . 
 ( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however ) 
leather pouch  the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices . 
battery  other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod . 
 ( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? ) 
 i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models . 
 since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make . 
size  overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! 
battery  ( batteries last longer too ! ) 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," way better than a i-pod ! 
 i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was . 
 after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was . 
 it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money . 
player , price  the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player . 
player  i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever . 
menu  the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen . 
screen  the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long . 
player , software  all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) . 
 just get some new headphones and your set . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," great product for a windows computer . 
 within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files . 
program  it 's a very intuitive program . 
installation  i had no problems following their installation instructions . 
menu  the menus are very easy to navigate . 
scroll wheel  the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks . 
control  the other controls are all very easy to use . 
play option  it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist . 
playlist  the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer . 
 unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box . 
 for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs. 
price  it also costs a lot less than the ipod . 
earbud  the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad . 
earbud  they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality . 
deal  this is a good deal for music and data storage . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," the interfacing software is unacceptably bad . 
 one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored . 
software  the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software . 
 on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers . 
 despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually . 
software  the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . 
 with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop . 
 i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program . 
player  the player itself has all sorts of problems . 
face plate  the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . 
file transfer  the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . 
scroll  the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others . 
scroll  depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . 
scroll  the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 
sound  on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured . 
audio  i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs . 
player  overall , a very disappointing product . 
setup  the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par . 
player  the player 's mechanics are also flawed . 
player  although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," great player . 
 i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra . 
price  when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat . 
 if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. . 
 this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds . 
 i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me . 
scroll  one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like . 
this thing  other than that this thing is great ... 
 enjoy ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," replaceable battery lets zennx keep running and running . 
battery  zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod . 
 all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) . 
 apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) . 
battery  the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance . 
earphone  deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). 
 notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx . 
screen  the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky . 
 zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ). 
 choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery . 
 zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery . 
 update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory . 
 lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage . 
 still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," terrific mp3 player , great price . 
nomad  i love my new nomad , its great ! 
 now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home . 
look this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod . 
price  for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison . 
software  the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds . 
case  the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) . 
headphone , sound  on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof ! 
 if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) . 
deal , mp3 player  but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad . 
player  best electronic i 've bought since i was born . 
 flat out 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," impressed ! 
 i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit . 
 i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive . 
 for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player . 
 i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player . 
 this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type . 
 after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. . 
 i will just say this : 
 i will never go back to my archos again ! ! 
set up  so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos . 
 stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing . 
nomad explorer  just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc. 
player  not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy . 
design  very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has . 
leather case  the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly . 
button  all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand . 
sound quality  the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with . 
sound option  lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . 
navigation  navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 
navigation  also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player . 
 it was impossible to do so before . 
screen saver  oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^ 
file limit  another plus in my book , no file limits ! 
 i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want . 
playlist  i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 
storage  i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder . 
 now i can transport files to friends house with ease . 
 when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load . 
 after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price ! 
player  i really have no complaints over this unit . 
player  i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player . 
 in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," not able to install . 
installation  getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience . 
 the cd just has too many problems with win xp . 
 i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works . 
manual  also , the instruction manual is very bad . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," fantastic piece of machinery . 
player  i have no complaints with this mp3 player . 
file transfer  getting files onto it is quick and painless . 
sorting  then sorting the files is easy as pie . 
storage  and it holds sooooo much music and audio files . 
player  my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems . 
sound  also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with . 
 come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones . 
 sheesh ! ! 
battery  the battery is nice . 
 i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them . 
screen  the lcd screen was very large and readable . 
 thank you ! 
 my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts . 
 a great buy . 
player  compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," not ipod competition . 
 i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) . 
 you 're talking totally different hardware . 
 all of the zens use a standard notebook drive . 
 this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ). 
 the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) . 
 the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 . 
 i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod . 
 the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 . 
 that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range . 
 i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices . 
 advertising pays off i guess .. . 
 i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player . 
zen  i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class . 
 my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ). 
 i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," ipod vs nomad zen xtra 
 i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player . 
 after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments : 
transfer  transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 . 
transfer  it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error . 
 having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered . 
scroll wheel  scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling . 
size  size - bigger than the ipod 
software  software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut . 
 after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod . 
 song transfers were not an issue . 
 i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire . 
 the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did . 
 the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small . 
 the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this . 
sound quality  sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features . 
 i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase . 
 granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it . 
 itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," wonderful . 
player  i love this player . 
 its great . 
player  all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since . 
player  i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again . 
software  the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) . 
 i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so . 
 it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs . 
player  anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," a good product . 
size ,folder structure  first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture . 
 the pro ... 
price  way less expensive than the ipod . 
 my opinions : 
 personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. . 
interface  i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. . 
 it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list . 
 meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list . 
folder structure  the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . 
chinese name  and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title .. 
 and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese .. 
 if it had the same number of "" ? "" s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of "" ? "" s. . . 
 buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) . 
 i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand . 
transfer  not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless . 
 once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel . 
 and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done . 
 in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ). 
 so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about . 
 of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too . 
 you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc. 
 the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since . 
 did i mention i 've already dropped it once ? 
 that was n't pretty . 
 there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close . 
 hehe , my bad . 
 that 's all for now . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," so far , it 's sweet . 
xtra  bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent . 
storage  i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it . 
 i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing . 
 i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit . 
interface  both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice . 
 besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either . 
transfer  ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) . 
case  people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection . 
case  it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to . 
sound quality , battery  the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) . 
option  you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) . 
 i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer ! 
button  the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing . 
button  my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go . 
 not an urgent issue , as it still works .. . 
button  all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well . 
 i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road . 
support  but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. . 
 we 'll see if i need them to . 
size  sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much . 
 this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway . 
size  it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy . 
 i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday . 
 yes . 
 get better headphones . 
 rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it . 
product  bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price . 
 i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! ) 
 basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay . 
 i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," nightmare . 
 awful , awful , awful . 
id3 tag  unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks . 
id3 tag  if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders . 
 it 's a shame , but mine is going back . 
 bummer as it has great sound quality . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," excellent product . 
player  i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . 
 my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time .. 
 just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together . 
 the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go . 
 so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift . 
setup , transfer  the setup and transfer process was cake for me . 
 i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player . 
transfer  i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem . 
explorer  the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again . 
 it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened . 
 that 's probably a bad thing . 
player  the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well . 
 it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors . 
player  now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems . 
screen  the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it . 
 i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there . 
eax mode  the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 
jog dial  the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it . 
 the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model . 
mp3 player  all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player . 
 i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy . 
 highly recommended !

Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," fantasic product . 
nomad  i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! 
installation  i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver . 
 this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver . 
software  i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy . 
 if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button . 
playlist  ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier . 
mediasource  i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer . 
 just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done ! 
playback quality  being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable . 
 i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds . 
sound  when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! 
sound quality  the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior . 
nomad  actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated . 
finding  finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy . 
 i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd . 
screen  the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight . 
use , playback quality  i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," good value . 
player  just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date . 
size  nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something . 
sound quality  all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) . 
eax  the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative . 
player  i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment . 
 dislikes 
control  - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones . 
fly wheel  the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use . 
button  the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
software  - included creative software is pretty poor . 
 red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software . 
 note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it 
 likes 
price  - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price 
sound  - best in class sound 
screen  - large easy readable screen 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," depressingly poor quality . 
 after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 . 
 the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever . 
 i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" . 
 at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air . 
play  i tried to play the song three times , with no success . 
play  it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk . 
 well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work . 
 i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page . 
 needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product . 
software  had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," wonderful . 
 charged my battery . 
 plugged it in . 
 installed software . 
 started ripping and transferring . 
 if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs . 
 i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go . 
player  working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! ! 
player  i love it ! ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," poor reliability . 
 i bought this only to have it break within a month . 
player  this product is too fragile for normal use . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," good player , but this technology is not yet great . 
 i received this as a gift . 
software  i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred . 
software  however , the creative software is not real intuitive . 
software  the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest . 
rename  if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . 
 you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player . 
transfer  transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 . 
sound  it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds . 
earbud  i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players . 
storage  i love the storage in this thing . 
 i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive . 
 i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know . 
 this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd . 
 now my dissapointments . 
 the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd . 
 the warranty is 90 days . 
warranty  this is ridiculous . 
 to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year . 
 buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) . 
scroll wheel  the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . 
scroll wheel  seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection . 
interface  the interface used could be better designed . 
interface  it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . 
 i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers . 
case  and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control . 
case  it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it . 
 the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it . 
control  the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . 
 there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it . 
player  despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. . 
lock up  however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times . 
 i have had it lock up after a transfer of music . 
 the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery . 
 also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call . 
 left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over . 
 could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen . 
 again had to remove the battery . 
 there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details . 
firmware  quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time . 
 there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before . 
 i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error . 
 now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one . 
 i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology . 
 and we all know about the rush to market on new products . 
 i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit . 
 while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one . 
warranty  i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," excellent product . 
player  this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product . 
 first let me give you the bad things : 
size  1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more . 
scroll  2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select . 
 3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad . 
sound quality  first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . 
software  the player 's software is very easy to use and very good . 
software  compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use . 
player  to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," difficulties with tags . 
 if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player . 
 otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all . 
player  this thing seriously is a good player though . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," another electronics fan . 
 summary 
unit  overall i like the unit . 
player  i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) . 
 if it were not for that i would have given it 4 . 
 pros : 
price  1 ) price / gb of storage 
storage  2 ) storage capacity 
battery  3 ) user replaceable battery 
 cons : 
construction  1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) 
scroll  2 ) scroll button / switch 
case  3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing . 
 features that would have been nice : 
 1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this . 
 2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo . 
 they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck . 
 but who wants the wires involved . 
 a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer . 
 i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature . 
 details : 
 do n't drop this unit : 
 i 've had the player for about a month now . 
player  overall i like it . 
 as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days . 
 i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke . 
 i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) . 
 i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement . 
 if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you . 
 i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement . 
 updating the unit 's firmware : 
 when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website . 
 the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions . 
 i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation . 
 storage : 
storage  the storage capacity is great . 
 i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb . 
 i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet . 
 i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place . 
 for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels . 
 typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps. 
 the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size . 
 if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps . 
 you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player . 
 if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ). 
 price : 
price  the price compared to the ipod is great . 
price  price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad . 
 one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes . 
 i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format . 
 it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad . 
 i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes . 
itunes  but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes . 
 scroll bar : 
scroll  the scroll bar is a bit of a pain . 
 sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items . 
 it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice . 
 software : 
software  i 've had no problems with the software . 
software  i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) . 
 the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to . 
 my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ). 
 through the software you can classify songs in genres . 
software  this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem . 
software  the software comes with plenty of defaults genres . 
 you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications . 
 you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later . 
 this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass . 
 in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player . 
 this is pretty cool . 
 sound : 
sound  the sound from the player is ok . 
sound  i was a little disappointed in the low end . 
 i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended . 
 i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base . 
sound  the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected . 
 it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ). 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," searching for dennis ! 
 wow , dennis sure is great ! 
 slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror . 
this thing  this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records . 
 sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ? 
 i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years . 
 there was very little light in there . 
 anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," it is ok , but .. . 
 i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago . 
 it was not my first choice . 
 i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra . 
storage  one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) . 
price  for the price and features it is really good . 
 one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes . 
 sure enough there is no such ability . 
 not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear . 
navigation  in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . 
navigation  you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division . 
 creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features . 
software  the software , which comes with player is not good at all . 
nomad explorer  i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . 
 after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad . 
 notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product . 
 transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other . 
 often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables . 
 artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory . 
 after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required . 
 the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," the bundled software blows , yes ... ... but i heard of notmad explorer ( http://redchairsoftware.com) from the creative tech support people . 
 i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price . 
software  so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly . 
 for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent . 
 dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind . 
 zens rule . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," unmatched quality and beyond cool . 
 originally i wanted the ipod . 
 most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist . 
 i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod . 
zen  the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car . 
 so what ? 
 i can do that myself . 
battery life ,online music service ,pc compatibility  longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities . 
 the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity . 
 i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to . 
 however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences . 
 i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields . 
 it can get pretty lonely out there . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," creative thinking . 
player  i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it . 
sound ,battery life  the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent . 
 the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use . 
style  the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to . 
player  so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing . 
 i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order . 
 is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ? 
 i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering . 
 thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," got to get an ipod ! 
 wow .. . 
player  this thing is trash . 
 want the laundry list of reasons why ? 
 of course you do ! 
construction  a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop 
screen  b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
scroll  c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said 
software  d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on 
case  e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
look  f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course 
 so .. . 
 im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead . 
 do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," do n't buy it . 
 i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift . 
 what a disappointment . 
software  the software failed repeatedly . 
 i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed . 
customer support website  creative labs customer support website is useless . 
software  software downloads on the site crashed my pc . 
 creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this . 
 do n't buy this thing . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," great mp3 player . 
player  i just bought this player today and i already love it . 
play  it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd . 
scroll  another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on . 
player  otherwise , this player is awesome ! 
screen  it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily . 
volume range  the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want . 
player  overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," perfect purchase . 
this item  i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 
price  naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable . 
value  compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops . 
 - price : see above . 
sound quality  - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company . 
use  - the unit is easy to use and intuitive . 
 it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls . 
uploading  - uploading music is quick and easy . 
software  although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent . 
 i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! ) 
 btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization . 
player  - the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't . 
scroll  as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible . 
 structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you . 
screen  the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool . 
feature  there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization . 
battery  - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily . 
 ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement . 
battery life  also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy . 
equipment  - equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for . 
case  the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) . 
headphone  the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead . 
 conclusion : 
player  this player is an ideal purchase . 
 there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features . 
 i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," impressive with few flaws . 
player  the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt . 
player  i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player . 
software  on my main computer the software did not work right . 
customer support  i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all . 
 i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself . 
player  i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic . 
 it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have . 
player  so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," awesome . 
zx  i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review . 
 first there 's the unit itself . 
size  it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . 
sound quality  the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so . 
lcd  the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did . 
scroll wheel  the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate . 
sound  the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product . 
eax  the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle . 
enviromental audio  the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . ) 
signal to noise ratio  the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods . 
software  the software has n't been a hassle for me at all . 
 i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes . 
 my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence . 
 the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . ) 
price  lastly , the price is fantastic : 
 i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 . 
 for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves . 
 if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," it 's pretty good . 
 read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! ! 
 ( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) . 
 and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need . 
 eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures ) 
software  i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems . 
 transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds . 
 it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds . 
usb 2.0  usb 2.0 - very fast 
earbud  yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . 
sound  but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers . 
recharger  and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 
look  it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light . 
scroll  the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it . 
player  i am very pleased so far . 
 i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ). 
 so far so good , no problems , no conversions . 
use  very simple to use . 
 the reason it does not get 5 stars 
battery  1 ) a spare battery would have been great . 
game  2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it . 
work  3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players 
use  all in all suprisingly easy to use . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," a great player for the price . 
 summary : 
sound quality  lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy . 
 pros : 
sound  excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . 
 there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled . 
transfer  transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad . 
 i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software . 
 however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players . 
 you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection . 
 this would have been much easier . 
 the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk . 
transfer  i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . 
 this almost made it worth the price alone . 
 i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's . 
storage  huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing . 
 30gb is more than enough for most people . 
transfer  having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers . 
 it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file . 
 it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs . 
 cons : 
navigation  navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs . 
 this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't . 
 it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system . 
 you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it . 
 whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags. 
fm receiver  fm receiver - it has none . 
 i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations . 
 that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether . 
construction  cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners . 
feel  the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . 
 i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet . 
feel  as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable . 
 the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable . 
 i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to . 
 this is not a player you can take jogging . 
play  the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd . 
 you have to add them to the playing list . 
 i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next . 
 you have to add all the songs to a play list . 
 there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet . 
software  software - the software is crap . 
rip cd  i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of . 
software  otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward . 
 like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it . 
instruction  even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . 
 i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet . 
line out jack  no line out jack - as i said , there is none . 
 the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack . 
 so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack . 
line out jack  it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack . 
control  controls are a bit awkward . 
 the controls definately took some getting used to . 
control  it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . 
 when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was . 
 a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included . 
 i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it . 
headphone  crappy headphones . 
earbud  the included earbuds were uncomfortable . 
 i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones . 
navigation  difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate . 
navigation  it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly . 
navigation  i think this is it 's biggest flaw . 
 i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes . 
control  up , down , left , and right would have given me better control . 
scroll wheel  if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . 
 case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case . 
case  it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack . 
 that way i could keep it in the case all the time . 
case  as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand . 
 you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though . 
player  overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it . 
sound , price , player  i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," good for the money , but software is awful . 
 after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one . 
price  for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price . 
 a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing . 
 i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation . 
button  the buttons and interface are very easy to use . 
click buttons , display  simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use . 
software  but the major problem i had was with the software . 
 you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them . 
instruction  the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple . 
sync  the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . 
transfer  i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused . 
 i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player . 
 well that was not a simple task . 
 i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer . 
 i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate . 
 buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," buy this instead of an ipod . 
mp3 player  with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod . 
 an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper . 
 the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" . 
interface  i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer . 
 also the ipod has games on it . 
 games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," this thing roxxorz . 
 i purchased this player last week . 
 i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on . 
 i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway . 
product  i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product . 
software  the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine . 
headphone  the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity . 
battery life  the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs . 
navigation  took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo . 
player  i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box . 
product  all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product . 
 if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you . 
size  it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well . 
product  i would recommend this product to anyone . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," it does n't get any better than this . 
player  before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there . 
software  many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me . 
cd rip  the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive . 
software  the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple . 
control  the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual . 
player  the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium . 
battery  the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files . 
playlist  playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists . 
software  the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," difficult to manage large library . 
 i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design . 
player  it is an extremely cool gizmo . 
 in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it . 
 so what 's the problem ? 
 i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device . 
 i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 . 
 i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me . 
 the reasons below will be true for any product in this category . 
 here 's why : 
 1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office . 
 i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation . 
 2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . ) 
 3 . it 's a hazard in the car . 
navigation  the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving . 
 ( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a . 
playlist  creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked . 
 the bottom line : 
 if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk . 
 sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks . 
 one major complaint : 
sound quality  my only significant complaint is sound quality . 
eax  the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . 
 this did not give me enough control . 
 i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter . 
sound quality  i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . "" 
 the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad . 
 one minor complaint : 
 the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity . 
 gee ... thanks a lot creative . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," great product . 
 well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players . 
 so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) . 
 so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one . 
 well i decided to get this one . 
product  well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket . 
product  well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) . 
program  well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze . 
 enjoy . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," in a word ... amazing i got this for christmas . 
 i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ; 
 it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. . 
 what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy . 
price , player  not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have . 
 anyway , on with the review . 
 so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life . 
battery life  it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ). 
 software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining . 
 once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers . 
 from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ). 
id3 tag  my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them . 
 if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do . 
transfer  oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy . 
 the player : it 's silver . 
weight  a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . 
 people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) . 
scroll wheel  it 's easy . 
button  the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate . 
backlight  the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see . 
eax  my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature . 
 you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ). 
eax  its really cool . 
sound quality  sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) . 
song speed  you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too . 
earbud  but the earbuds suck ! 
 buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out . 
 for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones . 
 a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it . 
 oh ... one more thing . 
case  i forgot , the case does n't fit . 
case  my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great . 
 so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that . 
 so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden . 
storage  also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy . 
 hope i helped ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," simply doesnt shine . 
 i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. . 
 what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. . 
 based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. . 
 but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. . 
 now we come to the zen xtra .. . 
player hardware  first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. . 
sound  the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. . 
software  what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . 
 not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software . 
 first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . . 
bookmark  bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. . 
bookmakr  rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . 
bookmark  this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. . 
playlist  the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. . 
 well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. . 
 i 'll just say this .. . 
 for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ... 
 but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," excellent product with a few minor problems . 
 i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive . 
 over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive . 
 many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend . 
price  while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player . 
 also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ). 
nomad  i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it . 
weight ,battery life  it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life . 
storage capacity  the storage capacity is great for me -- 
 i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free . 
control  the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price . 
load  loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well . 
 i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead . 
 my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer . 
 this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work . 
 if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly . 
 i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker . 
tag  my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . 
 when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks . 
 while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd . 
 the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance . 
 for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock . 
 perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock . 
 you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it . 
 a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names . 
 this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad . 
 again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you . 
tag  other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system . 
 if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second . 
 this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi . 
 i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately . 
 the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing . 
software  also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order . 
playlist  finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . 
 in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it . 
 you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately . 
 you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist . 
 these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them . 
 had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner . 
 also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue . 
product  the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product . 
 apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," poor substitute for an ipod . 
 simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod . 
 even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," zen versus ipod . 
 i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) . 
 while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better . 
 software : 
software  a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes . 
sync  first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer . 
 the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player . 
shuttle  the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) . 
sync  second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer . 
 since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod . 
 if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone ! 
player  the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player . 
software  third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer . 
cd burner  only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . 
 lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs . 
 if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 . 
 itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy . 
creative  for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages . 
 player controls : 
 here 's where the ipod drives me nuts . 
 the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally . 
 if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in . 
 the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player . 
scroll  zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player . 
remove  it also lets you remove songs from the play order . 
delete  if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order . 
 you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod . 
 lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself . 
 while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc. 
 none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent . 
 again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional . 
 i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines . 
 win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs . 
 with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it . 
 if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen . 
zen  its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus. 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," excellent alternative . 
this thing  i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since . 
 i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things . 
 my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes . 
control  the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," excellent . 
 i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player . 
 i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far . 
software  the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered . 
headphone  as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! 
the unit  the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! 
 i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference . 
unit  overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," review for folks new to mp3s . 
 i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around . 
 here 's a basic run-down from what i learned : 
 flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost 
 mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them . 
 the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact . 
 that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size . 
 tiny ! 
 mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory . 
 i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory . 
 ( 1 gb = 1,000 mb ) 
 hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) . 
 cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around . 
 that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory . 
 just be aware of it . 
 this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players . 
 a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more . 
 it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive . 
 that 's the first thing to understand . 
 so consider what you 're going to use the device for . 
 if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory . 
 if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books . 
 review of zen xtra - 40 gb 
 the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity . 
size  this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size . 
case  it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly . 
cover  the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid . 
 as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it . 
 it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot . 
 the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name . 
software  extremely convenient . 
 then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer . 
 you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player . 
 ( wo n't leave copy on your computer . ) 
 the pros and cons of it : 
price  great price . 
 the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory . 
software  i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all . 
scroll  the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal . 
 it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here . 
size  it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it . 
 for me , that was the only drawback . 
player  i 'm really happy with this purchase . 
 also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability . 
 if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause . 
 after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't . 
 so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed . 
 if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it . 
size  i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," what a beast . 
 i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it . 
 it is a beast . 
 if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox . 
screen  now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here . 
size  there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall . 
case  but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything . 
price  ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," yet another inferior knockoff . 
 granted this is cheaper than an ipod . 
 cheaper in every way . 
weight  its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . 
playlist  its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) . 
battery life  it also has unproven battery life . 
 everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies . 
 use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) . 
 while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it . 
 i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do . 
software  finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best . 
 before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," good player , bad software . 
 pros : 
price    price and capacity 
design    slick-looking design and improved interface 
battery    removable battery 
 cons : 
case    protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window . 
 had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife . 
 how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ? 
scroll    scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models . 
 does n't always register push-button movement . 
eax    eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files . 
 i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling . 
volume    does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ). 
software    software is absolutely terrible : 
transfer  -- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ). 
recognition  -- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library . 
change  -- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks . 
software  -- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best . 
 if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc . 
 final verdict : 
player , rip , transfer  a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," excellent way to carry your music collection ! 
 after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas . 
size  despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! 
cd rip  i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me . 
transfter  file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 . 
 several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title . 
 this is possible ! ! 
 since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album . 
 solution ? 
 simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names . 
 using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums . 
 even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player . 
software  my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field . 
 weird . 
 how does it sound ? 
sound  to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player . 
 no complaints there . 
eax  the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train . 
navigation  navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . 
player  at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," cd collection in your pocket . 
this  i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift . 
use  i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful . 
memory  the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun . 
battery  plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad . 
software  the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with . 
 this is a powerful piece of equipment . 
 it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything . 
rip , quality  ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good . 
player  considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player . 
 before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," buy an extended warranty - you 'll need it ! 
 i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all . 
 but you might find my review useful , nonetheless . 
 i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago . 
 two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) . 
 i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs . 
 it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said . 
 moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it . 
 ( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . ) 
 if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered . 
 but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) . 
 so i 'm screwed . 
 but you do n't have to be . 
 if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty . 
 or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty . 
sound quality  it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," the best ipod alternative . 
 i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player . 
 i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums . 
 despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online . 
zen xtra  after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed . 
 i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty . 
battery  first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod . 
battery  it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted . 
 creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery . 
software  the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use . 
 point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest . 
playlist ,cd rip  you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player . 
transfer  and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy . 
 you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player . 
sound  the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise . 
earbud  i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well . 
earbud  they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department . 
equalizer  i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too . 
 there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will . 
 it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it . 
clip  however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off . 
 it happened to me once . 
 so now i keep it in my pocket . 
case  also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . 
 it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it . 
 that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," important zen information . 
player  this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues . 
 zen good points : 
storage  1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more . 
 2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous . 
stoppage  the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click . 
 flaws : 
software  1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? 
mediasource  mediasource did not recognize my tags ! 
 my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource . 
 i do n't think so . 
 btw , if you   are   ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information . 
eax  2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax . 
 after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player . 
 when i turned eax off the static disappeared . 
 when i turned eax back on the static was also not present . 
eax  creative are   the   sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static . 
 is eax faulty ?
 is my unit defective ? 
 was i just unlucky at that moment ? 
 was it a full moon that night ? 
 i have n't figured it out yet . 
mediasource  3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . 
 do not underestimate this in your purchase decision . 
 many reviewers refer to it as "" clunky "" or "" difficult "" - heed their warnings . 
 some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ; 
 i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution . 
folder structure  4 .the zen   stores   data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) . 
storage  in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) . 
 my goal of using it as a music player   and   data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake . 
stop button  5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! 
 you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button . 
manual  but this is   not documented   in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version . 
 to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it . 
usb recharge  6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . 
 if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx . 
mediasource  7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 
 it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ; 
 i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error . 
 creative provided e-mail support ; 
 i followed their advice but that failed , too . 
 i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine . 
 so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error . 
 however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution . 
 third party software to the rescue 
 after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems . 
 i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily . 
 this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( . 
notmad  m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! 
 notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ... 
 conclusion : 
 if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen . 
software  given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software . 
 and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ... 
 to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ; 
 i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ; 
 i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer . 
 the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ). 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," how did i get by without this ? 
 this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me . 
player  now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! 
memory  i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory . 
sound quality  the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! 
navigation  it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device . 
operate  i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive . 
 i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes . 
software  the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 
napster  one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software . 
 my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things . 
name  they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) . 
 whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) . 
 minor gripe . 
 i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," great memory , quality ? 
player  i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason . 
 in a quick summation , here is what i found . 
storage  + the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering . 
 i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 ! 
 it may have taken several years to fill this up . 
musicmatch software  + i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit 
screen  + screen was good , easy to read 
sound quality  + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great . 
software  - the software that came with it was tough to load . 
 i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded . 
battery top  - the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch . 
 not good if you 're taking this traveling . 
top  the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective ) 
cover  - the cover that came with it did n't fit very well 
flywheel  - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage . 
 i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break . 
construction  - this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," great product great price . 
 i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod . 
zen xtra  i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed . 
player ,sound quality  the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality . 
navigation  navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too . 
software  many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective . 
player  i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision . 
 i cannot recommend it enough ! ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," flimsy product . 
 i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery . 
construction  the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . 
 this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched . 
 i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd . 
construction  i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for . 
 if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality . 
 do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," the 3 ( ? ! ) month warranty should be a warning . 
 like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product . 
price  the price / performance looked just right . 
 when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff . 
 boy was i wrong . 
 reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it . 
 that 's been my experience . 
 if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty . 
 but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty . 
 now i know better . 
headphone jack  i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . 
 a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ? 
 so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back . 
 from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles . 
construction  i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy . 
 now let 's talk about the software . 
installation  like other reviewers , installation was hell . 
 subsequent behavior even worse . 
software  about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc . 
online help  after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all . 
player  in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered . 
 finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing . 
installation  to my amazement , even that process was error-prone . 
things  it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n't a clue why . 
 that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability . 
notmad software  i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement . 
 but that 's a moot point now . 
nomad  my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) . 
 my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod . 
 which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that . 
 be forewarned . 
 i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software . 
 now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," very bad company . 
creative product  i will never buy a creative product again . 
thing  i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing . 
 no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man . 
 also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac . 
 within months they stopped supporting the new mac os . 
 what kind of a company does that ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," great value & great sound ; 
 carry your entire collection ! 
 pros : 
sound ,power output  1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers . 
volume  with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) . 
player  the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . 
user interface  2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection . 
nomad explorer  3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player . 
nomad explorer  the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . 
usb 2.0  4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 
battery  5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . 
battery life  6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's . 
look  7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . 
player  i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine . 
mediasource  8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). 
 a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc. 
id3 tag  i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags . 
cd rip  b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive . 
sync  c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer . 
wake up  9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time . 
 i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning . 
play mode  10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter . 
pause  11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player 
storage  12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! 
 cons : 
plug and play  1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it . 
id3  2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information . 
 this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music . 
folder  3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files . 
 this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags . 
 the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files . 
fm ,voice recording  4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . 
accessory  5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing . 
 both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters . 
 a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary . 
case  6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed . 
 i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case . 
flip switch  7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch . 
 experience : 
 once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player . 
 this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) . 
 i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen . 
 also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates . 
 recommendations : 
 1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive . 
 2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one . 
 3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year . 
 4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. ) 
 5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .

 pros summary : 
sound , wake up ,play mode  great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes 
 cons summary : 
plug and play  not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording 
 bottom-line : 
storage  can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go . 
 my favorite is to play "" any track "" - am rediscovering my music ! 
wake up  also love waking up to music with attached speakers .

Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," headphone jack . 
 i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas . 
headphone jack  so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out . 
 i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty . 
 it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it . 
creative  nothing but hassle with this company . 
 what kind of product goes out within a month ? 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," those who do n't like it are ipod lovers and are in denial . 
 this thing does its job . 
 i 've compared and compared and compared . 
 it was either the 40gb ipod or this one . 
shuffle  i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com. 
 the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then . 
battery  replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 . 
 cons : 
cover  the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck . 
 i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out . 
weight  it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman . 
headphone  headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature . 
software  the software sucks . 
 it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes . 
feature  also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate . 
 you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," not what i 'd hoped . 
 i was prepared to love it . 
headphone jack  i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up . 
 now i have to return it and rip all my music again . 
 good thing i got a replacement plan . 
 wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs . 
 reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better . 
 i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two . 
 maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one . 
size  kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that . 
software  software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad . 
player  i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive . 
 i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at . 
 makes me use it much less than i otherwise would . 
 looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it . 
player  i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," not durable enough for this road warrior . 
product , sound , use  i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood . 
durability  i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero . 
hard drive  always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped . 
 tech support could n't figure it out and gave up . 
player  i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," the best jukebox mp3 player , hands-down . 
 i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 . 
player  the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market . 
 the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software . 
software  fact is , it could n't be easier to use . 
 these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player . 
 assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra . 
sound quality  sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products . 
sound  even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback . 
menu  the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily . 
battery  the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter . 
player  connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! 
 get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library . 
 awesome feature . 
usb 2.0  usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast . 
folder  minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable . 
 that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually . 
folder  the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name . 
 not a big hassle as many would have you think . 
id3 tag  2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . "" 
 i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only . 
 when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra . 
 take the time to fill in those tags ! 
nomad explorer  3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software . 
nomad explorer  in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . 
 so what are you waiting for ? 
 get one now ! 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," not worth the trouble . 
 i received this as a gift for christmas . 
player  my first impression was positive . 
 after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings . 
eax  first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes . 
 at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not . 
 it was just a problem with the player . 
menue  second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed . 
scroll  the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well . 
button  the general button placement is not very user friendly . 
 this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis . 
case  third , the poor design continues with the case . 
 the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it . 
 it also covers over the power jack when closed . 
 after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work . 
 i bought an ipod and am very happy with it . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," creative nomad zen xtra 40 gb . 
price  overall , a good buy for the price . 
navigation  easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton . 
battery life  my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . 
battery  there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! 
 at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + . 
 i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight . 
 no difference . 
 if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought . 
lock up  i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times . 
 the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it . 
 that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty . 
construction  the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case . 
case  at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice . 
storage  pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery 
 cons : 
battery life ,lock up ,replacement battery  battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive 
 note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) . 
 this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," a possible discontinued item ? 
 what 's going on creative labs ? 
 is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ? 
 hmmmmm .... 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," hard disk mp3 players . 
 if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later . 
 if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet . 
 all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while . 
 if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you . 
 ipod clearly has the most buzz . 
 great design and looks cool . 
 most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons . 
 it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used . 
 some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface . 
 everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction . 
 ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem . 
 however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization . 
 synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized . 
 reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . 
 reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item . 
 after that it seems like you 're on your own . 
 ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it "" unnecessary "" and "" so 20th century "" . 
construction ,scroll wheel ,headphone jack  creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack . 
 construction quality is a difficult item . 
 the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced . 
build  what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . 
 drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) . 
 many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen . 
support  feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products . 
scroll wheel  the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device . 
software  the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers . 
headphone jack  enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . 
folder  the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best . 
sound quality  reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . 
 the zen has no stop button . 
 veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want . 
 the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk . 
 it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing . 
 if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about . 
 karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity . 
 usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback . 
 repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist 
 - you just have to buy a new player . 
 perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories . 
 like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device . 
 it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates . 
 the karma does have a stop button . 
 there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp . 
 those that have it like it . 
 the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) . 
 otherwise feedback seems to be good . 
 no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories . 
 no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one . 
 none of these are perfect . 
 if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you . 
 accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less . 
 if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 . 
 if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," good for a little while , but .. . 
price  sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod . 
quality  but with a low price , comes lower quality . 
sound quality ,battery life  our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price . 
player  the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap . 
 it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks . 
headphone jack  i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out . 
 i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked . 
 so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect . 
 wow . 
 do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week . 
 if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod . 
 if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund . 
 i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," software problem . 
player  i bought the player this week and i like it by far . 
 this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative . 
 here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one . 
 pro : 1 . 
battery  removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years . 
 my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up . 
 his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now . 
 2 . 
value  value : comparing data storage with price . 
 3 . 
 size and style : 
appearance  the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) . 
size  the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . ) 
 4 . 
use  easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
 con : 
mediasource  the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) . 
 a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here . 
software  in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place . 
 however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems . 
 i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem . 
 ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more ) 
 now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource . 
size  in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws . 
 alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player . 
 well to say , i had a very bad history with players . 
 one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 . 
 if you are planning to buy that player , do not ! 
 that player is a complete piece of sh  . 
 i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap . 
 now getting back to this . 
 i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks . 
 now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws . 
 cons : 
 1 . 
display  the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly 
 2 . 
storage  huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you . 
 ( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) . 
 and those songs mostly are 320 kbps. 
 3 . 
sound  the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack . 
 4 . 
eax  with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it . 
 5 . 
software  if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs . 
 you can also search for your song , which is good . 
 6 . 
software  i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome . 
 you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem . 
 and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem . 
 7 . 
battery  battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours . 
 8 . 
player  when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off . 
 9 . 
manage  you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed . 
interface  you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical . 
alarm  there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good . 
clock  there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful . 
 10 . 
firmware  the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any . 
 11 . 
music  the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption . 
 cons : 
 1 . 
battery life  the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life . 
 the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 . 
 5 hours max. i did it like this 
 eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours 
 2 . 
panel  the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said . 
 3 . 
transfer  you need the software to actually transfer files 
 4 . 
player  the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings . 
lock up  also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying . 
 ( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points ) 
 well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," easy to use , massive storage space , sounds great . 
price  and also , it 's priced very affordably . 
storage  with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more . 
 a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room . 
 having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there . 
 having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage . 
software  the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted . 
sound  the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones . 
 on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good . 
sound setting  sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference . 
accessing file  accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive . 
battery  possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery . 
battery  since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) . 
value  try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface . 
 i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad . 
 the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me . 
color  i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy . 
 the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage . 
 my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," good for the price . 
player  i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it . 
 the pros : 
price  price ! 
 almost half what an ipod would cost you ! 
 i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me . 
sound quality  sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization . 
earphone  yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway . 
interface  i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough . 
playlist  i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! 
 cons . 
software  creative software stinks . 
 it 's horrible . 
 redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more ! 
cover  the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," great player . 
player  have had the player since xmass and love it ! 
 pros : 
sound ,battery life , firmware  great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price . 
 cons : 
warranty ,freeze up ,navigation wheel  short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel . 
 neutral : 
 i did n't even try the included software . 
 i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .

Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," i do n't see what everyone 's problem is - i love this player . 
player  this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod . 
price  for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some . 
 here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail : 
 look / design : 
size  the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods . 
 it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods . 
build  it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it . 
control  i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least . 
scroll wheel  the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . 
screen  the screen 's large and easily read . 
pop-up face  the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . 
sound  sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod . 
 from what i 've heard it 's at least equal . 
 like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels . 
 there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far . 
interface  interface - practically seamless . 
 songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver . 
id3 tag  yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy . 
 it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better . 
 you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search . 
playlist  playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options . 
balance  the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . 
 software : 
mediasource  as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better . 
mediasource  it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files . 
id3 tag  the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well . 
software  it was no problem for me to use their software . 
 some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive . 
 the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience . 
player  overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . 
 so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer . 
equipment  please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," does not function correctly , unhelpful customer service . 
player  do n't buy this player . 
 i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless . 
player  unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . "" 
 it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do . 
player  do n't buy this player . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," why can 't it be rated zero stars ? 
product  do not buy this product -- 
player  i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . 
 nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke . 
software  the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," o man , not cool . 
 ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one . 
player  honestly , i love this player . 
 one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one . 
sound ,battery life  once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life . 
 ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me . 
hard drive  however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once . 
 therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) . 
 if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty . 
 if it does , ill give up . 
 basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed . 
 thats it . 
 i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back . 
 the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now . 
 basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 . 
 you know why ? 
break  because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible . 
 now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind . 
 i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . . 
 honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players . 
 this is all i have to say . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," what a junk . 
player  what a junk . 
freeze  every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes . 
 the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode . 
 so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home . 
 after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," you will be very disappointed with this product . 
 the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months . 
 those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it . 
 the price is way below an ipod of the same size . 
 the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod . 
sound quality  the sound quality is very good . 
control  the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . 
 because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it . 
 for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection . 
storage  having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . 
 they fall in love with the product . 
 and then it breaks . 
 usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires . 
headphone jack  typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . 
 the nomad is sent back to creative labs . 
 they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it . 
 in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it . 
 like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it . 
 if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two . 
design  i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . 
headphone jack  the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . 
front cover  the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . 
headphone jack  the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire . 
 even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty . 
 and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase . 
 this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it . 
 so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad . 
 you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back . 
 you will have a very expensive paperweight . 
 there are not a lot of good options out there . 
 most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery . 
 my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops . 
 maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again . 
 maybe more competitors will bring out similar products . 
 and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod . 
 whatever you do , do n't buy this product . 
 you will be sorry if you do . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," piece of junk . 
 i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now . 
 i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month . 
lock up  the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now . 
 it says i have a harddisk problem . 
 and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty . 
 it worked good for a while . 
 it did lock up on me a couple of times . 
 and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk . 
"
Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB," nomads are wonderful , but be carefull ! 
 i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ). 
 unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it . 
 the batteries would not charge . 
 so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model . 
hard drive  in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . 
 it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem . 
 so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty ! 
 it always pays off . 
 hope i 've been of some help . 
"
Diaper Champ,"
Works  Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.
 Can't complain at all!
"
Diaper Champ,"
Diaper Champ  So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.
diapers  It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
 I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
odors  I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
"
Diaper Champ,"
 We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.
 We hated that thing!
 The ""new"" design still needs lots of improvement!
 The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
 And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
 As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
 We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
Diaper Champ  The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
bags  There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
bag  We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
 There is also no trick to it.
 No spinning it or anyhting!
 Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!
smelling  Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
diaper  We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
product  It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
"
Diaper Champ,"
 In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
refills  I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
 I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.
diaper wipes  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
Diaper Champ  In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.
odor  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
 I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.
Diaper Genie  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
"
Diaper Champ,"
Diaper Champ  It's far better than all others on the market.
convenient  it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
"
Diaper Champ,"
use  There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
 Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
"
Diaper Champ,"
 My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product.
 We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
 We liked it because:
garbage bags  1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
 2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic.
product  3. It never smelled - at all.
 Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
 I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
 I just know it really worked for us.
container  The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
 We graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump.
"
Diaper Champ,"
 WRONG!
size  Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
size  It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
 Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage.
"
Diaper Champ,"
 A MUST HAVE!
product  This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
 The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
 ANY Garbage bags will fit.
Diaper Genie  The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
work  This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.
 FANTASTIC!
"
Diaper Champ,"
item  I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
"
Diaper Champ,"
fit  My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
hole  The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
 I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
"
Diaper Champ,"
odors  This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
"
Diaper Champ,"
 We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
"
Diaper Champ,"
 We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
 and what a Godsend!
fill , unload  It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?
diaper  It also holds a lot more diapers.
size  look at the size of it!
 Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.
odor  I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
 unlike the Diaper Genie!
diaper  I highly recommend this!
"
Diaper Champ,"
diaper genie  For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
 I would not recommend buying that one.
 My second child I didn't get any.
 Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
Diaper Champ  I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.
 I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
replacement  I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
use  It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
 I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
"
Diaper Champ,"
 My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie.
 Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.
Champ  The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
 Presto!
 Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
function  But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
diaper  (I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.
 A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
 Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
 Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.
"
Diaper Champ,"
diaper pail  I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
 I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.
 It was such a pain to use.
 We all hated it.
use  The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
refills  And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
 It takes regular trash bags.
 I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
odor  And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
diaper champ  If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
"
Diaper Champ,"
 It was a PAIN.
 Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
 it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
ITEM  THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
 For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
 I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
"
Diaper Champ,"
Diaper Champ  Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
holds  It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
use  It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
empty  It's also easy to empty out.
 Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
garbage bags  And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
diaper pail  Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!
"
Diaper Champ,"
 My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
 As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
 She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).
pail  Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
Opening  Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
refills  Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
 If you have a really sensitive nose, I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ, once you have to open it to empty out the full bag, you're quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor, and scented bags help with that.
plunger  As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the ""plunger"" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
emptying  But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
gift  This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
 I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
 It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
Champ  Go for the Champ.
 It lives up to its name.
"
Diaper Champ,"
product  I love this product!
dispose  With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
trash bags  Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
refills  No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
"
Diaper Champ,"
product  and we still LOVE it!
 We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
 We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
 Here's what we love about this pail.
holds   holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
trash bags  (we wrap them nice and tight)  we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
odor   holds the odor in nicely!
use  (every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol)  easy one-hand use  impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.
 Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
Diaper Champ  We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.
"
Diaper Champ,"
holds  It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
trash bags  I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special ""diaper"" trash bags necessary.
opening  The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
works  It works with a minimum of fuss.
"
Diaper Champ,"
diaper champ  The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that.
 I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
purchases  This is one of the best purchases we made.
 The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
product  Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
champ  Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
champ  There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
"
Diaper Champ,"
pail  I love this pail!
smell ,ease of use ,garbage bags  No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!
 I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
 4 months later.
 OK.
 I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
 Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
diaper pail  Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell.
diaper pail  I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.
"
Diaper Champ,"
diaper pail  I think it's great.
diaper pail  I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
diaper pail  It definitely keeps the smell out.
"
Diaper Champ,"
odor  But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
odor  First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
 Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
odor  But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.
 Every time!
"
Diaper Champ,"
diaper champ  The diaper champ is the best!
 Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.
 I can honestly speak to its worth!
Champ  I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.
use  1) The champ is easy to use.
 One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
 You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
 For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.
Champ  With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
dispose  It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
 The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
store bags  2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
Champ  You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
 You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
 Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
 This will never be a problem with the Champ.
 Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
 The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
Champ  3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.
Champ  The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
 I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
 If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
other pail  The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
Champ  Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.
 The positives outway the negatives.
 There probably isn't a pail out on the market that doesn't get smelly after a while.
Champ  Let the Champ win you over!
"
Diaper Champ,"
 My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
 dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
 I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag.
odor  No need for deodorizers.
empty  I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
noise  even did while daughter sleep and no noise!
smell  I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
space  This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
"
Diaper Champ,"
 When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
 We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.
top loader  We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
Diaper Champ  We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
diaper wipes  We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
 This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
 I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
Diaper Champ  But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.
"
Diaper Champ,"
diapers  It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
smell  At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
 It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
 I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
 The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.

 She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
Diaper Champ  Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
operate  It is mindless to operate.
 It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
Diaper Champ  It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
clean  And it is very easy to clean.
diaper  I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
 I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
 I'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in.
 I am very pleased with our choice.
"
Diaper Champ,"
diaper pail  This is a great diaper pail.
use  There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
refills  (You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
diaper pail  And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
"
Diaper Champ,"
 We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
Champ  and we definitely prefer our Champ!
cost effective  Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
 Only problem.
unit  it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.
pluger  The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
"
Diaper Champ,"
item  I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
diapers  For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
product  The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.  
Diaper Champ  All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
"
Diaper Champ,"
diaper champ  I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
works  It works great.
smell  I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
works  I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
 It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.
 The reviews were definitely right.
"
Diaper Champ,"
Diaper Champ  We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
odors  It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
install  It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
 As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
 For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
 Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
wipes  We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).
open  It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
use  Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)
"
Diaper Champ,"
 I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail. 
Diaper Champ  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
costly   Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
PRODUCT  THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
ODOR  I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!
odor  No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
Diaper Champ  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
 For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:  
 1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
 I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.
 For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! 
 Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.
CLEAN  2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!
 Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! 
 All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
WORKS  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
Diaper Champ  Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
 In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.
 Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!  
product  All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
"
Diaper Champ,"
diaper champ  I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
pail  The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
pail  I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
"
Diaper Champ,"
  We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.  
ODEROUS  That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
 Even when empty!
 So, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.  
semelled  It still smelled.
 So then I used straight bleach.  
 That seemed to work -- for about 3 days.  
smell  Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
 However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS - 
bags  Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
height  The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
stable  Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
open  CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
diapers  Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
Diapers  Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first. 
 My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
  (Being a diaper pail, I'd prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary.)     
"
Diaper Champ,"
product  I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
open  The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
pull  The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.
open  I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
 That would be my only complaint.
"
Diaper Champ,"
product  This is a GREAT product!
Diapers  I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
 Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
 I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula. 
 I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, ""Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?""  
works  The Champ works great.
garbage bags  We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
odor  We've never experienced odor from the pail.
assemble , fit  It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.
filp  I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
 Highly recommended!!!
 Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
"
Diaper Champ,"
unit  Excellent diaper disposal unit.
 I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).
product  I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
investment  A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
"
Diaper Champ,"
Diaper Champ  Diaper Champ is great.
 But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.  
Diaper Champ  So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
"
Diaper Champ,"
Diaper Champ  Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
works  It works easily with one hand, which is important.
trash bag  Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
Diaper Champ  While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
"
Diaper Champ,"
seal  Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
wipes  Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston.
 Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly. 
diaper Dekor  I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
 Much more hands off and takes any size diapers.
stinky  Also much less stinky.
diaper champ  Don't buy the diaper champ.
 You will be sorry after a few months.     
"
Diaper Champ,"
 So far so good.
pail  I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
 I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?  
 Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.
product  I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
"
Diaper Champ,"
 Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all. 
pail.  This one is really great.
Champ  I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
 I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted. 
Champ  Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
 We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month. 
refills  The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!
work  We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
bags  We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
change  We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
 Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!
"
Diaper Champ,"
 Don't listen to the bad reviews!
diaper pail  This is really a nice diaper pail.
diaper pail  I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
diaper pail  In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
 Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.  
diaper pail  Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
Diaper Champ  I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
refills  1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
work  We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
refills  We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
operated  2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.
safer  So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
 With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.  
Diaper Champ  The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
 He thinks it is magic when the diaper ""disappears"".  
change  3.  Bags are easy to change.
 Pop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.  
 To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.  
 It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.  
 It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!
smell  Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
 Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!  
smells  To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.
 Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
Works  Works great!!!!
price  5.  The price is right.
 At $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddler's room.

Hitachi router,"
performed  I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
 Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
adjustment  The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
 I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
collet  The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
use  Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
 I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
"
Hitachi router,"
 I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table.
price  From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
 I have a mid-size plunge router already, (the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router, read the MANY reviews) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.
"
Hitachi router,"
 I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
power  But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
 At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.
power  The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
bigger  However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
plunge  Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
price  The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
use  Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
"
Hitachi router,"
 I looked at this router and bought a Makita.
looked  The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
 I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
worth  If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
"
Hitachi router,"
pretty  It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
smooth ,track record  But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.
adjustment  I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
 Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
 Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
costs  So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
 Happy woodworking!!
"
Hitachi router,"
router  Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
weight  It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.
 Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
 Hitachi includes a 1/2"" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
 I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.
 And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.
M12V  In my table the M12V has been a real champ.
 I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
heavy  The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
controls  With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
 Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2"" shank, 1/2"" diameter, 1"" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4"" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a ""13 mm"" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
 Not included are: - 3/8"" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
 The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
 Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
 This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
motor  Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
weight  Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4"" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
 Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
"
Hitachi router,"
router  This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
solidity  Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.
start  The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
heavy  It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
guide  The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
 I used this router to plow out 3"" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.
speed  This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
 The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
adjustment  The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
collet  The only complaint I have is that the 1/4"" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4"" bits.
 I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.
collet  The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.
 However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
machine  This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
router  Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
"
Hitachi router,"
 I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
 The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
adjustment  I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
speed  The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
guide  The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
accessible  The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
heavy  It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.
 Those are the good points.
 There are a few points of contention which I have.
 The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a ""ball park"" measure.
plunge  The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
 This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
instructions  The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
fit  Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
 I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
price  Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.
"
Hitachi router,"
money  This is an excellent router for the money.
 I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
plunge  The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
springs  I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
money  Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
"
Hitachi router,"
router  I must have gotten a good one.
adjustment  I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4"" sleeve yet) .
 Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
 I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
 I have many others in the past.
Hitachi  I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
vibration  No vibration!
plunging  Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.
router  It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
 Why do people spend all that money on accessories to ""raise and lower "" the router in a table??? A waste of money.
shaft  It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
balance  Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.
start  The soft start is nice.
price  The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
price  The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
cheap  Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
 I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect!
 I think I'll go rout something...
"
Hitachi router,"
 Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
 I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
 Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.
price  Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
operate  UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
switch  Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
heavy  It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
 I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
 Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
 LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
spring  1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
spring  Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
sawdust  I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
sawdust  Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
 2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
 Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
 I do woodworking as a serious hobby.
use  For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
price  Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
"
Hitachi router,"
 My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
 The owner had three routers - all M12's.
 This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router.
 In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
M12  After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
router  On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
use   I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
slop  The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
 Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.
big  If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..

 This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4"" fixed base router.
 She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
router  What an upgrade!!!
starts  I have only used it with the 1/4"" collet and a 1/2"" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.
adjustment  The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
use , vibration  The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
price  Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
router  I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
 Now I need to get some 1/2"" bits...
"
Hitachi router,"
router  I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
stable  I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.
fence  It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
controls  Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
simple  I prefer things that are simple.
 I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
 I now  have it as a permenant fixture  in my router table.
power  The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
guide  I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
 It will take 31/2 inchers now.
springs  I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
adjustments  I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
wrench  I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.
system  Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.
 I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
"
Hitachi router,"
router  I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.
quiet  It is quiet and has plenty of power.
stability  I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
plunging  That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
shafts  Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
shafts  After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
plunge  I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
plunging  If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
plunging  If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.
"
Hitachi router,"
performance  I love the performance and features of this router.
money  For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
quiet  It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
 I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
 I've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well.
plunging  Smooth plunging mechanism.
fence  The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
 The only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits.
grip  It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
router  Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
"
Hitachi router,"
router  I purchased two of these beauties.
 For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
router  I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
router  One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
 My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
collets  The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
 I have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.
collets  They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
money  I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
setup  The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
 I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
 As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
router  I would however highly recommend the m12v router !
"
Hitachi router,"
Hitachi M12V  I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
 This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
 I mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift.
operation  The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.
router  Its well made and user friendly.
router  You'll love it!
"
Hitachi router,"
 This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
router  It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
 I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
start  This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.
router  I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
power  It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.
price  For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.
router  You just can't go wrong with this one!
router  Enjoy.
"
Hitachi router,"
price  This is an excellent router for the price.
 This is my second one.
router  The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
"
Hitachi router,"
tool  This is a well-made and powerful tool.
"
Hitachi router,"
 At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
price  I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
 I bought it!
 I have 5 routers, I use them all!
 I make furniture and cabinetry.
 I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
 Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.
M12V  The M12V has been great.
adjustment  The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
bog  The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
 The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.
quite  What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
 Good luck and cut wood!!!!
"
Hitachi router,"
router  This router was a huge disapointment.
adjustment  The depth adjustment was sloppy.
control  The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
control  It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
control  My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
heft  I did like the heft of the machine.
stable  It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
router  I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
router  All in all, not very good.
"
Hitachi router,"
price  I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.
 I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
 Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
 The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
power  The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
adjust  The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
adjustment  The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
price  I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
"
Hitachi router,"
 I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
 If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
router  The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
machine  I recently had to run a 3/4"" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.
router  I could take 1/2"" passes and it still didn't skip a beat.
 As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
Hitachi  I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
price  Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
router  I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
router  It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
"
Hitachi router,"
 I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
starts  The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
router  I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
router  If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
router  I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
"
Hitachi router,"
power  I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
bog  It doesn't bog down under load.
Cuts  Cuts are easy and smooth.
works  I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
adjustment  The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
adjustment  I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.
wrench  Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
latch  The sliding latch is does not stay in place.
 It is almost all you can do to change bits with two hands (you need three).
 I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
router  Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.
price  I really liked the price...
"
Hitachi router,"
 I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
 It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
 Because of this I have removed the handles.
control  I like the speed control.
 It works well with the larger bits.
 (I prefer 1/2 inch bits).
power  It has plenty of power.
adustment knob  The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.
Router Razier  Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
 After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
 The one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult.
wrench  I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the ""sliding wrench"" which comes on the router.
router  All in all I am pleased with the router.
power  The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
"
Hitachi router,"
 I have owned this router for nearly five years.
 Until recently it was my only router.
 Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
heavy  It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.
control  Recenly the variable speed control went out.
control  It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
 The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.
 I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
 I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
plunge  The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
router  Overall it is a great value.
price  For the price I don't think you can beat it.
"
Hitachi router,"
tool  This is a fantastic tool to use.
heavy  Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
product  This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
"
Hitachi router,"
 I have purchased & used 2 of these routers in the past 3 years.
last  They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.
safety  My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
 First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
 Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
 I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
router  When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.
 But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.
 Then, without warning, it took off again.
safety  Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
 I use these routers under a table.
 Outside of needing an extension for half inch bits, which is a problem for most machines of this type.
depth  Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
depths  You must keep double checking depths.
machine  But, for the money it is a good machine.
duration  Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
control  The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
 I am now waiting for this one to stop.
router  For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
equipment  For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
safety  If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
"
Linksys Router,"
router  This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it. 
setup , installation   It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up. 
install  By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do. 
works   It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is. 
 That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual. 
router   It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house. 
router   There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it. 
 I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
 apart on their reviews, they are talking about installation problems and what not. 
setup , ROUTER   Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!     
"
Linksys Router,"
install , router   It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.  
 If you have good networking knowledge, you'll abandon the wizard, use the 100-page online manual, and be fine.   
 I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.  
Wizard   The Wizard is particularly sinister. 
wizard  It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC. 
 After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is ""admin""?) it refused to go past step 8. 
 These are just some of the pathetic examples.  
 They!
 provide no printed manual. 
 I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website. 
 Stupid me. 
 It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD. 
 But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard? 
 No, of course not. 
 You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the ""User Guide"" tab which loads the manual.  
setup   The box proudly displays ""SecureEasySetup (TM)"" ""Wireless Made Simple"" ""One Touch Setup Button"" ""Easy Start"" ""Easy Security"" ""Easy Everyday""   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial. 
 It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.  
 I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.

Linksys Router,"
 If you're buying this product and operate on a Mac platform, ditch the CD and go directly to live assistance on the Linksys website.     
router   I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself. 
 I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison. 
 (The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)
configuration   HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup. 
 I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support. 
 But wh!
 en I opened the box I found little more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed CD before plugging in the router.  
CD   Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac. 
 (Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
 ) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips. 
user manual   I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless. 
technical support   The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac. 
 It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something. 
 But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS), where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it. 
instruction   I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
 meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.  
 The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant. 
documentation   What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!
 ! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance. 
 I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions  somewhere.
setup     I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable. 
product   But the product iself is great.  
 If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product. 
router   Once you set it up, it's great. 
well-priced   And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting. 
 Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.

Linksys Router,"
 For an item that is not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I went to buy it, the fact that ... has these in and out of stock, and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation.  
 What about hookup and use? 
performance   Another 5 star performance. 
 Having never hooked up a wireless network before, I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit, and used their included CD. 
 They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right. 
 Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, I decided to do it that way right out of the box. 
 I'm glad I did. 
CD   This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time. 
 Shutting off what they t!
 ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install. 
 Not even one glitch. 
 The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.  
 I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install. 
 Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house. 
 No Wires !  
speed   Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room. 
 When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps. 
 Let's get a perspective here. 
 A standard modem works at 56K tops. 
works   This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte. 
 Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte. 
 So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem. 
running   I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
 nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed. 
 I know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card. 
 What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.  
Broadband   Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies. 
 As soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.  
 Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast. 
 The operating system is Windows XP. 
Installation   Installation was as near automatic as can be. 
 They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP. 
equipment  All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment. 
 Follow the directions exactly. 
 It is easy. 
 Hope this helps.

WEP encryption   I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA. 
 Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever. 
connectivity   Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.  
firmware update   New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration. 
configuration   All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network. 
router   Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.  
installation   Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router. 
setting up   You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.  
costlier   Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco. 
 But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending. 
 Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !
"
Linksys Router,"
 It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require  not  following the instructions.  
 I had an old wired Linksys router.  
 The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it. 
 There was a big sticker inside the box saying ""RUN CD FIRST - DO NOT DISCONNECT YOUR CURRENT ROUTER"".  
 And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.  
 So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.  
instructions   There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.  
 If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.  
 But since I do have a little experience, I simply disconnected my old router and put in the new one.  
 I do know what wires go !
 to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc. 
 So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.  
security   The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.  
 There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.  
 If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.  
 But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.  
works   The router works fine for both wired and wireless.  
connect   I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.  
connect   Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.  
 But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.  
 I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
CD   little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.  
router   I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.

 Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product. 
enterprise piece   This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment. 
 You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line. 
 People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves. 
 They need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money. 
 That aside, this is not that bad of a product. 
router   I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it. 
 With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem. 
 If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers. 
 P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
 all kinds.  
 On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux. 
 Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware. 
 So, if you type in ""Linksys firmware"" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux). 
 The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.  However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5. 
hardware version   The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half. 
 Simply put, the hardware is just too small to run Linux, which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54G's firmware.  
 However, if you are not a tech person and!
WRT54G   just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it. 
 Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself. 
 Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption. 
 All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.  
 If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router. 
 They have the large amounts of RAM and still run Linux. 
WRT54G   I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.

 I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.  
 The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the ""Speedbooster"" version.  
 After asking around, I found out I didn't.  
 The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.  
CD   I tried the CD setup program without any luck.  
 Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.  
 Nope.  
 That didn't work either.    
 A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.  
 No hold time.  
1-800   Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem. 
CD   Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.  
 I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
 ite:  www.linksys.com/connect  I clicked on NetSet Assistant and let it do it's thing.  
 I followed the prompts to disconnect and reconnect Ethernet cables, and then rebooted.  
 Problem solved.  
 As far as WEP configuration... make your adjustments after you've set up the router using the default setup.  
product   It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.  
router   This is my fourth Linksys product and, aside from the rough start, I'm very satisfied with this router.

 I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs. 
router   This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE. 
 For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.

 I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.  
 A great service which I highly recommend. 
 I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.  
 I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.  
 I wrongly thought that it was the router.  
 Fool that I was! 
 After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.
 ,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.  
WRT54G   I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!! 
 Be sure to call your ISP with the modem's MAC address to get online.  
 YOU WON'T get connected otherwise. 
 My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.  
 Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.

 I got this for my aunt who pretty much knows nothing about computers. 
set up   It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems. 
 Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing. 
instructions   there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth. 
installation   And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow. 
product   A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years. 
 I'd also recommend wireless products made by Belkin. 
 i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.

security , speed   I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed. 
router   However, this product performed well below my expectation.  
stream , copy large files   The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.  
 I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.  
 Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang. 
 This behavior (hanging) also occurs when I transfer large files between my PCs.  
design   After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).  
 If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.

 However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.

 I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed. 
works   So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.  
 My next project will be to try out sveasoft firmware to increase this unit capabilities and wireless range.

 I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking. 
 Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.  
 The cheap router I used to own had very minimal feature in the configurations menu and less security options then the Linksys WRT54G. 
 But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time. 
 I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.   router   I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for. 
 You won't regret it. 
setup   The setup was very easy. 
instructions   Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time. 
design , anteanna   The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.   
 No more connection!
signals   drops and strong signals even from the backyard. 
security , configuration menu  The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.  
Linksys   Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys. 
quality   The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.

 I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.  
 See my other reviews for the details.  
Broadcom hardware   I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.  
 This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.  
 I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.

 I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work. 
CD   The installation software CD crashed repeatedly. 
 Thinking the CD was faulty, I went to the Linksys website, hoping to simply download the setup program, but it's not available. 
connection   I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.   
 I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so. 
 Very disappointing.

wizard   I couldn't get the install wizard to work.  
instructions   However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.  
install   It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.  
 If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).  
 If buying for home office or small business this is a must.  
 For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.  
 If you need convincing on the security side, read Wireless Hacks, (this is a book of excellent tips, not just security), published by O'Reilly.  
wizard  Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.

 My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service. 
Linksys   While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.  
install   The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process. 
 I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6. 
 I also had to do this with the old router.  
 I used Linksys technical support several times. 
support   Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.

 Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.  
works , range   It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.  
Compatibility   Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with  anyone's  mixed mode).
 Then this is the way to go.

Linksys Router,"
Setup   Setup in XP was instant and intuitive. 
 However, your PC cards should also be Linksys ""g"" rated, as interoperability has been a problem on some ""b"" cards. 
pipeline   The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients. 
 Therefore, if you have a really robust connection (like a T3), this will help. 
 If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable. 
quality , tech support   Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.

 This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards. 
installation   My experience with installation was quite good.  
installation   I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).  
wizard   The card basically installed itself and the ""install wizard"" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).  
setup , documentation   The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.  
 The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.  
 Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
 running the installation wizard again.  
set up   I haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.  
documentation   The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.  
router , signal strength   I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners, seldom falling below the ""very good"" range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router.  
transmission speed   The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.  
backward   I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the ""mixed mode"" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.

 I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem. 
router   As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market. 
 If you want ""the newest gadget"" get the one with speedbooster. 
use , features   I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.   
router   All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one. 
 Expect about 10MBps and not more though!

product   This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year.

 This concept seems to be unusual. 
 Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device. 
 They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5. 
 They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time. 
 Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.  
 There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices. 
 Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done. 
 If it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue, explain it to us so we don't have to theorize on the motives.  
 In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
 uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections). 
 Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?

product , desktop card   This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.

Linksys   My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.

Linksys Router,"
 First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.  
 Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR. 
 You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.  
 Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought. 
documentation   Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.  
 What is really needed with these are plug-ins, (ever present software controls) standard from the operating system, (OS) (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.
 ) that use some type of connect standard where the OS does all the work.  
 It's not here yet!  
 Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.  
 The reason is simple, one word, and ""security"".  
 The average Windows based computer, can exist on an unprote!
 cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it. 
 They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.  
 In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.  
 It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.  
 Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.  
 You'll have to reinstall everything you put on, from the day you first turned it on.  
 Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.  
 What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?  
 For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.  
 A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.  
 Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
 from the cable modem you are using.  
 Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.  
 In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.  
 Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.  
 Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware. 
 This is what is commonly called a firewall. 
 You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.  
 Here is where many typical problems begin.  
 Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.  
 You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.  
 These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
 online games, or downloading files from sites with different security levels.  
 With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, ""the wireless connection"".  
 Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.  
 Computer novices should have a computer savvy person install, and set-up their router.  
 You are really the ones that need this the most.  
 Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.  
 Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.  
 Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?  
Linksys   Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.  
 Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.  
 I'm tr!
reliability   ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.  
 You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.  
model   This model appears to be especially good.  
 Why the four-port wireless model you ask? 
 You may only have one computer.  
 True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.  
 Still, if you think there may be more computers in the future, and there is a need for a multi-port network.  
 If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
 Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.   What about the wireless capability, you ask.  
 Well, if your network has or will have, computers in other rooms, you may not want to wire your house for Ethernet. 
 This is especially true if you don't need the!
 speed of a wired connection.  
 Don't worry though, the primary computer located by the Linksys, can be connected by wire, this makes for a solid, and fast connection to the Net.  
 My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.  
 Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router. 
 As said before, you may get some conflicts.  
 The other issue is how secure do you want it.  
 You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.  
 Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.  
 Another thing you may do are the many file transfers needed to playing network games.  Some settings allow you to play, but not host a game, others won't even let  you connect to play.  
 It may take several attempts, and reading a lot of FAQs or network help sites to fix some of these issues. 
 However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!
 less secure.  
 You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.  
 Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers. 
 They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.  
 It is a good place for new users, who want to feel safe, and they do provide a good measure of safety, but they are not the total answer.  
 Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.   Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security. 
 The purchase of a router is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself these days.

 I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago. 
 It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home. 
 To be honest I got it just to link up my Xbox (attached to a WET11 wireless ethernet bridge)to my cable modem (ISP Comcast), so I could get rid of the 70 feet of ethernet cable that ran down the hall. 
 Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it . 
setup   The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge. 
set up   To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins. 
 Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace. 
 Nor did I need any settings from my ISP. 
setup software   The setup software did everything. 
 This is my first foray in!
 to the wrld of wireless and it couldn't have gone better. 
connection+3]  My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable. 
 My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G. 
router   In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router. 
 There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem. 
 Great items !

 After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.  
 Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up. 
instant setup   The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually.

 At first I was going to give it a really bad review.

 I'm going to be moving soon. 
 One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection. 
 Got the Linksys after reading some reviews. 
software   Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. 
 But everything worked out for the best.  
 After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.

Tivo  The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.

logging   (...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging. 
 And provides near zero-statistics. 
 SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing. 
 This is universal across every brand I've worked with. 
 If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it. 
 Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.  
 I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations). 
 Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.  
 BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID. 
 SSID are like filenames in Windows. 
 When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID. 
 If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
 ID on their router.  
 MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic. 
 MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router. 
 You don't have to monkey with the PC config. 
 Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.  
 Best practice is learn how to setup encryption. 
 WEP encryption is weak but most computer people couldn't figure out how to break it. 
 WPA is best. 
 Problem is sometimes you can't get a visiting laptop to work with certain encryption. 
 Getting Apple/Macs was historically a pain, but they've all improved interoperability now. 
 Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.

Linksys Router,"
working   Absolutely no problems with this router. 
instructions   I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions. 
customer support   A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.  
 I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.  
Speed   Speed is not a problem.      
 I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG! 
 I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour! 
works   After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine. 
 If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it! 
Linksys   As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.     
"
Linksys Router,"
setup   Getting the router setup in a ""vanilla"" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
"
Linksys Router,"
 First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.  For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever. 
 However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me). 
 As I'd just purchased a new computer with a Wireless G adapter, I figured I'd upgrade the router as well and set it up as it's supposed to be.  
 I first purchased the Wireless G with Speedbooster. 
 Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions. 
 Quite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware. 
 The documentation was just horrible. 
 When you open the package the first thing you see is ""Run CD first"". 
 So I run the CD, and get all kinds of quirky error messages. 
 Somehow the adap
 ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured. 
 I call tech support, which was clearly overseas, and I'm pretty sure he understood me about as well as I understood him. 
 After 15 minutes on hold and 10 painful minutes with this guy, he basically tells me to download a file from their website which will walk me through. 
 I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better. 
 But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?  
 Anyway, after learning that the ""Speedboost"" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5). 
 Best decision I've made in a long time. 
 First, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City. 
CD   Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly. 
 I was able to use t!
 he brower-based administrative screen with no problems. 
installation   I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router. 
performance , documentation , support   The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4. 
manual   Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with ""MAC settings"", etc. 
 If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.     
"
Linksys Router,"
 I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router. 
 Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic. 
 I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box. 
 Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing. 
antenna   When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage. 
 Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.   setup   Setting up the system was not too complicated. 
 Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones. 
 Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
 d be in the same IP range and see each other. 
 Basically, I set up the box to work as ""router"" (!
 ) as opposed to ""gateway"", disabled DHCP and gave the router an IP number within the range served by the DHCP service from the modem.   
 Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.  
 All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.  
signal   Having done all this, I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal. 
speed   The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard. 
 For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for. 
 If it is needed to make a multi-100 MB disk tranfer (such as back-up copies) it makes sense to connect through the wired network.  
signal   Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc. 
 In my oppinion,!
coverage   the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.

router   We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.  
connection , slow   It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.  
 It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes. 
support  The tech support is worthless too.     
"
MicroMP3,"
 The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. 
instruction   Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset. 
touch-pad , navigate   After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. 
 When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities. 
EXPLAIN   SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
navigating   Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
 I don't care what ELSE it can do.
 I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
sound   All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD. 
bass ,highs[+2}  The base was deeper and the highs were crisper. 
touch-pad , instruction   Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues   and poor instruction guide killed it.

MicroMP3,"
 Why get locked in to crappy Itunes weather you want to or not? 
machine   what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
 i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.

MicroMP3,"
 Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars. 
 I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons.
Zen Micro   This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.
 Ahhh! There is a catch, the manufacturer does not tell you. 
store , INSTALL   Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!! 
 I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc.... 
 I have used similar devices and they are seamless and simple. 
software   Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a ""foreign"" computer just to move over some simple ( .txt) files?  
 This brings my review to one star! 
 But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.  
sound , portability   The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the ""stuff"" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it. 
 It COULD have been a great product. 
 Why isn't it? 
 Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .  
 1.
Button sensitivity   ) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. 
 The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. . 
 2.
FEATURE , recharge cord   ) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? 
cost  You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. 
 If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer. 
 The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer. 
charged   I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. 
 Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket. 
 If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market. 
product   I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. 
 What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord? 
 Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc. 
 Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. . 
 3.
prices   ) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. 
case   The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case. 
case   If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . 
 4.
battery   ) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. 
 Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries. 
rechargeable battery   Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .
 5.
 ) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired. 
FM receiver   The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. 
FM receiver   IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed. 
 I have gone through two of them in two years. . 
 6.
constructed   ) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. . 
charges   As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.

MicroMP3,"
Zen Micro   Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
   Why?  
size , space , battery , look  Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  
touchpad   The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
small   I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  
Media Source , file transfers   Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  
Sound , fm tuner , recorder   Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  
player   This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.        
"
MicroMP3,"
 I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users.  I first want to say that I think Apple is making the same old mistake as they did with Macintosh years ago. 
 This proprietory software to download. 
 (That was a major turn off). 
 I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod. 
player   Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. 
 The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style. 
Headphones   and supply those stupid white Headphones. 
 I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well. 
 Let's face it. 
 Apple is Apple. 
 So Creative should be ""Creative"". 
"
MicroMP3,"
 I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now. 
 With so many choices it was a tough decision. 
 My first instinct was to go with an iPod. 
 I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.  
 I started looking at the Creative Zen Micro and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines I decided I'd give the Zen a try. 
 All I can say is what a wonderful choice! 
 I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!  
small   Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player. 
 I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up. 
installation   The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch. 
 I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in. 
 Pressed play and I was off. 
touch pad   The touch pad does take a little getting used to. 
 I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.  
cable , stand  The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.  
Zen Touch   Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch. 
looks   It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges. 
player   For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.
 Enjoy!

MicroMP3,"
player   I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. 
 I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
Speakers   1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  
Look , Feel   The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. 
 The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing. 
tiny , back   The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). 
feels   It feels tiny in the hand without it. 
stand   The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk. 
 The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot. 
looks , read   The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. 
touch controls   The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. 
touch buttons   The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   
Build   Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. 
hardcase   The hardcase they give with it must work well.  
solid   It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.  
sound   Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. 
sound   I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  
sound   Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  
features   Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. 
 Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book. 
recorded   The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. 
 The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.  
software   Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. 
playlists   Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  
battery life   There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons. 
USB   Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.     
"
MicroMP3,"
creative zen   I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.  
 i have a lot of files in wma so that was the biggest factor in my decision to purchase the zen.  
headphone jack   HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.  
 by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.  
support   The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.  
 i havent used it much yet so i dont know if i will have the same problem; obviously i hope not.  
organization   i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  
 in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.  
 and if you have 2500 songs, as you might very well, you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files.  
sound   the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.  
headphones   the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.  
installation , touch pad   i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.  
 you just get used to it after a while.  
cheaper ,WMA files   i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.  
price   all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.       
"
MicroMP3,"
 This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis. 
 If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod. 
 Bottom line.  
 However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod. 
 For whatever reason. There is also a low number of people, like me, who love iTunes but want to get the Zen Micro. 
 I'll talk more about that later.  
 First of all, why does every single piece of media library software that comes with an MP3 player suck? 
 (iTunes being an exception of course). 
software , feature   The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder. 
 I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain. 
 Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.  
Player   NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.  
 1.
 Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW. 
 Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD. 
sensitivy   Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.  
 2. 
 Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site. 
player  This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.    
 POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1. 
battery   The battery is removable. 
 You can buy a new battery for 49.99. 
 With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
  2.  
FM radio    FM radio built in (Howard Stern).  
 3. 
microphone   Record memos using the built in microphone.  
 4.
looks   The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it. 
 The photos don't do it justice. 
back   The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.  
 5. 
storage   You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.    
 Now, about the iTunes. 
iTunes   I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).   
 This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list. 
 After that, you connect your Zen Micro and open My Computer. 
 Click on ""Zen Micro Media Explorer"" and then click on ""Transfer Data Between PC and Device"" after that, a File Explorer window opens. 
 And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.  
 It's not as seamless as if you were to use an iPod, but it only takes a few seconds longer. 
 So yeah, you can have the best of both worlds.  
   Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work. 
 You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.  
  I honestly don't see the point of buying songs from iTunes when there are so many free alternatives. 
 But if you get that ""fuzzy legal feeling"" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.     
"
MicroMP3,"
 I'm addicted to music. 
 I'm also somewhat of an audiophile. 
 Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me. 
 On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine. 
 On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality. 
 I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro. 
 I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut. 
 The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb. 
 The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] ""to go"". 
 So that's the one I bought. 
 Too bad.  
made   First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made. 
player  One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.  
sound    Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad. 
eq , bass   The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. 
volume    Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. 
headphone jack   The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having. 
 They didn't really make any difference. 
 I also experimented with an adapter for the car. 
sound   If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. 
car adapter   However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter. 
 Hands down, better quality than ipod's. 
 that isn't saying much, but hey, I like to be positive.   
storage   Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. 
storage   I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   
 If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.    Otherwise, you should get an ipod. 
creative  My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
 features It hold's a promised amount of songs, and the headphone jack/volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creative's.   
 If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive. 
 player However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.

MicroMP3,"
 I bought this two months ago at a local retailer, after spending considerable time reading reviews here of this and other 5GB players. 
compatibility with windows media player    While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player. 
format   Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.  
accessories   I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc). 
Zen Micro   And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro. 
working   It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc). 
 Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.   
 I promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife, I'm using a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-canceling headphones with the Zen Micro. 
features , user interface   The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface. 
feel   What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel. 
size   The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid. 
backlight   The blue backlight is pretty cool. 
screen , touchpad   The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.  
sound , audio quality   - Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones. 
 I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.   
 - Integration with Media Player. 
transfer , sync with media player   The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.  
battery   - Replaceable battery. 
 A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.  
 - The FM Radio. 
 I find myself listening to the radio a lot. 
 You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.  
 - Doubles as a removable disk drive. 
interface   With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.  
player   I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.  
battery life   The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most. 
 Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware. 
 They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon. 
 For me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight. 
battery life   Even the ""shorter"" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way. 
warranty price , accessories , player   If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.

 Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.  
 I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini. 
price   The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less. 
 I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.  
sound   Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set. 
look , size   - Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.  
accessories   Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod. 
 I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great. 
 I get occasional hiss while driving. 
battery life   - The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. 
  Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well. 
firmware   I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked. 
outlook sync   - The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -  Several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i'm starting to see why. 
touchpad   I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode). 
 I wish they has a ""lock"" function like cell phones to prevent this. 
audible.com book compatibility   - Not compatible with Audible.com books.  
Zen Micro   Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.

 I first signed up for Napster on line.  
 Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go. 
 They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.  
 So my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.  
 To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.  
 The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.  
 This player is not compatible with Napster To Go. 
 The player was large and bulky.  
 The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.  
 The plus was the storage size but I didn't like hearing the hard drive spin.  
 I also hated the packaging, with a passion.  
 It was one of those plastic glued containers that can take you thirty minutes to open.  
 Accessories were cheap looking.  
 The player was not very appealing either.  
 All this before I found out the bad news.  
 Finally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.  
 Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go. 
 It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.  
 Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off. 
 This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.  
 To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.  
 Its my first purchase choice.  
 Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go. 
player   Don't worry this player rocks.  
appeal   It was also the most appealing.   
 Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.  
packing   For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.  
 I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.  
casing   It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.  
  You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.  
 Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open. 
case   A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.  
 It has Apple insipid written all over it.  
design   I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.    
functionality   Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices. 
player  Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.  
player  It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.  
quality   Everything shines of quality.  
player   I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.  
 First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.  
accessories   I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.  
 Next I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go. 
 I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created. 
 My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast. 
 So the download was much slower.   
interface   The interface works great.  
touchpad   I enjoy getting use to the touch pad. 
navigation   In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.  
sound   What impressed me most was the sound.  
sound   At 128 the songs sound very good.  
 My hobby is home audio and home theater.  
audio quality   The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.  
headphones   The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.  
 Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.  
 I believe them.  
 Overall this play is my introduction into the market.  
Zen  The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.  
 If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.

 I got my Zen Micro last week. 
player   I absolutely love it. 
size   It's so small. 
look  It looks sleek and modern. 
storage   It holds plenty of songs. 
sound   The sound is amazing. 
menu   The menu is easy to use and understand. 
touchpad controls   I love the touchpade controls. 
touchpad controls   They're easy to use. 
radio , voice recording   The radio and voice recording are nice. 
headphones   The earbud headphones are really nice. 
batterylife   The battery has a long life. 
battery replacement   It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. 
file transfer/rip software   The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use. 
file transfer   It's faster than WMP. 
player   So far I have no complaints with this player. 
player   If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. 
price , storage , size   It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.

 If you are like me who wants move to the next phase of portable audio from conventional portable CD players I hope you find this usefull.   
 Space : 5GB =2500 songs. 
 If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection. 
 Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs. 
storage  I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.   
software   User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward. 
 Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user). 
PC  software   PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all. 
scroll bar   The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to. 
storage    You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).   
Battery   Battery : A Big Big plus. 
battery usage  Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery. 
 Zen micro does. 
 I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each). 
 Remember this is a huge plus when travelling. 
battery life   Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours. 
 If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness. 
battery charging   Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.  
FM tuner   FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing. 
 Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.  
FM reception   Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works. 
microphone   Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes. 
 I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.    
sound   Sound: This is where I love Zen the most. 
sound   Excellent sound I mean the player has juice. 
 I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones. 
 The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones). 
bass , treble   The bass treble the sound detail is awsome. 
player   I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.  
look   Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool. 
size   Its compact and has rounded edges. 
size   Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.   
belt clip , stand   Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful. 
belt clip , design   I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem). 
 Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine. 
headphones , accessories   You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.  
headphones , beltclip design   What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design. 
 Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).  
 Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative. 
 This is a must have. 
 Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging. 
sound   FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod. 
 Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking

 I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.  
player   Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.  
Zen micro   While I have not had the ""privilege"", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.
 Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states ""But it's not an IPod!"" or ""Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod"". 
 About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.  
player   By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.  
Zen micro   While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.  
 Apple, on the other hand, seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un-orthodox ""free player"" schemes that just seem to pimp the product without pimping the features.  
 The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.  
look , size , battery life   About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to ""hip"" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the ""awkward"" factor.  
size , design{+3],  It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.  
interface   The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.  
battery life   Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.  
file transfer , software   Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.  
organizer   Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.  
design , features   All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.  
configuration   P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.     
"
MicroMP3,"
look , player   This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  
player   The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  
storage , format   The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  
look , interface   The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  
 In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard. 
 The karma also has a very long battery life.  
 Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.  
 No comparison in my opinion.     
"
MicroMP3,"
functioning   Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright. 
auto load   After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player. 
 I tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results. 
 I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again. 
 I tried the help menu that referenced GUI buttons that don't exist on my version. 
 I'm less than satisfied. 
software   It seems like the software is just not responding. 
support   The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost. 
 They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my ""jukebox"" needed to be purged. 
support   I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.

 After narrowing my choices down to the Zen Micro or IPod Mini, I read countless reviews on both for about a week until my eyes practically started bleeding. 
 I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings. 
 When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro. 
storage , battery , features   The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. 
 Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative. 
working   Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.  
 After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened. 
interface , controls   I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. 
 My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'. 
 One reviewer made what  I thought  was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly. 
 A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device. 
manual   However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro. 
software   While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. 
loading speed   As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song. 
editing titles   I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc. 
 after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already. 
sound   After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.  
FM reception   If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.  
 Zen Micro  Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation. 
 I say get one today!!     
"
MicroMP3,"
functioning   It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general. 
touch pad , access   The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.   
make   Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well. 
player   It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.   
player   If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.      
"
MicroMP3,"
 After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro. 
 Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world? 
 I have my reasons. 
 I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit. 
price , design   Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways. 
player   Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.  
 I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review. 
size   When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY! 
look , size   It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy! 
interface , trim   The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus. 
 The iPods, like most Mac products, have a sophisticated but bland, look to them... Preferrably, I like some sass. 
 :) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery). 
 In stores, the Micro doesn't even come with the AC adapter.  
sound   Moving on to sound department... It delivers! 
 I expected this coming from Creative. 
earbuds , bass   The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass. 
earbuds   I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC. 
functionality , navigation , touchpad   Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it. 
 I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion. 
design   Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.  
extra features   There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock. 
 I'm guessing the more features you enable, the more the battery will drain. 
battery usage   Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable! 
 The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback. 
 And if you read the description on Creative's site, it does mention that the ""actual battery life will vary with use.""
Micro   Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet  knocks on wood . 
storage   It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music. 
music transfer   Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes. 
features , sound quality   It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.  
design , size , comfort , look   Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish. 
variety of colours  - Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from. 
sound   You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a ""special edition"" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable. 
audio formats   - Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.  
touch pad , design , volume control  Weak Points: - Touch Pad: design could be better - Volume Control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick. 
FM reception   - Radio Quality: weak reception     
"
MicroMP3,"
look , storage   It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than ""the other"" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  
color , touchpad   The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad. 
design   But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  
audio , player   What's the point of having ""good audio"" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  
 Creative should hire some real industrial designers.     
"
MicroMP3,"
software   Still has terrible software.  
software   You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.  
look , controls , touchpad   Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.  
storage   You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.  
screen review   Screen review could be better.  
screen review   Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.     
"
MicroMP3,"
player   This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. 
storage , cost   the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. 
features   It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. 
design   Creative did an awesome job with the design. 
headphones , extra accessories   The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. 
player   I have the black one and adore it. 
look , background light   It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. 
touchpad  The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an ""enter"" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal. 
 I take mine everywhere.     
"
MicroMP3,"
size , style   I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini. 
player   Overall, I've been very impressed with the player. 
functioning   I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date. 
 Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim. 
 Originally I was only getting around 8 hours of playtime out of my Zen Micro, but now I consistently get 10-13. 
firmware   I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors. 
battery life   I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.  
sync to windows media player   One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player. 
 With the latest version (10), I can simply browse my WMP library, adding songs/albums/artists to the sync list, and then sync all of the tracks at any time. 
speed , look   Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking. 
 With WMP10, you don't need to install any software other than the driver, which makes using multiple computers fairly simple.  
touchpad   The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example). 
touchpad   They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons. 
touchpad   Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.  
FM reception   The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area. 
radio record   Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.  
look , feel , sound   The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great. 
durability   So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own. 
earbuds   They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers. 
built  I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.

 Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own. 
Zen micro   This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  
 Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems. 
 Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance. 
 To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it? 
 You ask, yup. 
 That's it. 
 I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features. 
 Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
 players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro. 
 My list of ""nice to have"" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.  
features   Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. 
navigation   The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. 
interface   The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that ""Creative"" branding is all over the place within it. 
transfer speed , battery life   Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. 
features   On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. 
design , ease ofuse   So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  
 Not everything in this world is 1!
Zen   00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. 
file transfer   While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). 
response speed   Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. 
 These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such. 
 I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available. 
 Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).  
plaeyr   That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the ""Add to Cart"" button already!

 UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out. 
features , sound quality , music source support   Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. 
 I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work. 
player   So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. 
 Then last week, my player just quit working, period. 
warranty    After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). 
 They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home. 
working   Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
 rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.  
 I loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them. 
quality , reliability   They obviously have quality and reliability problems. 
player   They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  
player   ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! 
player   This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  
sound , rip   I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  
 I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.  
 My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once! 
 Y!
interface   es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  
organization   I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  
WAV format   Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  
 It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try. 
case   My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  
belt clip   Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  
bag   The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  
bag   It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  
 I threw it away.  
 Those are minor complaints though.  
player   I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  
 Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.  
 Amazing.

MicroMP3,"
 I'm a new to mp3 players.  
 For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.  
 After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.  
player   It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.  
features   The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.  
 The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.  
 You can then hook up the Zen via USB to any Win2K or later computer and use that partition to store data files.  
 Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.  
 I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.  
look   The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.  
 The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.  
interface   On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
software   is not as intuitive as I would like.  
earbuds   Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.  
 I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).  
 You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.  
player   Overall, I am very pleased with it.  
player   The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.     
"
MicroMP3,"
 I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back. 
 Doing what, you ask? 
 Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.  
 Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out. 
 But, they rushed it to market, so you, general public, get to roll the dice. 
 Are you feeling lucky today? 
 Who knows -- you may avoid a migraine altogether.  
sound quality   Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.  
headphones   The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds. 
 That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones. 
 I'm getting stunningly good resul!
 ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones. 
 Going further up-market and using super hi-rez audiophile headphones is probably overkill; they will only serve to cast MP3 limitations into sharper relief, and honey, you can't hear what ain't there.  
 An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both. 
 You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music. 
 64 kbps is a terrible price to pay. 
 If you absolutely, positively need over 2,000 songs for your next wolverine photo shoot, get a 10 GB player.   
size   The player is smaller than you think. 
 Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.  
touchpad   The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive. 
 You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.  
 To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
 unboxed and charging up, visit the Creative website for necessary firmware and/or driver upgrades, especially if you're planning to use a service like Napster.  Keep in mind the required upgrade may be a beta version (mine was).  
 2. 
 Some upgrades are needed for the Micro to work properly with the Windows XP operating system and Media Player 10.  
 3. 
You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first). 
 My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.  
sound quality , music subscription service   Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.

MicroMP3,"
 I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon. 
software   The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL. 
player   After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out. 
 I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything. 
working   I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail. 
customer support   Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless. 
 Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions? 
 And t!
player   his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?  
 I think I'll stick to CDs.

MicroMP3,"
Zen micro   The Zen Micro is near perfect.   
 I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.   
 I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips. 
 It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers. 
#3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered. 
built   It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   
 I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.   
 All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
 So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player. 
windows compatibility   The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   
size , sound quality , interface , look , battery , features   It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
 m. 
 When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.   
 It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip! 
 Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.   
 My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy. 
work with WMP   It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it. 
 over and over again. 
 But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch. 
 I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.   
accessories   The accesories that come with the player are great. 
bag   White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag. 
 Also all the required cables and what not. 
 To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
player   best in class. 
player   It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.   
quality   Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.   
player   Pick your favorite color and buy it.      
"
MicroMP3,"
 Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod. 
 Comments such as ""it's stylish"" or ""it looks cool"" or ""everyone has it"" don't nesseseraly make something good.
 About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well. 
touch sensitivity   As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. 
durability   Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to ""unhold"" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. 
durability   After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). 
price   Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. 
 $190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players). 
 As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
 e again.  
design , color   Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. 
 They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors. 
features   It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  
battery   The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    
storage   Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. 
player   If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  
 Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
 he Pencil? 
 Stopping going in circles and get to the point. 
 Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )     
"
MicroMP3,"
 so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.  
player   anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing. 
 I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace. 
 she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.  
 anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware. 
firmware   the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does. 
look , accessories   +looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
 included - charges via USB, so whenever you plug it into your computer, it's charging up. 
battery life , sound quality   +Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right? 
 Aren't they something of digital sound experts? 
navigation   +Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for. 
 Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.  
 before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad. 
scrollpad   It DOES take some getting used to. 
 my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down. 
 it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it. 
 it's a neutral feature in my book. 
 simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
 just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel. 
charging   whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side. 
 -doesn't like to be charged via USB on non windows PCs or PCs that don't have the Zen Micro driver installed. 
button functioning   It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working? 
 Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying. 
 The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC. 
users guide   -User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website. 
 I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
 (linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
 er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
heat   ) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long. 
size   But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.  
player   Overall though, i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player, even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the iPod. ;)     
"
MicroMP3,"
 I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.  
 Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.  
 However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.  
 In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.    
 So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.  
 I had been eyeing the Creative Zen Micro 5GB as I researched various players.  
Napster 2 go compatibility   I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.  
 I have a lot of songs that I need to download.    
 I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
 pick it up from the store.   
 So I decided on the black one.  
player   And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.  
 It is exactly the same size as my flip phone.  
look   It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.   
installation   After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.   
 There were two downloads I had to complete.  
 One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the ""playforsure"" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.  
 I then registered with Napster 2 Go and it immediately recognized my player.  
 And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.  
 Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
sound   The sound is very nice.  
 I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.  
 It also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or use a belt clip.  
 So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.  
lock feature   I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.   
FM reception   I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.   
 I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.  
touchpad   Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.  
 However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.   
player   Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.    
 PS.  
 I've been ZETAZEN long before this player came into existence...lol and my player's name is ZETAZEN.

 I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal. 
 They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price. 
 Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like. 
 You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library. 
 Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...."" My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen. 
Zen micro   However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior. 
sound quality   I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones. 
FM tuner   I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on. 
 When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook. 
scroll bar   I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now. 
ease of usage   Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download. 
size , look   Its also smaller, and gets more looks. 
 People are use to seeing so may Ipods, that when they see my Zen, they have to ask questions. 
extra features   An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. 
player   This is really a no brainer. 
    BUY THE ZEN!""     
"
MicroMP3,"
features   I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.  
 After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod. 
touchpad   The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. 
 This is by far my biggest complaint.  
download speed   Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  charging   Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.     
"
MicroMP3,"
 ... then this might intrigue you greatly.  
 The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.  
 Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.  
 The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.  
 At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a ""free"" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.  
 Then what?  
 What compels you to choose one over the other?  
 It has to be the UI and user experience.  
 The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.  
 The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.  
 So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.  
 It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.  
 The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.  
 Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.  
Outlook compatibility   Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility. 
 This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.  
 I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know  anyone  with an iTunes account.  
 However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.  
 What device would I recommend?  
 Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.  
software , tech support , accessories   Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  
additional accesories   The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  
extra battery{+2]  The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.  
player   If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  
   I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.  
 I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).  
 Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.  
 Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits.    Fred

 I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.  
 I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.  
player , portability , size   This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.  
 My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, ""test drive"", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.  
plug in   I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.  
features , headphones   Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore. 
 And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.

Napster to go compatibility    If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while. 
firmware   A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it. 
 Check out message boards on Napster for more info.     
"
MicroMP3,"
 if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro; 
 these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.   
player   On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.  
sound , storage   The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.    
look , comfort , weight , interface   The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.  
srorage   No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.    
 Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
 instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.  
radio feature   I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.  
FM reception   Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.  
FM reception   It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.  
battery life   The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.  
 Here's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   ""Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music.""  
 Try an additional  six  hours, methinks.  
creative   Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.    
headphones   Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.  
player  As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.  
 To use a bas!
Zen micro   eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.  
player   Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.          
"
MicroMP3,"
 If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.  
 I looked at the market extensively and took a lot of advice before making the big buy here. 
 I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price. 
 Tall order, eh? 
sound quality , battery life , capacity , look , construction , price , compatibility   Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.  
sound quality   Sound quality? Phenomenal. 
sound quality , earbuds   unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.  
 Looks? 
 Let's just say it's no coincidence I put ""Foxy Lady"" on there. 
variety of colors   Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.  
 Capacity? 
 Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most. 
storage   Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums. 
 (Like I really wanted ""Hotel California"" anyway.
 )  Construction? 
construction   Tough as nails. 
construction   No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.
 )  Compatibility? 
compatibility   Flawless. 
 They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
play WMA   ) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.  
voice record , player   The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player. 
sound   Gets nice sound too. 
FM tuner   The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.  
 And the price? 
 A bargain $200. 
 Do NOT buy Apple. 
 Inferior quality at a higher price (and shoddy reliability) is not quite justified just because they have a better spokesperson.  
player   In conclusion, this player is beautiful. 
ease of use , power   Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate. 
player   But it; you won't regret it.

MicroMP3,"
 I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.  
player , functioning , touchpad   This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.  
sound quality   The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.  
radio   The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.  
software , file transfer speed   The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!  
battery , DJ , features   I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!  
 Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.  
look   The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.  
 Overall I have no complaints, this is jus!
price , player   t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?

MicroMP3,"
 I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.  
 That was before the Zen Micro came along.  
player   I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  
look , ease of use , sound quality   it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  
interface , touchpad   I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  
 I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.  
Media player compatibility   Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  
 As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.  
 I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it. 
 This appears to prevent the lockup issue.  
 The battery life doesn't appear to be any!
battery life   where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  
battery life   I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  
 This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.  
storage   The extra Gb is just a bonus.  
headphones   The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of ""ear buds"".  
 Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.  
sound   If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.

MicroMP3,"
 After much research I decided that the Zen Micro was the best mp3 player for me.  
player   Unfortunately I was wrong.  
player   Within one month, my player completely died. 
touchpad , buttons   (It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked. 
working   So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.  
 Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!  
sound   I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.  
 I've tried different headphones, upgrading firmware, using different files and nothing helps.  
customer service   I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.  
I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.  
design   It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.  
player   It's too bad, though, that !
 I don't want to keep testing my luck.  
 This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.

MicroMP3,"	       
Zen micro   The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers. 
 I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod. 
 Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off. 
battery   The Zen offered a great alternative. 
 Now, there are many alternatives to the Ipod, but I wanted a nice design, also, and not some generic looking mp3 player. 
 I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod. 
 I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member. 
 What happens follows:       Let's start with the software. 
software   It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch. 
 You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer. 
 The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy. 
sound quality   The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
 00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software). 
 When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space. 
sound quality   Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either. 
 Check the Zen's S/N ratio and DB rating. 
 They're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom). 
headphones   The included headphones suck, so get your own.         
trnasfer   Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software. 
format   The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod. 
software   The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info. 
 and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen. 
organization   Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen. 
 This feature wo!
labling   rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well. 
 Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored. 
 At least, that is, while it's still alive.        
touch screen   The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies. 
 It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first. 
 A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info. 
 going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes. 
 Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly). 
 The features this thing has are !
FM reception   just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two. 
touchpad light   Oh, and another is the cool ""halo"" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer. 
design   But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.         
size , storage   One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs). 
 It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved. 
 I loved this thing. 
 I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing. 
 It cost less than, in most cases, $190. 
battery   Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!
 chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.        
design   But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything. 
 Why? 
headphone jack design   because the ""engineers"" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack. 
 It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it). 
 There are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it. 
 If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.       
headphone jack   Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage. 
 It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use. 
 Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem. 
 I used them. 
headphone design   Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
 jack that Creative has acknowledge. 
 I know what you are thinking. 
 You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out. 
 If only only it was that simple. 
Zen   The flaw is inside the Zen. 
 You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are. 
headphone jack   The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to. 
 In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.           
 There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?  Exactly, warranty voided. 
 So, if you don't won't to void your warranty, you will have to get in touch with Creative, they will send you a rma number, fix your Zen, but you lose all of your dogon music. 
Zen micro   The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer. 
 Do your research; check !
 out the bulletin boards.

storage   Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???  
 In addition , iPods can be used as portable hard drives and can display your calendars and contact info.      
"
MicroMP3,"
audio quality , ease of use , features   This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features. 
 However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1. 
usage with subscription service   To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC. 
 You will also need to download and install new firmware on the player. 
 At the time of this writing, that firmware is a ""beta release."" 
set up   I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.  
 2. 
transfer speed  #Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly. 
 It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1. 
subscription WMA   This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files. 
 The solution? 
 Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring. 
transfer speed   The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.  
 3. 
 Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit ""play,"" so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts. 
 However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs. 
 The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song. 
subscription DRM-encoded   Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.  
 These issues knock a single star off the review. 
player   Otherwise, this is a great ""alternative"" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple. 
player   I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it. 
 The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.     
"
MicroMP3,"
 Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.  
 I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like ""Just go buy an Ipod!""  
 Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.  
 It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.  
 What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?  
 Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.  
creative   I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  
 Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.  
player   The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  
interface , storage , battery life   It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  
audio quality   Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  
 It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.

MicroMP3,"	 
player   I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned. 
 (The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
 ) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'. 
 However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.  
 I must say that there are several factors that influenced my purchase. 
 An Apple Ipod Mini was considered. 
features   However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.   
storage , battery life , extra features   Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs. 
construction , sound quality , microphone   sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!  
user interface   As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'. 
 It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'. 
converter   This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another. 
formats ,  These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. 
Creative zen Micro   By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.

MicroMP3,"
on , off   I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.  
ear phone jack   Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.  
player   When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.

Nikon coolpix 4300,"perfect to grow into 
 i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner . 
 i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .

Nikon coolpix 4300,"not too excited 
 i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 . 
 reason for two ? 
 it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid . 
 the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing . 
 i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever . 
picture quality  with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; 
transfer  1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . 
 i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader . 
 card reader is included . 
 2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on . 
 3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip . 
 i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar . 
 be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"only "" cons "" here
 the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree . 
 but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though , 
auto mode  . this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped . 
 would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing . 
 . if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data . 
 so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time . 
 in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time . 
image  . even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image 
indoor image  . images taken indoor were n't so clear . 
 you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit 
lens cap  . lens cap is a really annoying 
 . go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card . 
 else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine  "" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 . 
movie  . the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that . 
camera , picture , close-up shooting  but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability . 
 i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"bad service 
menu dial knob  within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob . 
 it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes . 
servicing  i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem . 
 worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty ! 
 they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !

Nikon coolpix 4300,"amazing camera 
 i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world . 
camera  nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price . 
 here were my requirements in a digital camera : 
 1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while . 
 2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that . 
 i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily . 
 3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings . 
 4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much . 
 depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models . 
 nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews . 
 i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since . 
picture  the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . 
 a few things that might make it even better : 
indoor picture  1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . 
delay  2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . 
picture  3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . 
 all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints . 
 try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems . 
 whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty . 
 and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness . 
 hope this review has helped you in making up your mind . 
 i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience . 
 i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .

Nikon coolpix 4300,"super camera 
 with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age . 
 i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 . 
 the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures . 
auto mode , manual mode , scene mode  the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless . 
movie mode  the movie mode is also working great . 
software  the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable . 
 a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution . 
print  i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results . 
print  even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" . 
battery life  the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on . 
 i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" . 
 i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need : 
 a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger . 
 furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" . 
camera  over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !

Nikon coolpix 4300,"camera shake 
 after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one . 
 i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures . 
 however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy . 
 anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix . 
picture  focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange . 
 pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry . 
 pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent . 
 the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models . 
 anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix . 
 i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about . 
 however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .

Nikon coolpix 4300,"great camera 
 i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching . 
 the value , name , and resolution signed the lease . 
picture  after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures . 
digital zoom ,optical zoom  the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! 
picture  the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective . 
feature  i love all of the features , and presets as well . 
sunset feature  sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! 
software  the software you get with this camera is perfect . 
touchup , redeye  touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct . 
 i definately recommend a large memory card . 
 i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution . 
 very large pics take 8mb each ! 
battery life  battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have . 
camera  all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera . 
 making the step from film to digital has been a great move . 
 i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know . 
camera  great camera , great investment ! 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"excellent camera 
 this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models . 
use  the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size . 
 with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation . 
auto setting  the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them . 
 if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .

Nikon coolpix 4300,"the ricksters review 
 after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 . 
camera  it has many great features and very few bad ones . 
picture ,ease of use  it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual . 
 if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual . 
lcd  the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too . 
download  downloads are a snap and quick . 
control  controls easy yo use and easy to get to . 
camera  i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"super little camera 
camera  really happy with this little camera . 
size  it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes . 
 got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day . 
picture  settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints . 
zoomed image  i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive . 
 did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution . 
 i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do . 
camera  still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"beginner looks experienced with coolpix 
camera  this is a wonderful camera . 
 my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months . 
 in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse . 
4mp ,optical zoom  4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price . 
picture  one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"can i have a few more stars please 
camera  this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much . 
software , online service  the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner . 
 100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos . 
 i took the camera and just gave it to someone . 
 no instructions . 
photo  just point and shoot and the photos were great . 
 just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos . 
memory card  the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla . 
 my pda becames a digital album . 
 i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos . 
camera  if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one . 
 go get it . 
 before they are sold out !

Nikon coolpix 4300,"great camera 
camera  great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc. 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"great camera for a great price 
 i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago . 
camera , feature  this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has . 
use  it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into . 
macro  i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots . 
picture quality  my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! 
autofocus  one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low . 
 i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus . 
battery life  battery life is ok . 
 i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"not disappointed 
camera  great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it . 
 i 've been using it for about 3 months now . 
control  i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly . 
quality  the quality is superb . 
size  the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"field tested 
 we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos . 
nikon 4300  the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust . 
 it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade ! 
 we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend . 
 the only drawbacks that i have noticed : 
battery  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot . 
 so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging . 
auto-focus assist light  it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light . 
 i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things . 
optical zoom  it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras . 
 for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length . 
 it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality . 
 i set the camera to the "" manual "" mode for one main reason : 
 in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries . 
 in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features . 
 in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models ! 
 it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera . 
camera  it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping . 
 for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well . 
macro  they take excellent macro shots as well . 
menu  the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"it do n't get better 
camera  i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money . 
picture  the picturers are amazing . 
 do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one . 
 it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"excellent compact digital camera 
 i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years . 
picture quality  recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately . 
txt file  i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take. 
size  the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them . 
 try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card . 
 consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money . 
 an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation . 
 use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run . 
 one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up . 
 i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per . 
 anybody can explain that ? 
nikon  a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"you will not be sorry 
camera  i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate . 
picture quality  we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken . 
camera  i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it ! 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"absolutely great point and shoot camera 
 first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake . 
 for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives . 
 and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 . 
camera  i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations . 
picture ,indoor shot  the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away . 
 the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more . 
image download  uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple . 
indoor shot  the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr . 
 right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras . 
battery life  2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations . 
 i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died . 
 an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment . 
software  3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust . 
 i 'll still use my photosuite for editing . 
 one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing . 
 just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine . 
camera  in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range . 
 - since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera . 
 i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful . 
 i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit . 
 i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand . 
 i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set . 
 this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters . 
 i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time . 
 this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap . 
 the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"great camera 
camera  great camera . 
use  i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use . 
picture  it takes great pictures . 
manual  the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof . 
size  it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket . 
 i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots . 
 now where did i put that manual ? 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"best 4-mp camera of its size and price range 
 do n't let my five star rating fool you . 
 the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six . 
camera  i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down . 
 i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond . 
picture quality  i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time . 
autofocus ,scene mode ,manual mode  autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all . 
 i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card . 
 buy this camera and savour it . 
"
Nikon coolpix 4300,"great camera 
 i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one . 
 this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com . 
camera  i have not been disappointed with my purchase . 
picture quality  picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm . 
indoor shot  on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm . 
 however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures . 
camera  i am extremely satisfied with this camera . 
 i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion . 
 buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short . 
 do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card . 
 you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution . 
 i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember : 
 read the directions ! 
 the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings . 
scene mode  the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting . 
 i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos . 
optical setting  however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take . 
 buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .

nikon  after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck . 
use , accessory  its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake . 
picture quality  yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range . 
design  the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .

picture quality  the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .

 if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol . 
 but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer . 
lense cap  it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good . 
battery  the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .

Nikon coolpix 4300,"excellent little camera 
 i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for . 
use , camera  it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into . 
weight , picture  it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix . 
continuous shot mode  i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots . 
photo quality  i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints . 
8mb card  i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included . 
8mb  8mb for a camera like this is a joke . 
 a card with more memory is a must . 
 a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .

Nikon coolpix 4300,"perfect consumer digital camera 
 if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there . 
 these are the reasons i think it 's great : 
feature  1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want . 
use  2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use . 
size  3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use . 
 4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms . 
 5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome . 
nikon support  6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model . 
picture quality  7 picture quality is excellent . 
battery life  8 battery life is excellent . 
optical zoom  9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range . 
price  10 great price for all the features . 
 here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera : 
firewire  1 no direct firewire to the camera . 
 there is usb , though . 
viewfinder  2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured . 
 this does n't affect the picture , of course . 
 you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture . 
 it 's no problem for me personally . 
 3 battery has to be removed to recharge . 
 4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately . 
 5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses . 
 most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .

 i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really . 
price  this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .

Nokia 6600,"
phone  I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
battery life  The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
battery life  Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
 Why is this phone so great?
 Simple.
phone  It has it all.
phone  This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
phone  If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.
"
Nokia 6600,"
 I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
size  3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
6600  6600 looks and feels nice.
bluetooth  This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
LCD camera quality  Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
PDA  I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
s/w  Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
battery life  Goes ~3 days after a charge.
"
Nokia 6600,"
 Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
phone  I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
priced  I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
phone  I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
use  It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
 Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
keypad  1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
 My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
 I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
keypad  Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
 2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
 Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking.
look  I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
interface  3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
 There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
MMC card  The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
 I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
Capacity  Capacity is not a problem here.
Build  4. The Build is just right.
sturdy  The phone is sturdy.
build  I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
phone  Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
phone  This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
Camera  5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
bluetooth  I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
display  The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
colors  The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
 Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
upgradibility  It has great upgradibility.
 I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net.
 Now that is neat.
log  The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.
handsfree  The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
 I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
processor ear volume  Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
battery life  The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
Video recording  Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
upgrade  You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
 Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
 When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
 In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
phone  This makes for a great phone.
 Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
 gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
 Before buying, I'd urge you to actually use one and not just handle it in the store.
phone  On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
screen  As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
 And remember, this is a PHONE first and foremost which is where I have my biggest complaints...
dial  When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
keys  You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
screen  I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
screen  It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
phone  I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
 Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
 You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.

feels  This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer).
phone  My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
"
Nokia 6600,"
 Don't get me wrong.
 I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
 I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
 In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
 Now I'm back to Nokia to try their 6600 model.

bulky  Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
bluetooth  I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
 Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
Handsfree  Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.
Camera ,video recording  Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
slow  Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.

looking  This one has a good looking.
look  It's oval and... nice.
shape  I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
use  It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.
screen  The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
camera  And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
slow  I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
phone  Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.
 What's wrong with it?
 Is it really slow, or what?
phone  Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
phone  It's good.
phone  But not good enough for me.
color  :! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.

Nokia  I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.
6600  While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
versatility  What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
 The best features that I use most often are:
audio quality  1) Great audio quality overall.
audio quality  Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
 2) Camera phone.
camera  A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
joystick  3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
joystick  The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
ring tone  4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
Nokia  If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
Bluetooth  5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
 This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
wide  6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
small  I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
  You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
construction  My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
construction  I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
  I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
phone  Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.

Nokia 6600,"
interface  OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
 For example, the memory card is under the battery.
operation  The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
 This is representative of the entire phone operation.
 Not for the impatient.
 If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.
instruction booklet  Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
applications  APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
applications  No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
 On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac.
 Me likes.
6600  The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
phone  The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
 I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
DEPENDABILITY  DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
phone  I've had no problems w/ this phone.
keys  STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.
 As for appearance, well, that's subjective.
 Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
stylized  It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
 Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
big  Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big.
screen  Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
MEMORY  MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
memory  First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
transmission  Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
 Still not sure?
 If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
 This is no small deal.
 If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
 RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
6600  The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
coverage  The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
6600  The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
6600  As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
battery life  The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
operating system  Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
video  It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
battery life  The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
 GAMES - Java.
game  Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
 In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
  IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
downloads  There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
 The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.
  The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
 If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated.
phone  A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
  Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.
phone  Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
 It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.
phone  When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
  I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.

Nokia 6600,"
  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE   READ WHY 
 In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
 It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.
 It was a major step up from a Sony t68i.
 The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
 Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
 It's a nice phone, and I'm glad to have used it.
 In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
 Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
 So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
BLUETOOTH  BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
 THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.
Bluetooth  Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
 While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
 With the recent ""bluejacking"" vunerability, the Bluetooth overseers have created a new security system called Combination Key.
 This helps prevent people from sending short ""obscene"" messages to your phone.
 The older security method is called Unit Key.
 Most Bluetooth devices only support the older security system, Unit Key.
 This includes ALL Palm PDAs! Further, due to an unparalled design oversight, Nokia is the only device that supports Combination Key that is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with the older devices that people actually own.
 Does all this sound technical?
 That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.
PHONE  Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
 So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
 He advised me to back up the 6600 to a newly formatted Nokia MMC card, and restore the data to the 3650.
 I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message ""Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer.""
 I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
 I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
 Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
 After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
 I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
 All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
 I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
 Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
 Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
 I called Nokia to try to get it sorted out, and they stated that they had no recollection of ever promising to repair the phone for free.
 They stated that though it was a simple repair they would not do it for less than $120.
 I suggested that it didn't make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30.
nokia  This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
 The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
Nokia  In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
 You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
Nokia  Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.

 The title pretty much says it all.
photos  The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
phone  It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
interface  It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
interface  You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
 Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
lag  Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
number buttons  The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
look ,battery life  The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
camera  The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
  All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.

phone  this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
features  very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
"
Nokia 6600,"
 I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
  If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
phone  This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
slow  The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
time  The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
 Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
 I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
 Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
  If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it.
"
Nokia 6600,"
big  At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
 One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
phone  This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
modem  I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
ringtones  The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
 I could go on and on---but I won't!
 Go see for yourself.
 The ONLY bad thing?
carrier  I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
 A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
 1) phone card calling feature.
Phone card calling  This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
 So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose ""send touch tone"" and find your contact from the address book.
phone card calling  This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
 For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
 All you need to do is to choose your ""phone card"" contact and then ""send touch tone"" and choose the contact.
 This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
feature  My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.
 All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select ""calling card call"".
 2) Low volume on regular answering.
hear  In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
 You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.
volume  Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
"
Nokia 6600,"
 Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
 My explanation is that most of the reviewers are americans that live in the states .....
 the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
 So no wonder a lot of people find the 6600 such a miracle .
 I have purchased the 6600 when it was first released in The Middle East , almost a month before Europe , and reading the brochures and features , it really did sound like a true all-in-one functionality monster .
phone  Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .
volume  1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
bulky  2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
SLOW  3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
 As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
 A firmware upgrade is irrelevant .
phone  4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the ""other than phone"" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
 5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
features  Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
phone  I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
phones  I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .
"
Nokia 6600,"
 I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
phone  I never had a single problem.
menu  It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
video  High quality video and pictures rock!
band  3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
phone  Bottom line great phone for the time being.
"
Nokia 6600,"
color TFT display  I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
Multimedia functions  Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
 So, do I recommend the 6600?
  Yes, certainly.
 But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
6600  The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
keypad ,rundown time  The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.
MMC slot  Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
6600  In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
"
Nokia 6600,"
multimedia  I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.
picture  You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
ringtone  Give each friend a different ringtone.
rings  Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
screen  A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
Nokia  Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
phone  Best phone i've ever owned, period.
"
Nokia 6600,"
 I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
phone  Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.
speed  It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
 Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
phone  Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly.
 I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
 I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
 I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
phone  All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
interface  I think the interface is great.
6600  I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).
 In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
features ,internet connectivity  I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
phone  If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
"
Nokia 6600,"
 I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
signal  UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
Bluetooth  I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
Photos  Photos are pretty darned good!
speed  DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
speed  My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
movies  The ""movies"" last about 5 seconds.
movies  I mean, they're short!
 Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
feature  I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
navigatee  Also, when I dial an ""800"" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
 This is a MUST when you need to get flight times, connect to reservations, etc.
screen  Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
calls  It would not hang up on calls.
screen  Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
phone  Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
 But beware of the bugs; they are major!
"
Nokia 6600,"
 What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
user-interfaces  With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.
phone  Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
camera  The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
 Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
 Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.

 According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
  But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
 I have ordered 2 ""cell phone + service""s from Amazon.
  The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
 The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that ""Can be delayed further"".
  So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
"

phone  This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
service  They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
T-Mobile  I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
  If you're looking for a new company, don't be fooled by the service plans.
 T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  This phone is fantastic.
reception  Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).

rebate  T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.

back cover , battery life  I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
battery life  Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)

 I used to work with t-mobile..
 i have owned many phones with them such as v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205.... and the list can go on!
phone  but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
large  yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
screens  i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
OS  the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
 I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
pics  the pics can be touched up in photoshop, and be printed at 4x6 and they look great!
bluetooth  i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
bluetooth  The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
 I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
 If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
 the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
  i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  The phone itself is pretty nice.
Camera quality  Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
Menu  Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
 But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
 You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
 Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.

features  This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.
Motorola T720i ,syncing data  I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
Bluetooth ,battery life  I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
interface  The interface is simple to use.
menus ,load time  I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
menu  I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
menus  I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
camera  The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
T-Mobile service  On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
T-Mobile service  Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
reception  As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
6600 ,battery life ,connectivity bars  Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.
iSync  For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
Bluetooth  On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
Bluetooth  And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
battery  With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.

Nokia 6600,"
phone  The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
video recorders  The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
voice recorders  The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
games  The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
games  But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.
phones  Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
  If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
battery  The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
battery  This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210

Nokia 6600,"
MMC  I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
video  1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.
pictures  2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.
games  3. Play Java games on it.
games  4. Play N-Gage games on it.
internet  5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
games  6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.
speaker phone  7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.
bluetooth  8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.
call logs  Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
bluetooth  As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
bluetooth  I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
bluetooth  Very simple and painless.
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
  I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
phone  Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support.
6600  The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
internet  One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
GPRS  If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
 For the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.
 On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
 The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
camera  I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
images  Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
feature  And the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account.
e-mail  I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
ringtone  The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
ringtone  Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
bluetooth  You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
ringtones  The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
 Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
OS  I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
applications  Sometimes, various applications crash.
bluetooth  Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
bluetooth  This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
 I'm used to having to restart things.
 On average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.
 I use this phone exculsivly with a Jabra Freespeak 250.
Freespeak  I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
voice-dialing system  The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
voice-dialing system  It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
voice-dialing system  However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
size  Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name ""the bar of soap"" which, it really is.
size  But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
phone  All in all, this is a great phone.
price  Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).
phone  If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  I really love this phone...
T-Mobile  I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
T-Mobile  you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
"
Nokia 6600,"
6600  Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
features  It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
signal  I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.
sound ,speaker phone  The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
size  I like the size and shape.
size  It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
keys  The only problem is the size of the keys.
key  My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
kays  They really are awfully small.
battery life  Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
calls  It also works just fine for international calls.
instant messaging  It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
quality  It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
T-Mobile  I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
customer service agents  Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
calls  I never get dropped calls.
T-Mobile ,Quest Wireless  It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
T-Mobile  I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
"
Nokia 6600,"
6600  The Nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650: you know the 3650, those bulbous, formless, big phones a few unfortunate ATT customers are carrying around.
OS  The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
bluetooth  I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
ringers  Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
ringtones  This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
slow  The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
OS  Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
"
Nokia 6600,"
Hand set  Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
rebate  These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
rebate  For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
customer care  There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
rebates  Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
"
Nokia 6600,"
 I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
features ,speaker phone ,web browser  Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.
 So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
screen  The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
features ,web browser ,video recorder , speaker phone  2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
Joy stick ,memory card  3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
battery  Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
Joy stick ,memory card  3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
battery  The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
slow  2) Phone is awfully slow.
menu  Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
size  3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
 Looks big in the display ads though.
Buttons  4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
Buttons  There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
video recorder  5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the ""Free picture and video messaging"" offered by service provider.
 So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
Phone  The bottom line is ""Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones"".
"
Nokia 6600,"
 my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
 all the other features are gravy.
 i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
iSync compaibility  so, right out of the box i had issue.
sync  namely, it wouldnt sync.
iSync compaibility  after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
 there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
 i may have been up for this 10 years ago, but i just want a phone that works at this point.
 i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
nokia  but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
sonyericsson  if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
 i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
 but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
 this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
phone  if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
"
Nokia 6600,"
 went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
phone  It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
speaker phone ,MMC card  speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
MP3 player  putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
size  DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
battery life  and the battery life is bad !
battery life  I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
battery life  a bit dissapoitnd on that!
GPRS  the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!

phone  I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
Picture  Picture and video quality is ok.
speaker phone  Love the speaker phone.

Nokia 6600,"
MEMORY  INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
MMC card  Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
Picture  Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.
ringtone  you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
Sony T610  you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
T610  T610 supports only midi files.
N6600  N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
N6600  it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
 i'm having mine upgraded to capture endless video, which right now allows 10 secs.
 I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
phone  I love this phone.
"
Nokia 6600,"
phone  This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
OS  Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
phone  You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
programs  Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
MMC memory  It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.
look  Its nice look is also a plus.
SIM-card  And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
phone  I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
"
Nokia 6610,"excellent phone , excellent service . 
 i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service . 
phone , work  there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box . 
 just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted . 
at&t customer service  after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! 
signal quality  i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route . 
 i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition . 
speaker phone  my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared . 
speaker phone  the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise . 
infrared  the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers . 
 the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it . 
"
Nokia 6610,"good phone , so-so service . 
sprint  the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . 
sprint plan ,sprint customer service  after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent . 
 i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl . 
size , sturdy  here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy . 
game  it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio ! 
reception  i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable . 
 also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious . 
sound volume , ear  the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine ! 
ringtone  the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) . 
color  the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be . 
 however , it serves its purpose . 
backlight  the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this -- 
 i checked with nokia . 
button  the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly . 
menu options  the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) . 
 more downside to this phone ? 
volume  the volume . 
 oh my goodness -- 
volume  i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet . 
 forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person ! 
battery life  on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life . 
phone  i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it . 
 i was surprised by t-mobile 's service . 
t-mobile reception  i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous . 
 reason ? 
 they piggy-back on cingular 's service . 
t-zone  also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works . 
customer service  since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" . 
t-zone  i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked . 
 24 hours ? 
 by what time standards -- martian ? 
t-mobile  apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands . 
 also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out . 
customer rep  in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions . 
 but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you . 
 i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me : 
 "" when will my t-zones work ? "" , csr : 
 "" i 'm not sure "" . ) . 
 umm , well , thanks for nothing . 
 this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. . 
 that was annoying . 
csr  t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's . 
call  however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line . 
 and no t-zones . 
 so what 's the point ? 
sprint  i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional . 
 i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services . 
 guess all that glitters is not gold . 
 it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out . 
 hope someone else has better luck ! 
"
Nokia 6610,"the phone refused to die . 
 i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile . 
 recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine . 
 disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone . 
 two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order . 
phone performance  while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . 
nokia  i highly recommend a nokia 6610 . 
"
Nokia 6610,"best phone for free . 
 i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down . 
feature  no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers . 
speakerphone  from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone . 
radio  whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio . 
 wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker ! 
"
Nokia 6610,"glad to own . 
 i have had this phone for about 5 months . 
battery  i treat the battery well and it has lasted . 
 at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days . 
 it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls . 
 signal strength will affect the battery life . 
 frequent signal searches eat up battery power . 
 i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover . 
 i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at . 
volume  the volume level of the phone is not all that good . 
ring  some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to . 
tone  the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 
vibration  the vibration is not top . 
 it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in . 
 i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it . 
 vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this . 
 so it was no loss . 
phone  overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . 
battery life  great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like . 
 i do hope that they offer more faceplate options . 
look  i am bored with the silver look . 
"
Nokia 6610,"cool . 
color screen  it has a nice color screen . 
size  it is small . 
radio , radio  radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in . 
 that is a major minus , but its not that bad . 
t-mobile  t-mobile was a pretty good server . 
 it has 2 games . 
game  they are not wowable good . 
 you have to buy better ones . 
voice dialing  it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! ! 
 "
Nokia 6610,"great phone , but no warranty ! 
phone  this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it . 
 nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon . 
phone  we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use . 
 i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back . 
"
Nokia 6610,"menu flaws ? mine could n't send text messages . 
 i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store . 
message  when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there : 
 it defaulted to unchangeable email . 
 so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem . 
 i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't . 
 he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail . 
 so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours . 
sound quality , fm , earpiece  while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . 
size , operate , button  negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button . 
key  poor visibility on the keys . 
 you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them . 
"
Nokia 6610,"great speakerphone and great reception ! ! reccomend ! 
 the title says it all ... 
speakerphone , reception  the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ... 
camera  only con i can think of is no camera ... . 
 no big deal for the size . . 
phone  this phone is a winner ... 
"
Nokia 6610,"perfect . 
phone  anything this phone does , it does perfectly . 
speakerphone  the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly . 
 the speakerphone : 
speakerphone  this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone . 
speakerphone  as said before this works perfectly . 
volume  you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 
speakerphone  the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly . 
speakerphone  you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly . 
speakerphone  only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . 
 the radio : 
radio  this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . 
radio  this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly . 
 tri-band : 
feature one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia . 
phone  i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . 
t-mobile  the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile . 
reception  anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception . 
 if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe . 
 sold in other parts of the world : 
phone  another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . 
phone  this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . 
 or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe . 
 i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service . 
 able to use service in another country : 
 if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country . 
 you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country . 
 size and weight : 
size  when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . 
size  this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . 
 battery life : 
battery life  the battery life on this phone is surreal . 
 it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby . 
battery  i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . 
battery  it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . 
phone  this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . 
bluetooth ,high speed internet  the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . 
phone  overall , i highly recommend this phone . 
phone  it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package . 
"
Nokia 6610,"so far i am more than pleased . 
 i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go : 
 pros : 
size  size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you . 
ringing tone  sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored . 
speakerphone  speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch . 
web  surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available . 
 cons : 
ring tone  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring . 
screen  the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out . 
game  games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .

Nokia 6610,"great buy . 
phone  nice little phone ... light compact . . 
 great features . . 
button  buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..

Nokia 6610,"it works ... as a phone ! 
 perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest . 
 after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform . 
 i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device . 
wireless telephone  although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone . 
reception ,sound quality  the reception and sound quality are top-notch . 
 i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service . 
size  i like the size and weight of this little critter . 
size  i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed . 
layout  the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird . 
key  the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead . 
 but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle . 
screen  the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors . 
picture  it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones . 
user interface  there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . 
menu option  the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad . 
 thumbs down on that one . 
vibrate setting  the vibrate setting is loud ! 
vibrate setting  so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option . 
ringer  but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . 
 which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ... 
voice dialing ,headset jack  other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . 
 i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ... 
 pros : 
weight , design  - light , compact design 
construction  - solid , high-quality construction 
keypad  - well-backlit keypad 
reception  - outstanding signal reception 
sound quality  - excellent sound quality 
screen  - bright , visible screen 
speakerphone  - speakerphone 
battery life  - very long-lasting battery life 
 cons : 
user interface  - some features in the user interface 
voice dialing  - no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking 
picture , ringtone  - no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones . 
headset jack  - no propietary headset jack

Nokia 6610,"best of the best mobile phone . 
nokia  while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones . 
 after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 . 
phone  and really this is the best phone one could have . 
feature  it has all the features one would need in a cellphone . 
weight  it is lightweight , sleek and attractive . 
phone , menu  this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc . 
 the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only . 
radio  it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime . 
speakerphone  its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside . 
wallpaper  it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes . 
camera  only if we could get one camera in it . . 
 it did have scored over all other competitors .... 
phone  i am enjoying my phone a lot .... 
"
Nokia 6610,"cool phone ! 
 like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program . 
 i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me . 
 pros : 
size  small size . 
size  i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it . 
 just make sure the keys are locked . 
color screen  color screen is good . 
calendar  it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar . 
key  the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing . 
menu  navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . 
battery life  battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . 
 cons : 
 not many . 
volume key  the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call . 
pc cable  pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ? 
 please ! 
 is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ? 
"
Nokia 6610,"slightly better than average phone in its class . 
 first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) . 
 my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone . 
 below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends : 
 sound quality : 
 the most important thing for me is sound quality . 
sound quality  nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception . 
 i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series . 
loud phone  the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . 
 overall design : 
size  i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets . 
 of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest . 
 the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small . 
 as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys . 
 ease of use : 
 how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ? 
 the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) . 
 that is a very nice feature . 
 the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) . 
 the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use . 
 battery : 
 the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much . 
 the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) . 
 features : 
 the t610 has the most functionality hands down . 
 personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice . 
 my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity . 
 the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use . 
radio  the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 
application  it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) . 
 the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla . 
 all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready . 
 in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones . 
software  regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop . 
 i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft . 
 oh well .. 
phone  overall this is a slightly better than average phone . 
 both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 . 
 personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more . 
 i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year . 
 if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 . 
 they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling . 
"
Nokia 6610,"perfect phone . 
phone  this is the best phone i have seen . 
"
Nokia 6610,"i bought 2 . 
 i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend . 
 we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons . 
phone  the phones are awesome . 
battery life , application  we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome . 
 here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth . 
pc suite  you can do   so   much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games . 
sound quality  the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing . 
"
Nokia 6610,"nokia 6610 great for games and ringtones . 
phone  i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it . 
size  nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com 
"
Nokia 6610,"nokia 6610 . 
phone  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had . 
radio  the features are really cool like the radio . 
radio  the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . 
speaker  technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! ! 
 why i do n't can this product without a plan ? 
 i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators . 
 i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account . 
 please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy . 
 thanks ! 
"
Nokia 6610,"excellent , but only gsm ? 
phone  i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone . 
 as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band . 
phone  for a specific location , i still think its a great phone . 
"
Nokia 6610,"i really think . 
 i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it . 
"
Nokia 6610,"great phone , but what did you say ? 
phone  this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! 
 i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one . 
size  this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out . 
 the downside though , may be a big one for you . 
volume  its quiet . 
 really quiet . 
 grandma in church quiet . 
 i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it . 
 so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . ) 
"
Nokia 6610,"incredibly pleased . 
 i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer . 
 prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider . 
 to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing . 
 my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them . 
nokia  nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them . 
volume  first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint . 
reception  i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) . 
size  the phone is small , light , and very attractive . 
battery life  the battery life is amazing . 
color screen  the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones . 
phone  i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs . 
phone  i highly recommend this phone to anyone . 
 i 've yet to be dissappointed . 
"
Nokia 6610,"
 nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality . 
sound  i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough . 
 it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 . 
 you do take your chances with this phone . 
"
Nokia 6610,"ultimate phone for mobile life . 
 i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features . 
phone , feature  it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features . 
 truly , i am quite impressed . . ! ! 
weight ,battery life  this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) . 
 on an average , you would charge it once a week . 
speakerphone  the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . 
speakerphone  i simply love this feature . 
headset  in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset . 
radio  the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport . 
 if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more . 
pc sync  the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) . 
 no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad . 
 just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth . 
tone  additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. ) 
message ,picture sharing  the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy . 
mms  the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy . 
 the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff . 
 if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone . 
 however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone . 
 i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon . 
 i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features . 
phone  i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime . 
"
Nokia 6610,"awesome phone choice . 
 after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative . 
 i was immediately interested in the 6610 . 
 i have used this phone for two months now . 
size  not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . 
 if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more . 
use  in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned . 
phone book  the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent . 
radio  even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio . 
 if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are . 
voice dialing  although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing . 
key  the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press . 
battery life  however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off . 
volume control  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . 
 it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone . 
headphone jack  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . 
phone  overall this is the best phone i have ever owned . 
 any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages . 
phone  nokia does not disappoint in this model . 
 go for it ! 
"
Nokia 6610,"awesome phone , great prices on amazon.com . 
 i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular . 
screen  one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched ! 
 but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ... 
 almost there . 
 i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal . 
 i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along . 
 this is almost it but not quite but the price was right . 
 that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce . 
battery life  it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps . 
 what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge . 
 so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again . 
 but for now this will do . 
 oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam . 
phone  great phone .. . 
feature  great features .. . 
"
Nokia 6610,"great plan . 
 i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years . 
size  i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email . 
 i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads . 
 they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email . 
 with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet . 
phone  i have had no problems with the phone . 
 friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it . 
 i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive . 
phone  great phone , i 'd buy another . 
"
Nokia 6610,"excellent phone . 
phone , look  excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures . 
 bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better . 
default ringtone  one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible . 
phone  overall an excellent phone . 
t-mobile  the service from t-mobile is very good too . 
 in all a winning combination . 
 worth every penny ! 
phone  great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! ! 
"
Nokia 6610,"yo what a find . 
phone  i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it . 
phone  nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby . 
 it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it . 
 now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school ! 
 people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant . 
service  service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . 
 now i can always be in contact . 
phone  this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones . 
 a great deal in general ! 
 i would not give up this phone for the world . 
phone  1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone . 
feature  yes , the features are numerous . 
speakerphone  the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had . 
 people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone . 
sound quality  the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a   tad   too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line . 
earpiece  the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use . 
phone  i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before . 
 nokia has definitely won me over with this one . 
"
Nokia 6610,"best phone out there ... a+ not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap ( free ! ! ) . 
size , look{+1] first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better . 
radio  the radio feature has superb sound quality . 
 i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 . 
 even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them . 
design  it has a classic design yet looks hip . 
 is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel . 
weight  it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket . 
 for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style . 
battery  the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there . 
 one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online . 
 every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) . 
 anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) . 
 tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans . 
 if you thought about getting this phone buy it . 
phone  this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities . 
"
Nokia 6610,"6610 = great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone ( s ) on demand . 
 i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile . 
 the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering ! 
 that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port ! 
 using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account . 
 yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for . 
 i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck ! 
internet  the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all . 
 i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" . 
browsing  it does well in all aspects of internet browsing . 
 as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it . 
"
Nokia 6610,"sound good but complicated . 
 do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate . 
 also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. . 
 so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates . 
 and how can i do that ... . 
 print those coupons twice for two phones ? 
 ... 
"
Nokia 6610,"do n't have the phone just commenting . 
 i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing . 
 the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia . 
 the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone . 
 my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset . 
game  i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing . 
 i do n't really like bounce . 
 i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones . 
battery life  battery life is good for a phone of this size . 
voice dialing  but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing . 
screen  great screen and great sound . 
 ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ? 
phone  the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god . 
voice quality  the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) . 
screen  the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive . 
button  my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons . 
 nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary . 
key  this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands . 
 ( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . ) 
phone  other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips . 
t-mobile  finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier . 
t-mobile  their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience . 
 if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers . 
"
Nokia 6610,"great phone , great service , no voice dialing . 
phone  the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is . 
 when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small . 
size  after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket . 
earpiece  it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included . 
 the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number . 
voice dialing  unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming . 
screen  when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is . 
resolution , color  the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! 
 the phone has several color schemes you can choose from . 
 i like the default blue . 
 you can also set a background wallpaper . 
ringtone  the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? 
 no more annoying series of beeps . 
 this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music . 
ring  you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call . 
 the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact . 
phone  the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection . 
gprs  the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful . 
 you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks . 
 the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go . 
t-zone  one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 . 
 their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported . 
 i have been assured this will be fixed soon . 
 now , for the t-mobile service : 
 i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones . 
 if you have a question , they have the answer . 
 and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick . 
 every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone . 
t-mobile service  all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved . 
 i 'd like to see my old carrier do that ! 
rate plan  the rate plans are also very good , at least for me . 
 different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive . 
 the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked . 
phone  this phone is highly recommended otherwise . 
"
Nokia 6610,"t-mobile ruins an otherwise good phone . 
phone  nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear . 
menu , feature  with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great . 
menu  the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have . 
 one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe , etc. 
 yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch . 
internet  the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network . 
 therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet . 
 after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone . 
 bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it . 
 find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form . 
"
Nokia 6610,"a good phone . 
phone , feature  this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it . 
 i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . . 
 i did n't had any problem till now . 
design  the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution . 
weight  it is very light weight and has a good signal strength . 
sound quality  however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . 
 it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier . 
voice  when talking the voice is not very clear . 
phone  but , i would definately recommend this phone . 
 go for it ... 
"
Nokia 6610,"people with bad audio quality have defective phones . 
 i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about . 
sound quality  it is crystal clear . 
phone  this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made . 
 i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks . 
 there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .

software  I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
 Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
Norton products  But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
McAfee Anti-Virus 8  It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
Norton  I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.
Norton  I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
"
norton,"
 I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
 I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
Installation  After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up.
 I am thankful that I have Roxio GOBACK, I had to use it 3 of the 4 times.
NIS  During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
Manual shutdown  The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over(up to 1 hr, I then shut it down and used GOBACK).
product  The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.
Norton   I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
NIS 2003  NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year.
Norton  Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
installed  Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.
Norton  Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.

product   As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).
 Here's why:
"
norton,"
program  Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
Anti-Spam Anti-Spam is Good
antispam function  The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
updates  Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
Symantec softwares    But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.
scandisk  So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
"
norton,"
product  Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.
suite  Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
"
norton,"
speed  I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
speed  Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
Semantic  Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
 I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
 So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
 This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?

norton,"
 I've been using Norton Anti-Virus in its many incarnations for over 5 years.
NIS2004  Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
 Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
"
norton,"
 I also reviewed Norton System Works 2004/Professional.
installation  This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
product  For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
 Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for ""Internet Security 2004"".
SystemWorks , Internet Security  This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.
 It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
antivirus  The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
antivirus  I think their antivirus software was one of, if not the best, on the
 Well, no more.
Internet Security 2004  This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
install , function  They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
installation  The biggest problem is the installation.
installed , System Works , Internet Security  Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
product  I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
 Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
installation  First, it serious, serious installation problems.
install  Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
 Since then, I have had one problem after another.
 To say that it is ""buggy"" would be the world's most profound understatement.
LiveUpdate  Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
updates  First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
LiveUpdate  When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
components  The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
 Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.
 Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
functions   Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
faster , menu  These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
LiveUpdate  But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
installs  The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
removal program  Warning! The Windows ""remove program"" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
fragments   A lot of ""fragments"" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
remove  Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the ""Programs"" directory.
install  If you have an older version of ""Internet Security"" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
remove  You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
 (Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)
 Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
products  As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
functionality  I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.
reinstall  Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
version 2004  The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
Symantect products  Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
 And that's a shame.
 They use to be so useful and neceesary.
 No longer.
product  Avoid this product at all costs.
"
norton,"
 Antagonising
2004 edition  There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows.
program , cost  The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
"
norton,"
support  I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a ""customer priority ID number.""
priority ID  Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
support  So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).
Norton  And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
 I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.
 Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
 I was totally baffled.
"
norton,"
 I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.
 The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
 This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
 The only reason I'd buy them separately in the combo package is for two liecenses.
 If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest.
memory usage  Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
 It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
memory usage  I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
update  Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
update  You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
visual backtracking  The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
 An infected computer tried to launch an attack on mine and I was able to get a map and address of the server.
"
norton,"
 I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
 I followed the instructions to the letter.
 But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
product  Stay away from this product!
2004  I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage.
 Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
support  The customer support is pathetic.
"
norton,"
Norton internet security  I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
"
norton,"
 Okay, how can I say this nicely?
product  This product is absolutely not ready for release.
slow  It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
product  I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
"
norton,"
 Norton has a name in the market but I think it's only the name.
Internet Security , antivirus  It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
 The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.
internet security , antivirus software  Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
"
norton,"
parental controls  Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
 Had to uninstall it.
 Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
"
norton,"
 I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
firewall  Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
capacity , Support  Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
 I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.
product , upgrade  So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
"
norton,"
2004 version  If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't.
activation process , product  There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
product  If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
 It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
"
norton,"
 This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
Norton program  From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to ""ccApp.exe"" program running which is a Norton program.
Norton  Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
memory usage  We constantly got ""Windows Virtual Memory Low"" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
 I don't have one good thing to say.
 I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
support  Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
 It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
 The tests were right.
 It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
support   Norton support is completely pathetic.
 We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
 We were leary to say the least, but decided to give Norton the benefit of the doubt.
 We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.
 The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
 We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
 I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
 If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up, I'm done with Norton products forever.
 But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.
 72 hours later after installing, it started doing the exact same things!
 So, we're fed up.
HOME VERSION  DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
Corporate Edition  We were able to obtain a Norton Corporate Edition of Antivirus only (no firewall or utilities) and so far it's great.
Corporate edition   I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
 Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
Corporate edition , home version  If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
 We'd have probably tried McAffee, but I hear from reviews that it has troubles too.
 HMMMM.. Good luck.
Norton Internet/AV 2004  Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
 I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
 WRONG - SEE MY UPDATE ABOVE.
corporate  By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
professional version  Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too.
home version  Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
 Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
"
norton,"
 I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
 So I expected the same level of quality and ease of use with their Internet Security program.
work  I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
 After installing, the system froze trying to restart (this is a new computer with Windows XP Home).
 After finally restarting, the ""automatic updates"" ran.
 When all was said and done, I couldn't even use Microsoft Outlook.
program scan  Seems the ""program scan"" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
 It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
 Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
support  Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT.
Symantec  It was a Symantec error.
update  After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
support  I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
 Again, I tried online email support.
 They gave me a ridiculous set of steps which included emailing them screen prints as PDF files!
 I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
 Eventually I will uninstall this troublesome bug-filled program.
 Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...
"
norton,"
  Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.
products  This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
"
norton,"
  I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
 I wish I'd done some research first....
"
norton,"
NIS 2004  I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
options , intrusion  Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
intrusion  Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
popup blocker , anti-spam  The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
"
norton,"
Product , instruction  Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.
 Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
"
norton,"
nstalling  I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
components  The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.
 I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.
working  Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
installation  I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.
installation   If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
installation  Can't get easier than that!
 Avoid like the plague.
spam  I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
 For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
"
norton,"
 Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
install  Mine installed no problem (but I DID uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus 2002 & Personal Firewall 2002 first).
work  Seems to work great.
 Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).
"
norton,"
 I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
NIS 04  I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
 In January of 2004, I renewed my subscription service for NIS 2003 but on Jan 7, everything changed.
 There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
 The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
 I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
 All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
booting  Booting up my computer took forever!!!
blocking  Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
blocking  My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
 After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
Tech Line  Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
 I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
tech  After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...
 They sent me a link to their website to follow instructions on ridding my registry of all Symantec products so I could get a clean re-install.
tech  They didn't know what the problem could be.
 They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.
support  I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
 I gave up.
Tech  Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
"
norton,"
 NIS is a package of several Norton products.
unstalling  Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
 If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.
components  You can ""disable"" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
Norton AntiSpam  Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
 Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.
 I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
 Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.
product  This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
popups  But those 2 come up every time.
 And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.
Norton , charge  Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
charge , Norton  Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
 And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.
 Nice little racket they've got there.
"
norton,"
 I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.
NIS   While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
"
norton,"
installing  The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
install  When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
"
norton,"
 This is a very full featured product.
 It checks every 5 minutes for virus and spam definition updates.
Spam killer  Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
wizard  And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
"
norton,"
download  I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
 I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
 I lost all my personal info.
help  Their site offers no live help at all.
service , support  I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
cost  Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).
support  I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.
refund  They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to ""handle"" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
product , support  This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
support  After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.
Norton  No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
Norton  I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
 A security software suite with lots of value
 While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
firewall , antivirus , antispam , Parental Control  It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
 Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.
 Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
"
norton,"
version 2004  I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
installing  If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
 It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
product  Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
install , uninstall  To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
 If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
installation  If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
support  What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
zone alarm  I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
 Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
symantec  I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version!

 I really liked the firewall.
 It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
 THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.
 I have gone to their site many times in the last two months looking for an answer.
 I've tried lots of things they suggest.
 My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
help  The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
Firewall  The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
 It's become tedious doing this.
 Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
 Buy ZONE Alarm.
 Wish I had.

 I read how the buyers of this product watched their computers turn into processing sloths, bought a copy and watched my 2.4 Gig XP Pro processor slow down below the level of my 750 Meg 2000Pro laptop!
 At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
 So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
Symantec  Symantec should give us all a refund and apology!
product  I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you.
 BEWARE!!!!

product  The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
antivirus  No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.
antivirus  I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
 I have XP with 256MB RAM, 40GB memory.
product  This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
product  5 stars all the way!

 I've had the last 3 versions of NIS.
Product   All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
Symantec  However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.

firewall , security suite  While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
boot  I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
antivirus , internet security (cs) The Antivirus is good, but ""Internet Security"" just isn't worth it.

performance  I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
NIS 2004   This is also the case with NIS 2004.
 I've seen many reviews praising 2003 and cursing 2004.
upgrade  performance  I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
upgrade  On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
performance , features  It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.

 I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual).
program  The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
 I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
 My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
installation , set-up , operation interfaces , email spam  The installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well.
symantec  HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
performance  It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
performance  I tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement.
symantec/Norton site  There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
 I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
 I purchased this even though I saw some disparaging reviews at the Amazon site, trusting PC Magazine to get it right.
PRODUCT  However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.

Uninstall , Install  PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
 First, I turned off my cable modem.
 Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
 I used ""Add/Remove Programs"" to unistall NIS 2003.
 In ""Add/Remove, you must selecting the program's Change button.
 After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the ""Programs"" section of Windows XP.
 Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
 I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
install  I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
Anti-Spam  So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.

 I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.
program  This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
 I gave up trying to figure how to get my email sent or listen to streaming programs.
product  Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
 For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.

 I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program.
 I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
processor  I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
 I decided to give it one last chance... so I formatted my hard drive, reinstalled Windows XP (which also required a day & night download/install of SP2 on dial-up) and put NIS2004 back onto the computer.
install  It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)
 Blessedly, my DSL was installed just about this time and I set up a wireless network with my desktop.
 So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
Computer Associates EZ  I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
 I can't recommend their programs enough.
Norton  And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!

 I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
 About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
 Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
installation  I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
 I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.
speed  It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
size , scanning  I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.
scan  Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
 I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.

firewall  I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
slow  Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
home network  Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible.
network  Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
 Avoid at all costs
 I just about lost it this morning with this software.
alerts  While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with ""alerts"" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.
alerts  But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.
uninstall  I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
Uninstall  I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required ""permissions"" and lacked proper administrator status.
 On my own home computer.
Symantec customer service  Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
 Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.
 Finally I ran msconfig and went into the ""services"" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec ""service,"" then ran uninstall again.
uninstallation  This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
Symantec  I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.

 I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.

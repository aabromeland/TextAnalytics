    "### Purpose:\n",
    "- To obtain data from the SEC edgar search and stock market to see the impact of reportings to the SEC on stock valutaion of Deere & Co. Will look to develop a model with Deere and then try to apply it to other companies within the industry and then potentially other companies outside of the Agricultural/Construction and Forestry Industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Background:\n",
    "     - Deere & Company is an Agriculture and Construction and Forestry manufacturer that is headquartered in Moline, Illinois. Deere & Company started in 1837 after John Deere invented the self scouring plow in 1836 that allowed Midwest farmers to plow the thick black dirt of the Midwest without clogging. The company started in the town of Grad Detour, Illinois, and was moved in 1848 to Moline, Illinois. The company started with the technological advancement of the plow that was made from steel instead of cast iron and has since led the industry in technological advances in agriculture all the way to today with the introduction of the first commercially available fully autonomous tractor.  The company was formally incorporated as Deere & Company in 1868. John Deere served as the Founder and president of the company from 1837-1886. Then decedents of Deere served as President and Chairman from 1886-1982 (Charles Deere, William Butterworth, Charles Deere Wiman, William Hewitt). Then from 1982-today, John Deere has been run by members outside of the Deere family (Robert Hanson, Hans Becherer, Robert Lane, Samuel Allen, and John May)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project Goals\n",
    "    - The project is hoping to identify trends in SEC filings that correlate to positive or negative stock returns. Specifically, we are looking to identify long term trends in the data to determine if SEC filings can help point to long-term growth opportunities in the stock of Deere. Additionally, we would like to extend this analysis beyond Deere to other companies first in the Agricultural and Construction and Forestry industries, and if we get successful results, then extend this to other company filings, as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Research Questions\n",
    "    1.\tWhich standard forms filed with the SEC have the highest sentiment scores?\n",
    "    2.\tWhich standard forms filed with the SEC have the lowest sentiment scores? \n",
    "    3.\tWhich standard forms filed with the SEC have the highest variance in sentiment scores?\n",
    "    4.\tWhich filings coincide with the greatest change in stock price for the company? \n",
    "    5.\tDo SEC filings have a material impact on the stock price of Deere & Co?\n",
    "    6.\tCan the sentiment analysis developed for Deere & Co be applied to other companies within the agricultural and construction industry?\n",
    "    7.\tCan the sentiment analysis developed for Deere & Co be applied to other companies outside of Deere’s industry? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Source\n",
    "    - The dataset is comprised of 1000 filings of Deere with the SEC from October 3rd, 2011 to May, 31st, 2022. Initially, the shortest document in the dataset was 37 characters long with average character lengths of 24,110. However, 38 documents had under 500 characters in them. These were removed because after review of these documents, they were for PDF files that had been loaded or were references to other paper submissions that had been done.  After removing these documents, the average character lengths of the documents were 25,054 with a maximum character length of 564,539 and minimum character length of 539.\n",

measures to prevent its spread are affecting our business in a number of ways, which shouldbe considered in connection with an investment in the notes. for further discussion, see ourcurrent report on form8-k filed on march23, 2020,which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, and \"risk factors\\x97risks related to covid-19\\x97the covid-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows\" in this prospectus supplement. s-5 table of contents     risk factors        in evaluating an investment in the notes, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and the risk factorsdescribed under the caption \"risk factors\" in the accompanying prospectus and in ourannual report on form10-k for the year ended november3,2019, which is incorporated by reference.    risks related to covid-19        the covid-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and/or cash flows.  covid-19 was identified in china in late 2019 and has spread globally. the rapid spread has resulted in authorities implementing numerousmeasures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. even though we believe we are a u.s. federally-designated essentialcritical business, these measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors andsuppliers. we have significant manufacturing operations in the u.s., canada and other countries, and each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it.there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures. future restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, orsimilar limitations for our suppliers, and restrictions or disruptions of transportation, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our ability to meet customer demand andhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. there is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigatethe risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. inrecent weeks, the covid-19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, whichincreases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital. it is likely that the covid-19 pandemic will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a globalrecession. risks related to negative economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled \"negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere\\'s equipment andservices, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs\" under \"risk factors\" in our annual report on form10-k for the year ended november3, 2019. theultimate magnitude of covid-19, including the extent of its impact on our financial and operational results, which could be material, will be determined by the length of time thatthe pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for our products and services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic. we cannot atthis time predict the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.     risks related to the notes        an active trading market may not develop or be maintained for the notes.  each series of notes is a new issue of securities with no established trading market. although the underwriters may make a market for the notesof any series after we complete this offering, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue making a market in any series of notes at any time without notice. we have not listed and do notintend to apply for listing of any series of notes on any securities exchange. theliquidity of any market for each series of notes that may develop will depend on a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates, our financial condition, liquidity andoperating results, the number of holders of the applicable series of notes, the market for similar securities and the interest of s-6 table of contentssecuritiesdealers in making a market in such notes. we cannot assure you that a trading market for any series of notes will develop or, if developed, that it will continue, or as to the liquidity ofany trading market for the notes of any series that may develop or as to the price you may receive should you wish to resell any notes you acquire in this offering. the notes are subject to early redemption.  as described under \"description of the notes\\x97optional redemption,\" we may at our option redeem the notes of any series any time inwhole, or from time to time in part, at the redemption prices described therein. consequently, we may choose to redeem your notes at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the effectiveinterest rate paid on your notes. as a result, we cannot assure you that you will be able to reinvest your redemption proceeds inan investment with a return that is as high as the return you would have earned on your notes if they had not been redeemed and that has a similar level of investment risk. s-7 table of contents    use of proceeds        the aggregate net proceeds to us from the sale of the notes will be approximately moneytoken after deducting the underwriting discount andour estimated offering expenses. we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes. s-8 table of contents    description of the notes        the notes will be senior debt issued under the indenture dated as of september25, 2008 (the \"indenture\") between us and the bank of newyork mellon, as trustee. information about the indenture and the general terms and provisions of the notes is in the accompanying prospectus under \"description of debt securities.\" eachseries of the notes will constitute a separate series of debt securities under the indenture. we will initially issue a total of moneytoken principal amount of 2025 notes,moneytoken principal amount of 2030 notes and moneytoken principal amount of 2050 notes. wemay, without giving notice or seeking consent of note holders of any series, issue additional debt securities having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and otherterms as the notes of any series. any such additional debt securities and the applicable series of notes will constitute a single series of debt securities under the indenture, including for thepurposes of voting and redemptions; provided that such additional debt securities are fungible with such notes for u.s. federal income tax purposes. no additional debt securities may be issued underthe indenture if an event of default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the applicable series ofnotes. inthe accompanying prospectus, there is a section called \"description of debt securities\\x97provisions applicable to both of the indentures\\x97defeasance\". thissection has provisions on the defeasance and covenant defeasance of securities issued under the indenture. these provisions will apply to each series of the notes. thenotes will be issued only in book-entry form in minimum denominations of moneytoken and integral multiples of moneytoken in excess thereof, with the notes of each series represented by oneor more fully registered global notes deposited with the trustee as custodian for, and registered in the name of the nominee of, the depository trust company (\"dtc\"), as depositary. beneficialinterests in book-entry notes will be shown on, and transfers of the notes will be made only through, records maintained by dtc and its participants. see \"book-entry, delivery and form\" below and\"description of debt securities\\x97provisions applicable to both of the indentures\\x97global securities\" in the accompanying prospectus. payment of principal and interest  the 2025 notes will mature on april15, 2025. the 2030 notes will mature on april15, 2030. the 2050 notes will mature onapril15, 2050 . however, each series of notes will be subject to optional redemption as described below under \"\\x97optional redemption.\" theinterest rate on the 2025 notes will be 2.750% per annum. the interest rate on the 2030 notes will be 3.100% per annum. the interest rate on the 2050 notes will be 3.750% per annum.we will pay interest in arrears on april15 and october15 of each year, beginning october15, 2020 (long first coupon). interest on the notes will accrue from march30,2020 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for until the principal of the notes has been paid or made available for payment. we will payinterest computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. wewill pay interest on the notes on any interest payment date to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the fifteenth day (whether or not abusiness day)preceding that particular interest payment date. at maturity, we will pay the principal of the notes upon delivery of the notes to the trustee. ifan interest payment date or the scheduled maturity date or any date of earlier redemption for the notes is not a \"business day,\" we will pay interest, premium, if any, and/orprincipal, as the case may be, on the next succeeding business day, but will not pay additional interest. the term \"business s-9 table of contentsday\"means any day other than a saturday or sunday or a day on which applicable law or regulation authorizes or requires banking institutions in the city of new york to close. optional redemption  we may redeem the notes of any series at our option at any time, in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price (the \"redemptionprice\") equal to the sum of:\\x95 the principal amount of the notes of the applicable series being redeemed plus accrued interest on such notes to the redemption date; and  \\x95 the make-whole amount, as defined below, if any, with respect to such notes. ifthe notes of any series are redeemed on or after the applicable par call date (as defined below), the redemption price will not include the make-whole amount. notwithstandingthe foregoing, installments of interest on the notes that are due and payable on an interest payment date falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on suchinterest payment date to the holders thereof as of the close of business on the relevant record date. ifwe have given notice of redemption and have made funds available on the redemption date referred to in the notice for the redemption, the notes of the applicable series called forredemption will cease to bear interest on the redemption date and the holders of those notes from and after the redemption date will be entitled to receive only the payment of the redemption priceupon surrender of those notes in accordance with the notice. wewill give notice of any optional redemption of the notes of the applicable series to holders of those notes, at their addresses, as shown in the security register for the notes, notmore than 45 nor less than 15days prior to the redemption date. the notice of redemption will specify, among other items, the redemption price and the principal amount of the notes held by theholder to be redeemed. ifwe choose to redeem less than all of the notes of any series, we will notify the trustee at least five business days prior to giving notice of redemption, or a shorter period as maybe satisfactory to the trustee, of the aggregate principal amount of such notes to be redeemed and their redemption date. the trustee will select, on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable or bylot or by such other manner it deems fair and appropriate (and in such manner that complies with the requirements of the depositary, if applicable), such notes to be redeemed in part. asused in this prospectus supplement: \"applicablepar call date\" means (i)march15, 2025, for any 2025 notes (the date that is one month prior to the maturity of the 2025 notes), (ii)january15,2030 for any 2030 notes (the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the 2030 notes) and (iii)october15, 2049 for any 2050 notes (the date that is six months prior to thematurity of the 2050 notes). \"make-wholeamount\" means in connection with any optional redemption of the notes, the excess, if any, of:\\x95 the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of each dollar of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest, calculated byus, excluding interest accrued to the date of redemption, that would have been payable in respect of each dollar assuming the notes being redeemed matured on, and that accrued and unpaid interest onsuch notes was payable on, the applicable par call date (determined by discounting, on a semiannual basis, the principal and interest at the reinvestment rate, determined on the third business daypreceding the date notice of the redemption is given, from the respective dates on which the principal and interest would have been payable assuming the notes being redeemed matured on, and thataccrued and unpaid interest on such notes was payable on, the applicable par call date), over s-10 table of contents\\x95 the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed. \"reinvestmentrate\" means the yield on treasury securities at a constant maturity corresponding to the remaining life to maturity (rounded up to the nearest month) of the principal ofthe notes being redeemed as of the date of redemption (which maturity shall be deemed to be the applicable par call date) (the \"treasury yield\"), plus 0.350% in the case of the 2025 notes beingredeemed, 0.350% in the case of the 2030 notes being redeemed and 0.350% in the case of the 2050 notes being redeemed. for purposes of calculating the reinvestment rate, (1)the treasury yieldwill be equal to the arithmetic mean of the yields displayed for each day in the preceding calendar week published in the statistical release for treasury constant maturities with a maturity equal tothe remaining life to maturity of the notes being redeemed (assuming the notes matured on the applicable par call date) and (2)the most recent statistical release published prior to the dateof the applicable determination will be used. however, if no published maturity exactly corresponds to such remaining life, then the treasury yield will be interpolated or extrapolated on astraight-line basis from the arithmetic means of the yields for the next shortest and next longest published maturities. if the format or content of the statistical release changes in a manner thatprecludes determination of the treasury yield in the above manner, then the treasury yield will be determined in the manner that most closely approximates the above manner, as we reasonably determine. \"statisticalrelease\" means the statistical release designated \"h.15\" or any successor publication that is published weekly by the federal reserve system and that reports yields onactively traded united states government securities adjusted to constant maturities, or, if that statistical release or successor publication is not published at the time of any required determinationunder the indenture, then another reasonably comparable index which we will designate. ranking  the notes will be unsecured and will rank equally and pari passu with all of our other unsecuredand unsubordinated indebtedness. certain covenants  certain covenants in the indenture limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to create or permit to exist certainmortgages and other liens, and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. for a description of these covenants, please see \"description of debt securities\\x97limitation on liens\" and\"description of debt securities\\x97limitation on sale and lease-back transactions.\" governing law  the indenture and the notes are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york, without regard to conflicts oflaws principles of such state other than new york general obligations law section5-1401. book-entry, delivery and form  the notes will be issued in book-entry form only. in order to own a beneficial interest in a note, you must be an institution that has anaccount with dtc or have an account with an institution, such as a brokerage firm, that has an account with dtc. this means that we will not issue actual notes or certificates to each beneficialowner. instead, we will issue one or more global securities representing notes and such global security or securities will be held by or on behalf of dtc or its nominee. the beneficial ownershipinterest of each actual purchaser of notes in book-entry form represented by a global note will be recorded on the records of direct participants and indirectparticipants, including the records of clearstream banking,s.a. and euroclear banksa/nv. for a more complete description s-11 table of contentsofbook-entry debt securities, see \"description of debt securities\\x97provisions applicable to both of the indentures\\x97global securities\" in the accompanying prospectus. paymentsof principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the notes represented by a global security will be made in same-day funds to dtc in accordance with arrangements then ineffect between the trustee and dtc. s-12 table of contents     material united states federal income tax considerations        the following is a summary of the material united states federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and dispositionof the notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax considerations. this summary is based on the provisions of the united states internal revenue code of 1986, as amended(the \"code\"), the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the united states internal revenue service (\"irs\") and other applicableauthorities, all as in effect on the date of this document, and all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. we have not sought any ruling from the irs with respect to thestatements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain anychallenge by the irs in the event of litigation. thissummary deals only with beneficial owners of the notes that purchase the notes in this offering at the applicable initial offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectussupplement and that willhold the notes as \"capital assets\" within the meaning of section1221 of the code (generally, property held for investment). this summary does not purport to deal with all aspects of unitedstates federal income taxation that might be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment circumstances or status, nor does it address tax considerations applicable toinvestors that may be subject to special tax rules, such as certain financial institutions, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, s corporations,partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements for united states federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, realestate investment trusts, broker-dealers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies, \"expatriated entities\" subject to section7874 of the code, certain former citizens or residents of theunited states subject to section877 of the code, taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect tothe notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement, and persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax. this summary also does not discuss the notes held as part of ahedge, straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction, or situations in which the \"functional currency\" of a united states holder (as defined below) is not the united states dollar. moreover,the effects of any applicable united states federal estate or gift, state, local or non-united states tax laws and any tax arising under section1411 of the code (the \"medicare\" tax on certaininvestment income) are not discussed. inthe case of a beneficial owner of the notes that is classified as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes, the tax treatment of the notes to a partner of thepartnership generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. if you are a partner of a partnership holding the notes, then you shouldconsult your own tax advisors. thefollowing discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. investors considering the purchase of the notes should consulttheir own tax advisors with respect to the application of the united states federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the united statesfederal estate or gift tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-united states taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty. thediscussion below assumes that any original issue discount (\"oid\") on the notes (that is, any excess of the principal amount of the notes over their issue price), is either zero or deminimis (less than 1/4% of their principal amount multiplied by the maturity of the notes), all within the meaning of the oid treasury regulations. if these conditions are not satisfiedwith respect to the notes and as a result the notes are treated as having been issued with oid, a holder would be required to include oid in income as interest over the term of the note under aconstant yield method. even if a note s-13 table of contentshasonly de minimis oid, the holder must include such oid in income proportionately as principal payments are made on such note. effect of certain contingencies  in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay amounts on the notes in addition to or at different times than the scheduled payments ofstated principal and interest (e.g.,in the circumstances described under \"description of the notes\\x97optional redemption\"). these potential payments may implicate the provisions ofthe treasury regulations relating to \"contingent payment debt instruments.\" one or more contingencies will not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments if, as of the issuedate of the notes, such contingencies, in the aggregate, are considered remote or incidental. although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paymentof such additional amounts does not result in any series of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable treasury regulations. this position is based on ourdetermination that, as of the issue date of the notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable treasuryregulations. ourdetermination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses to the irs on its tax return for the taxable yearduring which it acquires the notes that it is taking a different position. however, our position is not binding on the irs. if the irs takes a contrary position to that described above, then the notesmay be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. in that case, regardless of a holder\\'s regular method of accounting for united states federal income tax purposes, a holder subject to unitedstates federal income taxation may be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate, and to treat any gain realized on the sale, exchange,redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than capital gain. holders of the notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequencesof the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. the remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for united statesfederal income tax purposes. united states holders  the term \"united states holder\" means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for united states federal income taxpurposes:\\x95 an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the united states; \\x95 a corporation created or organized under the laws of the united states, any state thereof or the district of columbia;  \\x95 an estate, the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  \\x95 a trust, if (i)a court within the united states is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more unitedstates persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (ii)in the case of a trust that was treated as a domestic trust under the law in effect before 1997, a validelection is in place under applicable treasury regulations to treat such trust as a domestic trust. payment of stated interest  stated interest on a note generally will be included in the gross income of a united states holder as ordinary income at the time such interestis accrued or received, in accordance with the holder\\'s method of accounting for united states federal income tax purposes.s-14 table of contentssale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes  upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, a united states holder generally will recognize gain orloss equal to the difference between (i)the amount realized upon the disposition and (ii)the holder\\'s adjusted tax basis in the note. the amount realized will be equal to the sum ofthe amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the note (less any portion allocable to any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxed as ordinary interestincome to the extent not previously so taxed). a united states holder\\'s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal the cost of the note to such holder. this gain or loss generally will becapital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the united states holder has held the note for more than one year. in general, long-term capital gains of a non-corporate unitedstates holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. united states holders should consult their own taxadvisors as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances. information reporting and backup withholding tax  in general, we must report certain information to the irs with respect to payments to certain non-corporate united states holders of principal,premium, if any, and interest on a note, and payments of the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of a note to certain united states holders. the payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor)will be required to impose backup withholding tax, currently at a rate of 24percent, if (i)the payee fails to furnish a correct taxpayer identification number (\"tin\") to the payor orto establish an exemption from backup withholding tax, (ii)the irs notifies the payor that the tin furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii)there has been a notified payeeunderreporting described in section3406(c) of the code or (iv)the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct tin and that the irs has notnotified the payee that it is subject to backup withholding tax under the code. united states backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. any amounts withheld under the backup withholding taxrules from a payment to a united states holder will be allowed as a credit against the holder\\'s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that therequired information is timely furnished to the irs. non-united states holders  the term \"non-united states holder\" means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for united states federal income taxpurposes:\\x95 a nonresident alien individual; \\x95 a foreign corporation; or \\x95 a foreign estate or trust. thefollowing discussion applies only to non-united states holders, and assumes that no item of income, gain, deduction or loss derived by the non-united states holder in respect of thenotes at any time is effectively connected with the conduct of a united states trade or business. special rules, not discussed herein, may apply to certain non-united states holders, suchas:\\x95 certain former citizens or residents of the united states; \\x95 controlled foreign corporations; \\x95 passive foreign investment companies; \\x95 corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid united states federal income tax; \\x95 investors in pass-through entities that are subject to special treatment under the code; and s-15 table of contents\\x95 non-united states holders that are engaged in the conduct of a united states trade or business. payment of interest  subject to the discussions on backup withholding tax and fatca below, interest paid on a note by us or any paying agent to a non-united statesholder will be exempt from united states income and withholding tax under the \"portfolio interest exemption\" provided that (i)the non-united states holder does not,

form) has been received by it from the non-united states holder or a qualifying intermediary and furnishes a copy to us or our agent. this certification requirement may be satisfiedwith other documentary evidence in the case of a note held in an offshore account or through certain foreign intermediaries. ifa non-united states holder cannot satisfy the requirements of the portfolio interest exemption described above, payments of interest made to such holder generally will be subject tounited states withholding tax at the rate of 30percent, unless the holder provides us or our agent with a properly executed irs formw-8ben or w-8ben-e (or other applicable form)establishing an exemption from or reduction of the withholding tax under the benefit of an applicable tax treaty. sale,

generally will be subject to united states federal income tax at a flat rate of 30percent (unless a lower applicable treaty rate applies) on any such realized gain, which may beoffset by certain united states-source capital losses. information reporting and backup withholding tax  the amount of interest paid to a non-united states holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from such payment generally must be reportedannually to the non-united states holder and to the irs. the irs may make this information available under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty to the tax authorities in the country inwhich the non-united states holder is resident. s-16 table of contentsprovidedthat a non-united states holder has complied with certain reporting procedures (usually satisfied by providing a properly completed irs formw-8ben or w-8ben-e) orotherwise establishes an exemption, the non-united states holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding tax with respect to interest payments on, and the proceeds from the disposition of,a note, unless we or our paying agent know or have reason to know that the holder is a united states person. additional rules relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding taxwith respect to the payment of proceeds from the disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a note are as follows:\\x95 if the proceeds are paid to or through the united states office of a broker, a non-united states holder generally will be subject to backupwithholding tax and information reporting unless the non-united states holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a united states person (usually on an irs formw-8ben orw-8ben-e) or otherwise establishes an exemption. \\x95 if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-united states office of a broker that is not a united states person and does not have certainspecified united states connections (a \"united states related person\"), a non-united states holder will not be subject to backup withholding tax or information reporting.  \\x95 if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-united states office of a broker that is a united states person or a united states related person,a non-united states holder generally will be subject to information reporting (but generally not backup withholding tax) unless the non-united states holder certifies under penalties of perjury thatit is not a united states person (usually on an irs formw-8ben or w-8ben-e) or otherwise establishes an exemption. unitedstates backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. any amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the non-unitedstates holder\\'s united states federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the irs. fatca  under fatca, certain foreign financial institutions (each an \"ffi\"), as that term (or its equivalent) is defined under an intergovernmentalagreement between the united states and a foreign jurisdiction (an \"iga\") or, in the absence of an iga, under fatca generally, including entities such as foreign hedge funds, private equity funds,mutual funds, securitization vehicles and other investment vehicles (regardless of their size), must comply with due diligence, withholding and reporting rules with respect to their owners, accountholders and investors or else bear a 30% withholding tax on certain u.s. source payments made to them. regardless of whether an ffi is acting as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary with respectto the withholdable payment, the fatca withholding tax generally will be imposed on withholdable payments, subject to certain exceptions, unless the ffi (i)has entered into (or is otherwisesubject to) and is complying with an agreement with the internal revenue service (an \"ffi agreement\") or (ii)is required by and is in compliance with applicable foreign law enacted inconnection with an iga, in either case to, among other things, collect and provide to the united states or other relevant tax authorities certain information regarding united states account holders ofsuch institution. in the case of u.s. source payments made to a foreign entity that is not an ffi, the fatca withholding tax generally will be imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless suchentity provides the withholding agent with a certification that it does not have any \"substantial\" united states owners, identifies its \"substantial\" united states owners or is otherwise exempt fromfatca. in certain cases, a \"substantial\" united states owner can mean an owner of any interest in the foreign entity. for these purposes, \"fatca\" means section1471 through 1474 of the code andany regulations or official interpretations thereof (including any revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice or similar guidance issued by the u.s. internal revenue service thereunder as aprecondition to relief or exemption from s-17 table of contentstaxesunder such sections, regulations and interpretations), any ffi agreements, any igas entered into in connection with any of the foregoing and any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules orgenerally accepted practices adopted pursuant to any such iga, and any amendments made to any of the foregoing after the date hereof. generally,if a foreign entity subject to fatca does not comply with applicable fatca diligence and reporting requirements or otherwise provide the withholding agent with the propercertification, \"withholdable payments\" made to such foreign entity will be subject to a 30% withholding tax. for this purpose, withholdable payments are generally u.s.-source payments, such asinterest payments on the notes. under proposed regulations, fatca withholding tax on the gross proceeds from the sale of certain equity or debt instruments (including the notes) of u.s. issuers,scheduled to take effect beginning january1, 2019, has been repealed. in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the internal revenue service provided that taxpayers may rely upon thisrepeal until the issuance of final regulations. subject to the foregoing, fatca withholding tax will apply regardless of whether thepayment would otherwise be exempt from u.s. nonresident withholding tax (e.g.,under the portfolio interest exemption or as capital gain). holdersof the notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of fatca to their investment in the notes. s-18

underwriterdefaults the purchase commitments of non-defaulting underwriters may be increased or the offering of the notes may be terminated. theoffering of the notes by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters\\' right to reject any order in whole or in part. wehave agreed to indemnify the underwriters against liabilities under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or contribute to payments which the underwriters may be required to make inrespect thereof. theunderwriters propose to offer the 2025notes initially at the public offering price on the cover page of this prospectus supplement and to selling group members less aconcession of 0.200% of the principal amount of the 2025notes. the underwriters and selling group members may allow a discount of 0.125% of the principal amount of the 2025notes onsales to other broker-dealers. the underwriters propose to offer the 2030notes initially at the public offering price on the cover page of this prospectus supplement and to selling groupmembers less a concession of 0.300% of the principal amount of the 2030notes. the underwriters and selling group members may allow a discount of 0.175%

expenses, not including the underwriting discounts, for the offering of the notes will be approximately moneytokenmillion. eachseries of notes is a new issue of securities with no established trading market. one or more of the underwriters may make a secondary market for the notes of any series. however,they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue making a secondary market for the notes of any series at any time without notice. no assurance can be given as to the development, maintenance orliquidity of any trading market for the notes of any series. therepresentatives, on behalf of the underwriters, may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance withregulationm under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. \\x95 over-allotment involves sales by the underwriters of the notes of any series in excess of the principal amount of such notes referred to on thecover page of this prospectus supplement, which creates a syndicate short position. \\x95 stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the notes of any series so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specific maximum.  \\x95 syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes of any series in the open market after the distribution of those notes has beencompleted in order to cover syndicate short positions. a short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of such notes inthe open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. \\x95 penalty bids permit the representatives to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when notes originally sold by such syndicatemember are purchased in a stabilizing transaction or a syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions. thesestabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding adecline in the market price of the notes. as a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. these transactions, if commenced, may bediscontinued at any time. delayed settlement  we expect that the delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date specified on the cover page of thisprospectus supplement, which will be the third business day following the date of this prospectus supplement. under rules of the securities and exchange commission, trades in the secondary marketgenerally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to that trade expressly agree otherwise. accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes before the second business dayprior to the closing date specified on the cover page of this prospectus supplement will be required, by virtue of the fact that the normal settlement date for that trade would occur prior to theclosing date for the issuance of the notes, to specify an alternate s-20 table of contentssettlementcycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement, and should consult their own advisors with respect to these matters. other relationships  the underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service

factors  your investment in the securities is subject to certain risks, especially if the securities involve in some way a foreign currency. thisprospectus does not describe all of the risks of an investment in the securities, whether arising because the securities are payable in a currency other than u.s. dollars or because the return on thesecurities is linked to one or more interest rates or currency indices or formulas. you should consult your own financial and legal advisors about the risks entailed by an investment in the securitiesand the suitability of your investment in the securities in light of your particular circumstances. foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities are not an appropriate investment forinvestors who are unsophisticated with respect to foreign currency transactions or transactions involving the type of index or formula used to determine amounts payable. non-u.s. residents shouldconsult their own legal and financial advisors with regard to these matters. you should also consider carefully the matters described below, as well as the other factors described in deere&company\\'s safe harbor statements and under \"risk factors\" included or incorporated by reference in its most recent annual report on form10-k and subsequent quarterly reports onform10-q filed with the securities and exchange commission (the \"sec\"). in this prospectus, unless the context otherwise requires, we will use the terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ourselves\" and \"us\" tomean each of deere& company and john deere fundings.a., as applicable, as issuers of the securities described herein. exchange rates and exchange controls may adversely affect your foreign currency securities or currencyindexed securities  if you invest in foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities, there will be significant risks not associated with investments indebt instruments denominated in u.s. dollars or u.s. dollar based indices. these risks include the possibility of significant changes in the rate of exchange between the u.s. dollar and your paymentor indexed currency and the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls by either the united states or the applicable foreign governments. we have no control over the factors thatgenerally affect these risks, such as economic, financial and political events and the supply and demand for the applicable currencies. in recent years, rates of exchange between the u.s. dollar andcertain foreign currencies have been volatile and this volatility may continue in the future. past fluctuations in any particular exchange rate are not necessarily indicative, however, of fluctuationsthat may occur in the future. fluctuations in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar could result in a decrease in the u.s. dollar-equivalent yield of your foreign currency securities or currencyindexed securities, in the u.s. dollar-equivalent value of the principal or any premium payable at maturity of your securities and, generally, in the u.s. dollar-equivalent market value of yoursecurities. the currency risks with respect to your foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities may be further described in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet. foreignexchange rates can either float or be fixed by sovereign governments. governments, however, often do not voluntarily allow their currencies to float freely in response toeconomic forces. instead, governments use a variety of techniques, such as intervention by that country\\'s central bank, or the imposition of regulatory controls or taxes, to affect the exchange rateof their currencies. governments may also issue a new currency to replace an existing currency or alter the exchange rate or relative exchange characteristics by the devaluation or revaluation of acurrency. thus, an important risk in purchasing foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities for u.s. dollar based investors is that their u.s. dollar-equivalent yields could be affectedby governmental actions that could change or interfere with currency valuation that was previously freely determined, fluctuations in response to other market forces and the movement of currenciesacross borders. there will be no adjustment or change in the terms of the foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities if exchange rates become fixed, or if any devaluation orrevaluation or imposition of exchange or other 1 table of contentsregulatorycontrols or taxes occur, or other developments affecting the u.s. dollar or any applicable currency occur. thepaying agent will make all calculations relating to your foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities. all of these determinations will, in the absence of clear error,be binding on holders of the securities. anyprospectus supplement or term sheet relating to securities with an applicable currency other than u.s. dollars will contain information concerning historical exchange rates for thatcurrency against the u.s. dollar and a brief description of any relevant exchange controls. there may be risks associated with foreign currency judgments  the indentures and the securities referred to in this prospectus will be, except to the extent described in a prospectus supplement or termsheet, governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of new york. an action based upon an obligation payable in a currency other than u.s. dollars may be brought in courts inthe united states. however, courts in the united states have not customarily rendered judgments for money damages denominated in any currency other than u.s. dollars. in addition, it is not clearwhether, in granting a judgment, the rate of conversion would be determined with reference to the date of default, the date judgment is rendered or any other date. the judiciary law of the state ofnew york provides, however, that an action based upon an obligation payable in a currency other than u.s. dollars will be rendered in the foreign currency of the underlying obligation and convertedinto u.s. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on the date the judgment or decree is entered. in these cases, holders of foreign currency securities would bear the risk of exchange ratefluctuations between the time the amount of judgment is calculated and the time the foreign currency was converted into u.s. dollars and paid to the holders. youshould consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks entailed by an

reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or to have otherconsequences which cannot be predicted. any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any debt securities linked to such a \"benchmark,\" and could, among other things, reduce thepayments on those debt securities. enforcement of liabilities with respect to john deere

series. this section summarizes the material terms of the debt securities that are commonto all series. most of the financial terms and other specific material terms of any series of debt securities that we offer will be described in a prospectus supplement or term sheet to be attached tothe front of this prospectus. furthermore, since the terms of specific debt securities may differ from the general information we have provided below, you should rely on information in the prospectussupplement or term sheet that contradicts different information below. asrequired by federal law for all bonds and notes of companies that are publicly offered, the debt securities are governed by a document called an \"indenture.\" an indenture is acontract between us and a financial institution acting as trustee on your behalf. the trustee has two main roles. first, the trustee can enforce your rights against us if we default. there are somelimitations on the extent to which the trustee acts on your behalf, described in the second paragraph under \"events of default\\x97remedies if an event of default occurs.\" second, the trusteeperforms certain administrative duties for us. seniorand subordinated securities will be issued by deere& company under an indenture dated as of september25, 2008, as supplemented from time to time (the \"deereindenture\"), between deere& company and the bank of new york mellon, trustee (the \"trustee\"). guaranteed debt securities will be issued by john deere fundings.a. under an indenture,dated as of september25, 2008, as supplemented from time to

to and governed by the trust indenture act of 1939, as amended (the \"tia\"). becausethis section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the debt securities and the indentures. we urge you to read the indenture that governs your debt securitiesbecause it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of debt securities. for example, in this section, we use capitalized words to signify terms that are specifically defined in theindentures. some of the definitions are repeated in this prospectus, but for the rest you will need to read the indentures. the form of each indenture is filed as an exhibit to this registrationstatement. general  each series of debt securities will be unsecured obligations of deere& company or john deere fundings.a., as applicable. thesenior securities and the guaranteed debt securities will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of deere& company or john deere fundings.a., asapplicable. the

under each of the deere indenture or the guaranteed debtindenture, when a single trustee is acting for all debt securities issued under each of the deere indenture or the guaranteed debt indenture, are called the \"indenture securities.\" each indenture alsoprovides that there may be more than one trustee thereunder, each with respect to one or more different series of indenture securities. see \"\\x97resignation of trustee\" below. at a time whentwo or more trustees are acting under either indenture, each with respect to only certain series, the term \"indenture securities\" means the one or more series of debt securities with respect to whicheach respective trustee is acting. in the event that there is more than one trustee under either indenture, the powers and trust obligations of each trustee described in this prospectus will extendonly to the one or more series of indenture securities for which it is trustee. if two or more trustees are acting under either indenture, then the indenture securities for which each trustee isacting would be treated as if issued under separate indentures. theindentures do not contain any provisions that give you protection in the event we issue a large amount of debt or we are acquired by another entity. werefer you to the prospectus supplement or term sheet for information with respect to any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the events of default or our covenants thatare described below, including any addition of a covenant or other provision providing event risk or similar protection. wehave the ability to issue

political subdivision or tax authority thereof or therein) to be included in the income for tax purposes of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of suchpartnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the holder of such guaranteed debt security. theprospectus supplement or term sheet will describe any additional circumstances under which additional amounts will not be paid with respect to guaranteed debt securities. optional tax redemption  unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, except in the case of guaranteed debt securities that have avariable rate of interest and that may beredeemed on any interest payment date, john deere fundings.a. may redeem each series of guaranteed debt securities at its option in whole but not in part at any time,if:\\x95 john deere fundings.a. would be required to pay additional amounts, as a result of any change in the tax laws of the united states orluxembourg, or any jurisdiction in which a successor to john deere fundings.a. is organized, that becomes effective on or after the date of issuance of that series, as explained above under\"payment of additional amounts with respect to the guaranteed debt securities,\" or \\x95 as a result of any change in any treaty affecting taxation to which luxembourg, or any jurisdiction in which a successor to john deerefundings.a. is organized, is a party that becomes effective on or after a date on which deere& company or an affiliate or subsidiary thereof borrows money from john deerefundings.a., deere& company or such affiliate or subsidiary thereof would be required to deduct or withhold tax on any payment to john deere fundings.a. to enable it to makeany payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest. exceptin the case of outstanding original issue discount guaranteed debt securities, which may be redeemed at the redemption price specified by the terms of that series of guaranteeddebt securities, the redemption price will be equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. inboth of these cases, however, we will not be permitted to redeem a series of guaranteed debt securities if we can avoid either the payment of additional amounts, or deductions orwithholding, as the case may be, by using reasonable commercial measures available to us. provisions applicable to both of the indentures  issuance of securities in registered form  we may issue the debt securities in registered form, in which case we may issue them either in book-entry only form or in \"certificated\" form.debt securities issued in book-entry only form will be represented by global securities. we expect that we will usually issue debt securities in book-entry only form represented by global securities.the trustee shall maintain a register of the securities that are issued at its offices. a duplicate register of the trustee\\'s register for the guaranteed debt securities will be maintained by johndeere fundings.a. at its registered office and shall be amended or updated each time the register maintained by the trustee is amended or updated. in case of discrepancy between the tworegisters, the register held at the registered office of john deere fundings.a. shall prevail. wealso will have the option of issuing debt securities in non-registered form as bearer securities if we issue the securities outside the united states to non-u.s. persons. in thatcase, the prospectus supplement or term sheet will set forth the mechanics for holding the bearer securities, including the procedures for receiving payments, for exchanging the bearer securities forregistered securities of the 13 table of contentssameseries, and for receiving notices. the prospectus supplement or term sheet will also describe the requirements with respect to our maintenance of offices or agencies outside the united states andthe applicable u.s. federal tax law requirements. book-entry holders.we will issue registered debt securities in book-entry only form, unless we specify otherwise in theapplicable prospectussupplement or term sheet. this means debt securities will be represented by one or more global securities registered in the name of a depositary that will hold them on behalf of financial institutionsthat participate in the depositary\\'s book-entry system. these participating institutions, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the debt securities held by the depositary or its nominee. theseinstitutions may hold these interests on behalf of themselves or customers. undereach indenture, only the person in whose name a debt security is registered is recognized as the holder of that debt security. consequently, for debt securities issued in globalform, we will recognize only the depositary as the holder of the debt securities and we will make all payments on the debt securities to the depositary. the depositary will then pass along thepayments it receives to its participants, which in turn will pass the payments along to their customers who are the beneficialowners. the depositary and its participants do so under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers; they are not obligated to do so under the terms of the debt securities. asa result, investors will not own debt securities directly. instead, they will own beneficial interests in a global security, through a bank, broker or other financial institution thatparticipates in the depositary\\'s book-entry system or holds an interest through a participant. as long as the debt securities are issued in global form, investors will be indirect holders, and notholders, of the debt securities.  street name holders.in the future, we may issue debt securities in certificated form or terminate a global security. in thesecases, investors maychoose to hold their debt securities in their own names or in \"street name.\" debt securities held in street name are registered in the name of a bank, broker or other financial institution chosen bythe investor, and the investor would hold a beneficial interest in those debt securities through the account he or she maintains at that institution. fordebt securities held in street name, we will recognize only the intermediary banks, brokers and other financial institutions in whose names the debt securities are registered as theholders of those debt securities and we will make all payments on those debt securities to them. these institutions will pass along the payments they receive to their customers who are the beneficialowners, but only because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. investors who hold debt securities in street name will be indirect holders, andnot holders, of the debt securities. legal holders.our obligations, as well as the obligations of the applicable trustee and those of any third parties employed byus or the applicabletrustee, run only to the legal holders of the debt securities. we do not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global securities, in street name or by any other indirectmeans. this will be the case whether an investor chooses to be an indirect holder of a debt security or has no choice because we are issuing the debt securities only in global form. forexample, once we make a payment or give a notice to the holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment or notice even if that holder is required, under agreements withdepositary participants or customers or by law, to pass it along to the indirect holders but does not do so. similarly, if we want to obtain the approval of the holders for any purpose (for example,to amend an indenture or to relieve us of the consequences of a default or of our obligation to comply with a particular provision of an indenture), we would seek the approval only from the holders,and not the indirect holders, of the debt securities. whether and how the holders contact the indirect holders is up to the holders. 14 table of contentswhenwe refer to you, we mean those who invest in the debt securities being offered by this prospectus, whether they are the holders or only indirect holders of those debt securities.when we refer to your debt securities, we mean the debt securities in which you hold a direct or indirect interest.  special considerations for indirect holders.if you hold debt securities through a bank, broker or other financial institution,either in book-entryonly form or in street name, we urge you to check with that institution to find out:\\x95 how it handles securities payments and notices; \\x95 whether it imposes fees or charges; \\x95 how it would handle a request for the indirect holder\\'s consent, if ever required; \\x95 whether and how you can instruct it to send you debt securities registered in your own name so you can be a holder, if that is permitted in thefuture for a particular series of debt securities; \\x95 how it would exercise rights under the debt securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for holders to act to protecttheir interests; and \\x95 if the debt securities are in book-entry only form, how the depositary\\'s rules and procedures will affect these matters. global securities  what is a global security? as noted above, we usually will issue debt securities as registeredsecurities in book-entry only form. a global security represents one or any other number of individual debt securities. generally, all debt securities represented by the same global securities willhave the same terms. eachdebt security issued in book-entry only form will be represented by a global security that we deposit with and register in the name of a financial institution or its nominee that weselect. the financial institution that we select for this purpose is called the depositary. unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, the depository trustcompany, new york, new york, known as dtc, will be the depositary for all debt securities issued in book-entry only form. aglobal security may not be transferred to or registered in the name of anyone other than the depositary or its nominee, unless special termination situations arise. we describe thosesituations below under \"special situations when a global security will be terminated.\" as a result of these arrangements, the depositary, or its nominee, will be the sole registered owner and holderof all debt securities represented by a global security, and investors will be permitted to own only beneficial interests in a global security. beneficial interests must be held by means of an accountwith a broker, bank or other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary or with another institution that has an account with the depositary. thus, an investor whose securityis represented by a global security will not be a holder of the debt security, but only an indirect holder of a beneficial interest in the global security.  special considerations for global securities.as an indirect holder, an investor\\'s rights relating to a global security will begoverned by theaccount rules of the investor\\'s financial institution and of thedepositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. the depositary that holds the global security will be considered the holder of the debt securities represented by the globalsecurity. 15 table of contentsifdebt securities are issued only in the form of a global security, an investor should be aware of the following:\\x95 an investor cannot cause the debt securities to be registered in his or her name, and cannot obtain non-global certificates for his or herinterest in the debt securities, except in the special situations we describe below. \\x95 an investor will be an indirect holder and must look to his or her own bank or broker for payments on the debt securities and protection of hisor her legal rights relating to the debt securities, as we describe under \"issuance of securities in registered form\" above. \\x95 an investor may not be able to sell interests in the debt securities to some insurance companies and other institutions that are required bylaw to own their securities in non-book-entry only form. \\x95 an investor may not be able to pledge his or her interest in a global security in circumstances where certificates representing the debtsecurities must be delivered to the lender or other beneficiary of the pledge in order for the pledge to be effective. \\x95 the depositary\\'s policies, which may change from time to time, will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to aninvestor\\'s interest in a global security. we and the trustee have no responsibility for any aspect of the depositary\\'s actions or for its records of ownership interests in a global security. we andthe trustee also do not supervise the depositary in any way. \\x95 if less than all the debt securities are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee will select debt securities to be redeemed on a pro rata basisor by any other method the trustee deems fair and appropriate. \\x95 an investor is required to give notice of exercise of any option to elect repayment of its debt securities, through its participant, to theapplicable trustee and to deliver the related debt securities by causing its participant to transfer its interest in those debt securities, on dtc\\'s records, to the applicable trustee.  \\x95 dtc requires that those who purchase and sell interests in a global security deposited in its book-entry system use immediately availablefunds. your broker or bank may also require you to use immediately available funds when purchasing or selling interests in a global security. \\x95 financial institutions that participate in the depositary\\'s book-entry system, and through which an investor holds its interest in a globalsecurity, may also have their own policies affecting payments, notices and other matters relating to the debt securities. there may be more than one financial intermediary in the chain of ownershipfor an investor. we do not monitor and are not responsible for the actions of any of those intermediaries.  special situations when a global security will be terminated.in a few special situations described below, a global securitywill be terminated andinterests in it will be exchanged for certificates in non-global form (certificated securities). after that exchange, the choice of whether to hold the certificated debt securities directly or instreet name will be up to the investor. investors must consult their own banks or brokers to find out how to have their interests in a global security transferred on termination to their own names, sothat they will be holders. we have described the rights of holders and street name investors under \"issuance of securities in registered form\" above. thespecial situations for termination of a global security are as follows:\\x95 if the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling, unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary for that global security, and we donot appoint another institution to act as depositary within 60days; 16 table of contents\\x95 if we notify the trustee that we wish to terminate that global security (subject to dtc\\'s procedures); or  \\x95 if an event of default has occurred with regard to the debt securities represented by that global security and has not been cured or waived; wediscuss defaults later under \"events of default.\" theprospectus supplement or term sheet may list situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the particular series of debt securities covered by the prospectussupplement or term sheet. if a global security is terminated, only the depositary, and not we or the applicable trustee, is responsible for deciding the institutions in whose names the debt securitiesrepresented by the global security will be registered and, therefore, who will be the holders of those debt securities. payment and paying agents  we will pay interest to the person listed in the applicable trustee\\'s records as the owner of the debt security at the close of business on aparticular day in advance of each due date for interest, even if that person no longer owns the debt security on the interest due date. that day, usually about two weeks in advance of the interest duedate, is called the \"record date.\" because we will pay all the interest for an interest period to the holders on the record date, holders buying and selling debt securities must work out betweenthemselves the appropriate purchase price. the most common manner is to adjust the sales price of the debt securities to prorate interest fairly between buyer and seller based on their respectiveownership periods within the particular interest period. this prorated interest amount is called \"accrued interest.\" exceptas set forth in the indentures and as described below under \"\\x97defeasance\\x97covenant defeasance\" and \"\\x97defeasance\\x97full defeasance,\"upon deposit of payment in full with the trustee or paying agent for the benefit of the holders of such securities, our payment obligations with respect to the debt securities of such series areextinguished, regardless of whether the trustee\\'s or paying agent\\'s payment to holders is thereafter prohibited or otherwise restricted. payments on global securities.we will make payments on a global security in accordance with the applicable policies of thedepositary as in effectfrom time to time. under those policies, we will make payments directly to the depositary, or its nominee, and not to any indirect holders who own beneficial interests in the global security. anindirect holder\\'s right to those payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depositary and its participants, as described under \"global securities\\x97what is a globalsecurity?\"  payments on certificated securities.we will make payments on a debt security in non-global certificated form as follows. wewill pay interest thatis due on an interest payment date (as defined below) by check mailed on the interest payment date to the holder at his or her address shown on the applicable trustee\\'s records as of the close ofbusiness on the regular record date (defined below). we will make all payments of principal and premium, if any, by check at the office of the applicable trustee in new york, ny and/or at otheroffices that may be specified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet or in a notice to holders, against surrender of the debt security. alternatively,if the holder asks us to do so, we will pay any amount that becomes due on the debt security by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account at a bank in thecity of new york on the due date. to request payment by wire, the holder must give the applicable trustee or otherpaying agent appropriate transfer instructions at least 15 business days before the requested wire payment is due. in the case of any interest payment due on an interest payment date, the instructionsmust be given by the person who is the holder on the relevant regular record date. any wire instructions, once properly given, will remain in effect unless and until new instructions are given in themanner described above. 17  table of contents  payment when offices are closed.if any payment is due on a debt security on a day that is not a business day, we will make thepayment on the nextday that is a business day. payments made on the next business day in this situation will be treated under the indentures as if they were made on the original due date, except as otherwise indicatedin the attached prospectus supplement or term sheet. such payment will not result in a default under any debt security or indenture, and no interest will accrue on the payment amount from the originaldue date to the next day that is a business day. book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debtsecurities.optional redemption, repayment and repurchase  the prospectus supplement or term sheet for a debt security will indicate whether deere& company or john deere fundings.a. willhave the option to redeem the debt security issued by it before the stated maturity and the price and date(s) or period(s) on which or during which redemption may occur. if we are allowed to redeem adebt security, we may exercise the option by notifying the trustee and the paying agent at least 60days prior to the redemption date. at least 30 but not more than 60days before theredemption date, the trustee will mail notice or cause the paying agent to mail notice of redemption to the holders. if a debt security is only redeemed in part, we will issue a new debt security ordebt securities for the unredeemed portion. unlessotherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, any right granted to john deere fundings.a. to optionally redeem a debt security issued by itwill be in addition to its right to redeem a debt security in the event certain tax events occur, to the extent set forth above under \"\\x97optional tax redemption.\" theprospectus supplement or term sheet relating to a debt security will also indicate whether you will have the option to elect repayment by the applicable issuer prior to the statedmaturity and the price and the date(s) or period(s) on which or during which repayment may occur. fora debt security to be repaid at your election, we must receive, at least 30 but not more than 45days prior to an optional repayment date, if, in certificated form, such debtsecurity with the form entitled \"option to elect repayment\" on the reverse of the debt security duly completed. you may also send the paying agent a facsimile or letter from a member of a nationalsecurities exchange or the financial industry regulatory authority (\"finra\") or a commercial bank or trust company in the united states describing the particulars of the repayment, including aguarantee that the debt security and the form entitled \"option to elect repayment\" will be received by the paying agent no later than five business days after such facsimile or letter. if you presenta debt security for repayment, such act will be irrevocable. you may exercise the repayment option for less than the entire principal of the debt security, provided the remaining principal outstandingis an authorized denomination. if you elect partial repayment, your debt security will be cancelled, and we will issue a new debt security or debt securities for the remaining amount. dtcor its nominee will be the holder of each global security and will be the only party that can exercise a right of repayment. if you are a beneficial owner of a global security andyou want to exercise your right of repayment, you must instruct your broker or indirect participant through which you hold your interest to notify dtc. you should consult your broker or such indirectparticipant to discuss the appropriate cut-off times and any other requirements for giving this instruction. the giving of any such instruction will be irrevocable. ifa debt security is an original issue discount debt security (\"oid note\") (other than an indexed note, as defined below), the amount payable in the event of redemption or repaymentprior to its stated maturity will be the amortized face amount on the redemption or repayment date, as the case may be. the amortized face amount of an oid note will be equal to (i)the issueprice specified in the 18 table of contentsapplicableprospectus supplement or term sheet plus (ii)that portion of the difference between the issue price and the principal amount of the debt security that has accrued at the yield tomaturity described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet (computed in accordance with generally accepted u.s. bond yield computation principles) by the redemption or repayment date. however, inno case will the amortized face amount of an oid note exceed its principal amount. wemay at any time purchase debt securities at any price in the open market or otherwise. we may hold, resell or surrender for cancellation any debt securities that we purchase. conversion and exchange  if any debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable for other securities, the prospectus supplement or term sheet will explain the termsand conditions of the conversion or exchange, including the conversion price or exchange ratio (or the calculation method), the conversion or exchange period (or how the period will be determined), ifconversion or exchange will be mandatory or at the option of the holder or us, provisions for adjusting the conversion price or the exchange ratio and provisions affecting conversion or exchange inthe event of the redemption of the underlying debt securities. these terms may also include provisions under which the number or amount of other securities to be received by the holders of the debtsecurities upon conversion or exchange would be calculated according to the market price of the other securities as of a time stated in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. interest and interest rates  general  each debt security will begin to accrue interest from the date it is originally issued or from a specified date. the related prospectussupplement or term sheet will specify each debt security as a fixed rate note, a floating rate note, an amortizing note or an indexed note and set forth the interest rate or describe the method ofdetermining the interest rate, including any spread and/or spread multiplier. for an indexed note, the related prospectus supplement or term sheet also will describe the method for the calculation andpayment of principal and interest. the prospectus supplement or term sheet for a floating rate note or indexed note may also specify a maximum and a minimum interest rate. unless otherwise specifiedin the related prospectus supplement or term sheet, the minimum interest rate for each relevant interest reset period on a floating rate note shall be zero percent. adebt security may be issued as a fixed rate note or a floating rate note or as a note that combines fixed and floating rate terms. eachinterest payment on a debt security will include interest accrued from, and including, the issue date, a specified date or the last interest payment date, as the case may be, to butexcluding the applicable interest payment date or the maturity date (as defined below), as the case may be. intereston the debt securities denominated in u.s. dollars will be paid by check mailed on an interest payment date other than a maturity date to the persons entitled thereto at theaddresses of such holders as they appear in the security register or, at our option, by wire transfer to a bank account maintained by the holder. the principal of, premium, if any, and interest ondebt securities denominated in u.s. dollars, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon, due on the maturity date will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such debtsecurities at the corporate trust office of the applicable trustee in the city of new york, or,

the particular bank has appropriate facilities toreceive these payments and the particular debt security is presented and 19 table of contentssurrenderedat the office or agency maintained by us for this purpose in the city of new york, in time for the trustee to make these payments in accordance with its normal procedures. fixed rate notes  the prospectus supplement or term sheet for debt securities with a fixed interest rate (\"fixed rate notes\") will specify a fixed interest ratepayable semiannually in arrears on dates specified in such prospectus supplement or term sheet (each, with respect to fixed rate notes, an \"interest payment date\"). unless otherwise specified in aprospectus supplement or term sheet, interest on fixed rate notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. if the stated maturity date, any redemption date or anyrepayment date (together referred to as the \"maturity date\") or an interest payment date for any fixed rate note is not a business day, principal of, premium, if any, and interest on that note will bepaid on the next business day, and no interest will accrue from and after the maturity date or interest payment date on the payment so deferred. interest on fixed rate notes will be paid to holders ofrecord as of each regular record date. unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement or term sheet, a \"regular record date\" will be the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a business day)preceding the applicable interest payment date. original issue discount notes  we may issue oid notes (including zero coupon debt securities), which are debt securities issued at a discount from the principal amount payableon the maturity date. there may not be any periodic interest payments on oid notes. for oid notes, interest normally accrues during the life of the note and is paid on the maturity date. upon aredemption, repayment or acceleration of the maturity of an oid note, the amount payable will be determined as set forth under \"\\x97optional redemption, repayment and repurchase.\" this amountnormally is less than the amount payable on the stated maturity date. amortizing notes  we may issue amortizing debt securities, which are fixed rate notes for which combined principal and interest payments are made in installmentsover the life of each debt security (\"amortizing notes\"). payments on amortizing notes are applied first to interest due and then to the reduction of the unpaid principal amount. the relatedprospectus supplement or term sheet for an amortizing note will include a table setting forth repayment information. floating rate notes  each debt security whose interest is determined by reference to an interest rate basis or formula is referred to herein as a \"floating ratenote.\" that basis or formula may be based on:\\x95 the commercial paper rate; \\x95 libor; \\x95 euribor; \\x95 the federal funds rate; \\x95 the prime rate; \\x95 the treasury rate; \\x95 the cmt rate; \\x95 the eleventh district cost of funds rate; or 20 table of contents\\x95 another negotiated interest rate basis or formula. theprospectus supplement or term sheet will also indicate any spread and/or spread multiplier, which would be applied to the interest rate formula to determine the interest rate. anyfloating rate note may have a maximum or minimum interest rate limitation. in addition to any maximum interest rate limitation, the interest rate on the floating rate notes will in no event be higherthan the maximum rate permitted by new york law, as the same may be modified by united states law of general application. wewill appoint a calculation agent to calculate interest rates on the floating rate notes. unless we identify a different party in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, the payingagent will be the calculation agent for each note. unlessotherwise specified in a prospectus supplement or term sheet, the \"calculation date,\" if applicable, relating to an interest determination date will be the earlier of(i)the tenth calendar dayafter such interest determination date or, if such day is not a business day, the next succeeding business day, or (ii)the business day immediately preceding the relevant interest payment dateor the maturity date, as the case may be. uponthe request of the beneficial holder of any floating rate note, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if different, when available, the interestrate that will become effective on the next interest reset date (as defined below) for the floating rate note.  change of interest rate.the interest rate on each floating rate note may be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually,annually or onsome other specified basis. this period is an \"interest reset period\" and the first day of each interest reset period is an \"interest reset date.\" unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplementor term sheet,

effective until the following interestreset date. thereafter, the interest rate will be the rate determined on each interest determination date. each time a new interest rate is determined, it becomes effective on the following interestreset date. if any interest reset date is not a business day, then the interest reset date is postponed to the next business day, except, in the case of libor and euribor notes, if the next businessday is in the next calendar month, the interest reset date is the immediately preceding business day.  date interest rate is determined.the interest determination date for all cmt rate notes is the second business day before the interestreset dateand for all libor notes will be the second london business day immediately preceding the applicable interest reset

the second target business day immediately preceding the applicable interest reset date. theinterest determination date for treasury rate notes will be the day of the week in which the interest reset date falls on which treasury bills of the index maturity are normallyauctioned. the \"index maturity\" is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation with respect to which the related interest rate basis or formula will be calculated. treasury bills areusually sold at auction on monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held ontuesday. sometimes, the auction is held on the preceding friday. if an auction is held on the preceding friday, that day will be the interest determination date relating to the interest reset dateoccurring in the next week. theinterest determination date for all commercial paper rate, federal funds rate and prime rate notes will be the first business day preceding the interest reset date.

business on each regular recorddate, which is the fifteenth day (whether or not a business day) next preceding the applicable interest payment date, unless the issue date falls after a regular record date and on or prior to therelated interest payment date, in which case payment will be made to holders of record at the close of business on the regular record date next preceding the second interest payment date following theissue date. if an interest payment date (but not the maturity date) is not a business day then the interest payment date will be postponed to the next business day. however, in the case of libor andeuribor notes, if the next business day is in the next calendar month, the interest payment date will be the immediately preceding business day. if the maturity date of any floating rate note is not abusiness day, principal of, premium, if any, and interest on that note will be paid on the next business day, and no interest will accrue from and after the maturity date on the payment so deferred. accruedinterest on a floating rate note is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a note by an accrued interest factor. the accrued interest factor is the sum of the interestfactors 22 table of contentscalculatedfor each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. the interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day by (1)theactual number of days in the year, in the case of treasury rate notes or cmt rate notes, or (2)360, in the case of other floating rate notes. the interest factor for floating rate notes forwhich the interest rate is calculated with reference to two or more interest rate bases will be calculated in each period in the same manner as if only one of the applicable interest rate basesapplied. all percentages resulting from any calculation are rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. forexample, 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). dollar amounts used in the calculation are rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded

rates, or a composite or baskets of any or all of the above. examples of indexed items that may be used include a published stock index, the common stock price of a publiclytraded company, the value of the u.s. dollar versus the japanese yen, or the price of a barrel of west texas intermediate crude oil. ifyou purchase an indexed note, you may receive a principal amount at maturity that is greater than or less than the note\\'s face amount, and an interest rate that is greater than orless than the interest rate that you would have earned if you had instead purchased a conventional debt security issued by us at the same time with the same maturity. the amount of interest andprincipal that you will receive will depend on the structure of the indexed note and the level of the specified indexed item throughout the term of the indexed note and at maturity. specificinformation pertaining to the method of determining the interest payments and the principal amount will be described in

extension for less than all of its renewable notes only if the terms of the renewable note specifically permit partial termination. an election to terminate the automatic extension of anyportion of the renewable note is not revocable and will be binding on the holder of the renewable note. if the holder elects to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of the note, theholder will become entitled to the principal and interest accrued up to the renewal date. the related prospectus supplement or term sheet will identify a stated maturity date beyond which the maturitydate cannot be renewed. ifa renewable note is represented by a global security, dtc or its nominee will be the holder of the note and therefore will be the only entity that can exercise a right to terminatethe automatic extension of a note. in order to ensure that dtc or its nominee will exercise a right to terminate the automatic extension provisions of a particular renewable note, the beneficial ownerof the note must instruct the broker or other dtc participant through which it holds an interest in the note to notify dtc of its desire to terminate the automatic extension of the note. differentfirms have different cut-off times for accepting instructions from their customers and, accordingly, each beneficial owner should consult the broker or other participant through which it holds aninterest in

than 60days prior tothe then effective maturity date. if we elect to extend the extendible notes, the trustee (or paying agent) will mail (at least 40days prior to the maturity date) to the registered holder ofthe extendible notesa notice (an \"extension notice\") informing the holders of our election, the new maturity date and any updated terms. upon the mailing of the extension notice, the maturityof the extendible notes will be extended automatically as set forth in the extension notice. however,we may, not later than 20days prior to the maturity date of an extendible note (or, if that date is not a business day, prior to the next business day), at our option,establish a higher interest rate, in the case of a fixed rate note, or a higher spread and/or spread multiplier, in the case of a floating rate note, for the extension period by mailing or causing theapplicable trustee (or paying agent) to mail notice of such higher interest rate or higher spread and/or spread multiplier to the holders of the notes. the notice will be irrevocable. ifwe elect to extend the maturity of extendible notes, the holders of the notes will have the option to instead elect repayment of the notes by us on the maturity date in effect priorto such extension, at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus interest accrued to such date. in order for an extendible note to be so repaid on the maturity date, we must receive, at least25days but not more than 35days prior to the maturity date: (1)theextendible note with the form \"option to elect repayment\" on the reverse of the note duly completed; or (2)afacsimile transmission, telex or letter from a member of a national securities exchange or finra or a commercial bank or trust company in the united states settingforth the name of the holder of the extendible note, the principal amount of the note, the principal amount of the note to be repaid, the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms ofthe note, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby and a guarantee that the note be repaid, together with the duly completed form entitled \"option to elect repayment\"on the reverse of the note, will be received by the applicable trustee (or paying agent) not later than the fifth business day after the date of the facsimile transmission, telex or letter;  provided, however, that the facsimile transmission, telex orletter will only be effective if the note and form duly completed are received by the applicable trustee (or paying agent) by that fifth business day. the option may be exercised by the holder of anextendible note for less than the aggregate principal amount of the note then outstanding if the principal amount of the note remaining outstanding after repayment is an authorized denomination. ifan extendible note is represented by a global security, dtc or its nominee will be the holder of that note and therefore will be the only entity that can exercise a right torepayment. to ensure that dtc or its nominee timely exercises a right to repayment with respect to a particular extendible note, the beneficial owner of that note must instruct the broker or otherparticipant through which it holds an interest in the note to notify dtc of its desire to exercise a right of repayment. different firms have different cut-off times for accepting instructions fromtheir customers and, accordingly, each beneficial owner should consult the broker or other participant through which it holds an interest in an 32 table of contentsextendiblenote to determine the cut-off time by which an instruction must be given for timely notice to be delivered to dtc or its nominee. specific information pertaining to united states federalincome tax considerations for the extendible notes will be described in an applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet. events of default  you will have special rights if an event of default occurs in respect of the debt securities of your series and is not cured, as described laterin this subsection. what is an event of default? the term \"event of default\" in respect of the debt securities of your series means any of thefollowing:\\x95 we do not pay the principal of, or any premium, if any, on a debt security of the series when it becomes due and payable at its maturity.  \\x95 we do not pay interest, and in the case of the guaranteed debt securities any additional amounts, on a debt security of the series within30days of its due date. \\x95 we do not deposit any sinking fund payment in respect of debt securities of the series on its due date.  \\x95 we remain in breach of a covenant in respect of debt securities of the series for 60days after we receive a written notice of defaultspecifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied. the notice must be sent by either the trustee or holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of debt securities of the series.  \\x95 in the case of the guaranteed debt securities, the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect or deere& company denies, or givesnotice, that it has no further liability under the guarantee (other than by reason of the termination of the guaranteed debt indenture or the release of such guarantee in accordance with theguaranteed debt indenture), and such condition continues for 30days after we receive a written notice of such default. \\x95 we file for bankruptcy or certain other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur. \\x95 any other event of default in respect of debt securities of the series described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet occurs. anevent of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series of debt securities issued under the same or anyother indenture. the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default, except in the payment of principal, premium or interest, if it considers the withholding of notice tobe in the best interests of the holders.  remedies if an event of default occurs.if an event of default, other than an event of default caused by our filing forbankruptcy or certain otherevents of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurring, has occurred and has not been cured, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities ofthe affected series may declare the entire principal amount (or, if any securities are original issue discount securities or indexed securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified inthe terms thereof) of all the debt securities of that series to be due and immediately payable by a notice in writing to deere& company. this is called a declaration of acceleration ofmaturity. a declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the affected series. exceptin cases of default, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the applicable indenture at the request of any holders unlessthe holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from costs, expenses and liability to be incurred in compliance with 33 table of contentssuchrequest (called an \"indemnity\"). if reasonable indemnity is provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time,method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. the trustee may refuse to follow those directions in certain circumstances. nodelay or omission in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon any event of default will impair any such right or remedy or be treated as a waiver of any such event of default or acquiescencetherein. ifan event of default caused by our filing for bankruptcy or certain other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs and is continuing, then the principal amount of alldebt securities issued under the applicable indenture, together with any accrued interest through the occurrence of such event, shall become and be due and payable immediately, without any declarationor other act by the trustee or any other holder. beforeyou are allowed to bypass your trustee and bring your own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce your rights or protect your interests relating to thedebt securities, the following must occur:\\x95 you must give your trustee written notice that an event of default has occurred and remains uncured.  \\x95 the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of the relevant series must make a written request that thetrustee take action because of the default and must offer reasonable indemnity to the trustee against the cost and other liabilities of taking that action. \\x95 the trustee must not have taken action for 60days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity.  \\x95 the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities must not have given the trustee a direction inconsistent with the abovenotice during that 60-day period. however,you are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on your debt securities on or after the due date. holdersof a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the affected series may waive any past defaults other than:\\x95 the payment of principal, any premium or interest, or \\x95 in respect of a covenant that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder. book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how to give notice or direction to or make a request of the trusteeand how to declare or cancel an acceleration.eachyear, we will furnish to each trustee a written statement of certain of our officers certifying that to their knowledge we are in compliance with the applicable indenture and thedebt securities, or else specifying any default. merger or consolidation  under the terms of the indentures, we are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another entity. we are also permitted to sell all orsubstantially all of our assets to another entity. however, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met:\\x95 where we merge out of existence or sell all or substantially all of our assets, the resulting entity must agree to be legally responsible forthe debt securities. 34  table of contents \\x95 the merger or sale of assets must not cause a default on the debt securities and we must not already be in default (unless the merger or salewould cure the default). for purposes of this no-default test, a default would include an event of default that has occurred and has not been cured, as described above under \"what is an event ofdefault?\" a default for this purpose would also include any event that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving us a notice of default or our default having to exist for a specificperiod of time were disregarded. \\x95 under the deere indenture or the guaranteed debt indenture, no merger or sale of assets may be made if as a result any of our property orassets or any property or assets of one of our restricted subsidiaries would become subject to any mortgage, lien or other encumbrance unless either (i)the mortgage, lien or other encumbrancecould be created pursuant to the limitation on liens covenant in the applicable indenture (see \"\\x97limitation on liens\" below) without equally and ratably securing the indenture securitiesissued under that indenture or (ii)the indenture securities are secured equally and ratably with or prior to the debt secured by the mortgage, lien or other encumbrance.  \\x95 we must deliver certain certificates and documents to the trustee. \\x95 we must satisfy any other requirements specified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to a particular series of debt securities. ifjohn deere fundings.a. is required to pay additional amounts, deere& company or any of its subsidiaries may directly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed anddelivered to the trustee, in form satisfactory to the trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on and any additional amounts with respect to all thedebt securities and the performance or observance of every covenant of the guaranteed debt indenture by john deere fundings.a. upon any such assumption, deere& company or suchsubsidiary shall succeed to, and be substituted for and may exercise every right and power of, john deere fundings.a. under the guaranteed debt indenture with the same effect as ifdeere& company or such subsidiary had been named as john deere fundings.a. therein, and john deere fundings.a. will be released from all obligations and covenants with respectto the debt securities. no such assumption will be permitted unless deere& company has delivered to the guaranteed debt trustee (i)an officers\\' certificate and an opinion of counsel,each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer and such assumption and supplemental indenture comply with the guaranteed debt indenture, and that all conditions precedent thereinprovided for relating to the transaction have been complied with and that, in the event of assumption by a subsidiary, the guarantee and all other covenants of deere& company in the guaranteeddebt indenture remain in full force and effect and (ii)an opinion of independent counsel that the holders of debt securities or related coupons (assuming such holders are only taxed asresidents of the united states) will have no materially adverse united states federal tax consequences as a result of such assumption, and that, if any debt securities are then listed on the new yorkstock exchange, that such debt securities will not be delisted as a result of such assumption. modification or waiver  there are three types of changes we can make to either indenture and the debt securities issued thereunder.  changes requiring your approval.first, there are changes that we cannot make to your debt securities without your specificapproval. following is alist of those types of changes:\\x95 change the stated maturity of, the principal of (or premium, if any, on), interest or any additional amounts on a debt security;  \\x95 reduce the portion of principal of an original issue security or indexed security that would be due and payable upon acceleration of thematurity of a security following a default; 35 table of contents\\x95 adversely affect any right of repayment at the holder\\'s option; \\x95 change the place (except as otherwise described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet) or currency of payment on a debt security;  \\x95 impair your right to sue for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the stated maturity; \\x95 adversely affect any right to convert or exchange a debt security in accordance with its terms; \\x95 modify the subordination provisions in the deere indenture in a manner that is adverse to holders of the subordinated securities;  \\x95 reduce the percentage of holders of debt securities whose consent is needed to modify or amend the applicable indenture;  \\x95 reduce the percentage of holders of debt securities whose consent is needed to waive compliance with certain provisions of the applicableindenture or to waive certain defaults; \\x95 modify any other aspect of the provisions of the applicable indenture dealing with supplemental indentures, modification and waiver of certainpast defaults, changes to the quorum or voting requirements or the waiver of certain covenants; \\x95 in the case of the guaranteed debt securities, change in any manner adverse to holders, the terms and conditions of deere& company\\'sobligations as guarantor to pay principal, premium, if any, interest and any sinking fund with respect to the guaranteed debt securities or change any obligation to pay additional amounts, asexplained above under \"payment of additional amounts with respect to the guaranteed debt securities\"; and \\x95 in the case of the deere indenture, change any obligation we have to pay additional amounts. changes not requiring approval.the second type of change does not require any vote by the holders of the debt securities. thistype is limited toclarifications and certain other changes that would not adversely affect holders of the outstanding debt securities in any material respect. we also do not need any approval to make any change thataffects only debt securities to be issued under either indenture after the change takes effect.  changes requiring majority approval.any other change to either of the indentures and the debt securities would require thefollowingapproval:\\x95 if the change affects only one series of debt securities, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of theoutstanding debt securities of that series; and \\x95 if the change affects more than one series of debt securities issued under the same indenture, it must be approved by the holders of a majorityin principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all of the series affected by the change, with all affected series voting together as one class for this purpose. ineach case, the required approval must be given by written consent. theholders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all of the series affected by noncompliance, voting together as one class for this purpose, may waiveour compliance with some of our covenants in that indenture. however, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or of any of the matters covered by the bullet points included above under\"\\x97changes requiring your approval.\" 36 table of contentsfurther details concerning voting.when taking a vote, we will use the following rules to decide how much principal to attributeto a debtsecurity:\\x95 for original issue discount securities, we will use the principal amount that would be due and payable on the voting date if the maturity ofthese debt securities were accelerated to that date because of a default. \\x95 for debt securities whose principal amount is not known (for example, because it is based on an index), we will use a special rule for thatdebt security described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. \\x95 for debt securities denominated in one or more foreign currencies, we will use the u.s. dollar equivalent. debtsecurities will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not eligible to vote, if we have deposited or set aside in trust money for their payment or redemption. debt securitieswill also not be eligible to vote if they have been fully defeased as described below under \"defeasance\\x97full defeasance.\" wewill generally be entitled to set any date as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding indenture securities that are entitled to vote or take otheraction under the indentures. if we set a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of one or more series, that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders ofoutstanding indenture securities of those series on the record date and must be taken within eleven months following the record date. book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change theapplicable indenture or the debt securities or request a waiver.defeasance  the following provisions will be applicable to each series of debt securities unless we state in the applicable prospectus supplement or termsheet that the provisions of covenant defeasance and full defeasance will not be applicable to that series.  covenant defeasance.under current united states federal tax law, we can make the deposit described below and be released fromsome of therestrictive covenants in the indenture under which the particular series was issued. this is called \"covenant defeasance.\" in that event, you would lose the protection of those restrictive covenantsbut would gain the protection of having money and government securities set aside in trust to repay your debt securities. if you hold subordinated securities, you also would be released from thesubordination provisions described under \"\\x97provisions applicable to the deere indenture\\x97subordination.\" in order to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do thefollowing:\\x95 if the debt securities of the particular series are denominated in u.s. dollars, we must deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders ofsuch debt securities a combination of money and united states government or united states government agency notes or bonds that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any otherpayments on the debt securities on their various due dates. \\x95 we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel confirming that, under current united states federal income tax law and, in thecase of guaranteed debt securities under current tax laws of luxembourg, we may make the above deposit without causing you to be taxed on the debt securities any differently than if we did not makethe deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves at maturity. 37 table of contents\\x95 we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel stating that the above deposit does not require registration of the applicableissuer under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (the \"investment company act\"), and a legal opinion and officers\\' certificate stating that all conditions precedent to covenant defeasancehave been complied with or that all necessary registrations under the investment company act have been effected. \\x95 in the case of the guaranteed debt indenture we must deliver to the trustee an officers\\' certificate stating that any outstanding securitieslisted on any securities exchange will not be delisted as a result of the above deposit. ifwe accomplish covenant defeasance, you can still look to us for repayment of the debt securities if there were a shortfall in the trust deposit or the trustee is prevented from makingpayment. in fact, if one of the remaining events of default occurred (such as our bankruptcy) and the debt securities became immediately due and payable, there might be a shortfall. depending on theevent causing the default, you may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall.  full defeasance.if there is a change in united states federal tax law, as described below, we can legally release ourselvesfrom all payment andother obligations on the debt securities of a particular series (called \"full defeasance\") if we put in place the following other arrangements for you to be repaid:\\x95 if the debt securities of the particular series are denominated in u.s. dollars, we must deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders ofsuch debt securities a combination of money and united states government or united states government agency notes or bonds that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any otherpayments on the debt securities on their various due dates. \\x95 we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming that there has been a change in current united states federal tax law or an internalrevenue service ruling that allows us to make, and, in the case of guaranteed debt securities, under the then existing current tax laws of luxembourg, we may make the above deposit without causing youto be taxed on the debt securities any differently than if we did not make the deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves at maturity. under current united states federal tax law, thedeposit and our legal release from the debt securities would be treated as though we paid you your share of the cash and notes or bonds at the time the cash and notes or bonds were deposited in trustin exchange for your debt securities and you would recognize gain or loss on the debt securities at the time of the deposit. \\x95 we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion stating that the above deposit does not require registration of the applicable issuer under theinvestment company act and a legal opinion and officers\\' certificate stating that all conditions precedent to covenant defeasance have been complied with or that all necessary registrations under theinvestment company act have been effected. \\x95 in the case of the guaranteed debt indenture, we must deliver to the trustee an officers\\' certificate stating that any outstanding securitieslisted on any securities exchange will not be delisted as a result of the above deposit. wemust, in the case of guaranteed debt securities, deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel confirming that under the current tax laws of luxembourg, we may make the abovedeposit without causing you to be taxed on the debt securities any differently than if we did not make the deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves at maturity. ifwe ever did accomplish full defeasance, as described above, you would have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment of the debt securities. you could not look to us forrepayment in the 38 table of contentsunlikelyevent of any shortfall. conversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever became bankrupt or insolvent. if you holdsubordinated securities, you would also be released from the subordination provisions described under \"\\x97provisions applicable to the deere indenture\\x97subordination.\" form, exchange and transfer of registered securities  if registered debt securities cease to be issued in global form, they will be issued:\\x95 only in fully registered certificated form, \\x95 without interest coupons, and \\x95 unless we indicate otherwise in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, in denominations of u.s.moneytoken and amounts that are integral multiplesof u.s.moneytoken holdersmay exchange their certificated securities for debt securities of smaller authorized denominations or combined into fewer debt securities of larger denominations, as long as thetotal principal amount is not changed. holdersmay exchange or transfer their certificated securities at the office of their trustee. we have appointed the trustee to act as our agent for registering debt securities in thenames of holders transferring debt securities. we may appoint another entity to perform these functions or perform them ourselves. holderswill not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange their certificated securities, but they may be required to pay any tax or other governmental chargeassociated with the transfer or exchange. the transfer or exchange will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holder\\'s proof of legal ownership. ifwe have designated additional transfer agents for your debt security, they will be named in your prospectus supplement or term sheet. we may appoint additional transfer agents orcancel the appointment of any particular transfer agent. we may also approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts. ifany certificated securities of a particular series are redeemable and we redeem less than all the debt securities of that series, we may block the transfer or exchange of those debtsecurities during the period beginning 15days before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing, in order to freeze the list of holders to prepare themailing. we may also refuse to register transfers or exchanges of any certificated securities selected for redemption, except that we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemedportion of any debt security that will be partially redeemed. ifa registered debt security is issued in global form, only the depositary will be entitled to transfer and exchange the debt security as described in this subsection, since it will bethe sole holder of the debt security. resignation of trustee  each trustee may resign or be removed with respect to one or more series of indenture securities  provided that a successor trustee isappointed to act with respect to such series. in the event that two or more persons are acting as trustee withrespect to different series of indenture securities under one of the indentures, each of the trustees will be a trustee of a trust separate and apart from the trust administered by any other trustee. 39 table of contentslimitation on liens  we covenant in the indentures that we will not, nor will we permit any restricted subsidiary to, issue, incur, assume or guarantee any debt(\"debt\") if the debt is secured by any mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien or other encumbrance (collectively, a \"mortgage\" or

currency put warrants or currency call warrants, an owner will receive a cash payment upon exercise only if the currencywarrants have a cash settlement value in excess of zero at that time. the spot exchange rate of the applicable base currency, as compared to the u.s. dollar, will determine whether the currencywarrants have a cash settlement value on any given day prior to their expiration. the currency warrants are expected to be \"out-of-the-money\" (i.e., thecash settlement value will be zero) when initially sold and will be \"in-the-money\" (i.e., their cash settlement value will exceed zero) if, in the caseof currency put warrants, the base currency depreciates against the u.s. dollar to the extent that one u.s. dollar is worth more than the price determined for the base currency in the prospectussupplement or term sheet (the \"strike price\") or, in the case of currency call warrants, the base currency appreciates against the u.s. dollar to the extent one u.s. dollar is worth less than thestrike price. \"cashsettlement value\" on an exercise date (as this term will be defined in the prospectus supplement or term sheet) is an amount that is the greaterof:\\x95 zero, and

warrants in definitive form, in exchange for the global currency warrant. in either instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in the global currency warrant will be entitled tohave a number of currency warrants equivalent to the beneficial interest registered in its name and will be entitled to physical delivery of the currency warrants in definitive form. exercise of currency warrants

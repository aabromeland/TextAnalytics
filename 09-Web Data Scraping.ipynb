Now, the best part is Iowa City blew me away... hip, fun, young and some incredible restaurants.I made my way with the help of my friend to the Pullman. WOW... this is a place to get excited about. First the service is outstanding... we sat at the counter, which I recommend. The food is nothing you would expect.... gourmet versions of some of your favorites.I had the Croque Madame... which you never see in the states. Its a french ham and cheese with béchamel sauce with a egg. It was really heaven... some of the best food I've had. For some reason, their fries were some of the best I've had as well... Pullman what do you do with these fries?The bartender and bar manager were like a well oiled machine... fun, friendly, engaging and efficient.The dessert which was some sort of chocolate mousse was oh so good.I'd say this is the best place to eat in Iowa City, but that wouldn't be fair in this town, but, its one of the top....Seriously, impressed and it takes alot!\",\n",
       " \"We ended up eating here three times in one week!It's that good.Straight forward perfectly made burgers, chicken sandwiches that are plain old delicious.But then there's breakfast.Fresh juices, pancake stacks, and all the fixings.This is the type of place that you can eat at every day and always be satisfied.\",\n",
       " \"I LOVE PULLMAN.I've been here numerous times with family and friends. Great spot for brunch / lunch / dinner. My friends, family, and partner all love this place as well. It's a great local spot in IC. The employees are always kind, service is fast, and the food is fresh.\",\n",
       " \"Happened upon this lovely establishment when in town for a wedding. We had to wait a bit for a table and ended up opting for an outside table because we're Midwesterners and we can handle 40 degrees in a jacket. They have an option to call ahead to get on the waitlist which I would highly recommend!They had a decent draft beer list which my boyfriend enjoyed and I had their award winning Bloody Mary. Very good! Later on I opted for the grapefruit mimosa which was amazing with the fresh squeezed juice. Onto the food, yum! I went for the breakfast bowl and the lemon dill creme fraiche was dynamite!!! I added avocado and bacon and recommend you do too!! It was light yet filling and seriously flavorful. My boyfriend got the crispy chicken sandwich which was also a solid choice. Get the fries on the side with their aioli too! Service was efficient and friendly. We'd for sure be back next time we're in town.\",\n",
       " 'In town for several days, we wanted to check out this restaurant based on its reviews. Unimpressive looking with a small outdoor patio area, the interior is long, narrow and bustling with activity and voices. We lucked out and landed at the diner-bar area where we had front row seats to a very impressive \"ballet\" of 4 to 5 employees preparing all the food. Not much room to move, orders flying in fast, \\xa0it was fascinating to see how well coordinated the staff was at cooking, assembling and getting the orders out. I had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which was wonderful! My companion thoroughly enjoyed the Griddled Turkey Club sandwich and fries he ordered too. Speaking with the staff, which were both hard-working and friendly, we learned they had Pullman swag so we took home several t-shirts to remember this perfect lunch.',\n",

Because we were early we saw and benefited from the delivery of fresh oranges that were squeezed into yummy oj/ mimosas. I enjoyed the fresh grapefruit juice. \\xa0I had the standard breakfast of 2 eggs, bacon, Pullman potatoes and toast WITH butter & jelly. Bacon? Perfect. Eggs over easy? Great. Potatoes. A little bit garlicky for me but like the peppers and onions. Toast? Thick white 2 whole slices! \\xa0D swapped her potatoes for a side of avocado to spread on her toast. \\xa0C had a salmon bacon breakfast sandwich on the best looking brioche bun. And don\\'t forget the homemade hot sauce!Everything was great and again Stephan,(sp) was so gracious and welcoming he definitely made our first visit not our last!',\n",

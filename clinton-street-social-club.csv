"With its jazzy vibes and chill atmosphere, Clinton Street Social Club itself may just be the speakeasy of Iowa City. It's entrance is through a small door next to Shorts burgers and a barber shop. If you don't know what you're looking for, you may never find it. 

In all seriousness they mimic New Orleans culture and have the most delicious food and creative alcoholic beverages. Must try are their beignets, shrimp cocktail, house-batterer curds, sweet corn fritters! 

For alcoholic drinks, I loved their Ramos Gin Fizz the most! I tend to not like anything where I can taste the alcohol and this one has just the right balance. It's has the right amount of fizz with added foam from the egg whites. Very unique compared to the usual bars located downtown. 

I had the opportunity to learn how to tend bar from the all knowing bartender Joy, that girl definitely knows her alcohol. She made us delicious drinks as told us all about its historical discovery.",5
"This was an exceptional surprise in Iowa city! You would find this in someplace like New York or San Francisco or Seattle! The drink menu is amazing, what I can remember of it LOL. The Korean fried chicken and mac & cheese were a delightful pairing together. The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was simply delightful! I would highly recommend this place to any serious Foodie!",5
"There is no other place in town like CSSC. If you are looking for the speakeasy vibe and views of the ped mall this is the place to be. Grab a Silk Road and share the fondue for a perfect date night with ur SO or BFF.

Drinks: Silk Road and Pisco sour if you love egg whites. I love egg white in my cocktails because the foam texture which reminds me of a latte. Annabelle lee is refreshing and they have a selection of whisky / bourbon as well if that's your drink of choice.  Cocktails are $10-$12. Also a handful of beers on tap. 

Food: LOVE the fondue. Melted with apples and caramelizad onions. The poutine is also very popular and I've enjoyed their burger. 

They have a room for darts and pool great for larger groups.",5
"Tucked away through a narrow staircase like a true speak easy should be, you'll find this trifecta perfecta!
Food*Drinks*Atmosphere
Just how lucky ARE you? Or...
Just how lucky are YOU! 
I don't know diggin' there...
Anyway, the CSSC (because I'm lazy):
- is not your average campus pub...
- is not simply a nice place to socialize with great food.
I mean, it IS all that but it's so much effortlessly more.
A lot of work from the menu to the casual layout makes this place Rogers to your Astaire.
In other words... it's a great choice you'll enjoy & will want to visit the next time you're here.",5
"Love. Love. Love. If you're older than the college population, this is your place, my friends. I love the vibe here. It's darkened, has an older population of young adults here. There's candles! There's such good food. And the cocktails? AMAZINGZ. I had the best Tom Collins I've ever had here. Well worth the money and the stop by. 

I highly recommend swinging by for small plates. I had the poutine (fries with gravy and cheeeese) and then also the cheese curds with ranch (deliciously light). 

Go go go! You'll love. 

What to try: Annabel Lee cocktail 

Water rating: 9/10",5
"All I can say is.....WOW!!!  Just go here and get one of their fantastic mixed drinks. I ended up getting the penicillin and it was phenomenal!!! I tried a buddy of mine's Old Fashion and it was awesome as well. I love the space, I loved our bartender, and the drinks were amazing!!  Will definitely be back",5
"This place has the coolest vibe! It has that socialite, speakeasy feel. I made my husband bring me here because I had heard such great things. He also owed me as he was going to be out of town for our 1 year wedding anniversary. Neither of us are big cocktail drinkers so we opted for beer. It was cool to see they had a beer on the menu that is especially made for their establishment from a local brewery in the area. I ordered the BBLT which totally delivered on the promise of bacon by including it in the name twice. My husband got the macaroni and cheese which was amazing! They should have used the word cheese twice because it totally met in the cheese department. We will totally be back although next time we will make a point to get there for happy hour because they have great happy hour food and drink specials.",5
"Fantastic. Feels like you are stepping back in time when you walk into Clinton St SC. It is decorated like a speakeasy back in the 20's and it sure feels like it especially during night time. Also, one of the coolest drink menus if not the coolest drink menus I have ever seen!  The cocktails are amazing my favorite is the Walk The Plank. Their selection of spirits is also by far one of the best anywhere near Iowa City. Besides the drinks the food is great too and for a really awesome price. Especially during happy hour which is 4-6! The vintage burger is a delicious fresh tasting burger and I have tried multiple appetizers that were really good like the the bread with cheese fondue and cornbread rolls! Highly recommend for food or drink! They also have cheese and meat boards which is really cool and unique for downtown Iowa City. P.s home to one of my favorite cocktails in Iowa City the 'Walk the Plank'.",5
"Clinton Street Social Club is a hidden gem up a steep flight of chairs right next to the University of Iowa campus. The speakeasy vibe, views from the windows and the staff make this place so special. Make sure to stop in for the best fine dining in a relaxing atmosphere. Grab a unique cocktail and a great meal while enjoying an intimate conversation with your date or group!",5
"Clinton Street Social Club is a local gem for anyone excited to escape the college crowd and thirsty for some craft cocktails. 

I love the atmosphere. Sit at the bar to watch the bartenders go to work. 
This is secretly one of the best happy hour spots in Iowa City. The social hour runs from 3-6 p.m. and features some excellent apps and incredible drinks. It is a great way to treat yourself without dreading the bill. 

For food, I recommend the House Battered Curds, Brussel Sprout Salad, and the BLBTB. Check out the specials if it is a special occasion. Always delicious.",4
"Nice place in downtown Iowa City that doesn't attract the college students! Yes, you can escape the students here right in the middle of the action.

They have some good offerings here, the cheese curds are one of my favorites. The duck breast if it's on the menu was one of the best I've had, lot of layers of flavor. The steak that I tried needs more flavor, for $30 it should be way better. Other than that everything else is pretty good. I really like their lavender craft soda, usually down a few of those with my meal.

A place worth trying when in the area, they do a good job of offering some fine dining in a relaxing atmosphere.",4
"Great drinks and awesome happy hour. I got the devils apple cocktail which had a nice punch with a dash of cayenne. It was perfect for sipping during the movie night where you also get free popcorn. Apparently the flavor changes all the time so its a gamble, but I heard they're all good.",5
"Perfect spot for a cocktail and snack after our conference. Social hour is Mon-Fri from 4-6pm and a great deal.
Awesome jazz and strong drinks.

The cheese curds were phenomenal and I will probably dream about them. I'm not an olive fan, but the table loved them and we all enjoyed the sweet corn fritters. The honey and goat cheese made the fritters delightful.

Perfect hidden gem.",5
"Two stars. Go for the cocktails. The cheese curds are a menu highlight - food otherwise is OK. For a place where the bill is never less than $100 the service is equivalent to a college town burger joint. Recently had a diners meal not severed because the waiter didn't put it on the ticket, appetizers and main courses served at the same time, waiter argued with us when we pointed out the apps would have been preferred before the main dishes. Very amateur service.",2
"Hey, Clinton Street Social Club, I'm on to you. 

Killer happy hours tend to have uninspired food and ordinary drinks in university towns, but you decided to break the mold.  You're a hidden treasure in a sea of college bars.

You don't deliver a product, but an unforgettable experience at an affordable price and I dig that.

The space you live in used to be a smelly, boozy college hangout.  Back in the day, I would never choose to go there.  I'd be dragged along by friends and 'rewarded' with twenty odd dirt cheap pitchers.  The next morning I'd lay in bed remembering (or rather feeling) if I had conquered the dreaded stairs or if they had won our latest encounter.

Now, in my adult life, you've become one of my go-tos.  I feel sophisticated hanging my coat and putting my umbrella in your stand as I saunter to the bar.  Sitting on a stool, ordering an old fashioned or a craft beer makes me feel as though all is right in the world.  Truly.  I'm smiling at my screen like an idiot writing this because you're the bee's knees.

You literally didn't have a TV on during March Madness and I was ok with that. That's so weird... but so Clinton Street Social Club.

Ok, so there is ONE thing I'd change about you.  It would be so sexy if your entrance was a red phone booth.  I'd enter and pick up the phone, needing to call with a password to get in.  Because A) THATS AWESOME and B) it'd be the exclamation point to your whole vibe.

Potential CSSC regular, you won't regret coming here for a happy hour.  It's Monday thru Friday from 4-6pm.  Enjoy half off their stellar draught beer selection and discounted food.  I've never left upset but-- I suppose I've also known about the stairs and lack of televisions as well.  So consider yourself warned.",5
"The coolest place in Iowa city! You have to know where your going because it's just a door front on the street. 
You open the door & walk up this narrow dark stairway to the second floor & literally you feel like you walked into a speak easy. 

But the cool atmosphere is only part of the story. If you're a restaurant you better have good food and they do. We started with green eggs & ham, love Dr Seuss & this app. We also had corn fritters, when in Iowa you have to eat something with corn it! They were pretty good too. My coworker had salmon which he said was awesome, I had the scallops which were delicious as well. 

They have a great draft beer list & all kinds of cool cocktails. Bartender was great guy! 


To top it all off they have this cool room off to the side of the bar where u can throw darts or play pool for free. 

You have to check this place out.",5
"Clinton Street is a nice change of pace downtown, particularly if you are not a student and looking for somewhere a bit more adult to hang out. 

My favorite thing about this restaurant is their cocktails. Iowa City has been slow to develop a good craft cocktail scene like bigger cities and so Clinton Street really stands out. They have a good mix of classics (love the French 75) and seasonal cocktails. Their list is much more on par with what you might find at good cocktail bars in other parts of the country (Chicago, Detroit, New York, LA, etc.). They are definitely the best in Iowa City.

While I go to Clinton Street primarily for cocktails, they also have great food. I have tried a number of things on the menu including mussels, mac and cheese and the burger. Everything is always great, I haven't tried anything I did not like. 

This is also a good place for small groups--when possible I recommend getting a table on the second floor, such a nice atmosphere!",5
"Yum! More drink oriented than food, but the food was great. Drinks were wonderful! Not the cheapest place downtown, but worth it. Wonderful atmosphere. Our waitress was heckin' awesome - super knowledgeable about the drinks and spent time talking with us, I didn't feel rushed and pressured like I often do. They take reservations. A bit of a jazzy, speakeasy vibe. Dark lighting. Would be a great date spot. 5/5 would recommend! You take the stairs to get there, not sure if handicap accessible.",5
"If you've been to new Orleans and had a visit to the Roosevelt hotel for a world famous Sazerac, then you need to come here. Marcus in the bar just put the Sazerac on a new level. New Orleans, watch out for this guy. He does it better. Food here is awesome. Atmosphere is perfect with great music and conversation. This place is a must!",5
"The entrance is nestled between two larger first floor buildings so keep your eyes peeled! You take stairs up to the second level which houses their main dining room and bar. You can order food at the bar as well if there's a wait for the dining area. I really love the third floor for a late night chat and cocktail - can't seem to figure out when it's open and when it's not though....

My favorite place to get cocktails in Iowa City! 

My go to drink is the Silk Road. Love the egg white and Earl Grey tea floating on top - give such an amazing aroma when sipping the drink. 

The fact that they have a late night menu is also a super plus. I've been here for dinner as well as a post dinner chill session with later snacking of olives and oysters (odd combo!? but delicious). 

For dinner you can't go wrong with their clinton street fries or mushroom ragout. The oyster mushrooms and grilled endive are divine and go well with the sweet corn porridge. The cheese curds and corn fritters are great starters. 

Still need to go back and try the charcuterie sometime!

It's also pretty easy to host an event here if you need to. We've rented out the third floor for a pretty reasonable price for an evening including food and drink. Had a great time and everyone enjoyed the cocktail menu.",5
"I don't know what impressed me most: the food, the ambience, or the delicious beverages. We hosted an event in their upstairs space last night, and in the span of an hour, they made me a total convert. The space is wonderful, if limited for those unable to maneuver a large staircase right off the bat. If you are able to make it upstairs, you'll find a wonderful bar and seating area, with additional space on the third floor when it's not rented out for events. The Silk Road drink is amazing. Words can't do it justice. As for food, do NOT miss the cheese curds. Even my Wisconsin friends said these were the real deal. Equally impressive were the deviled eggs, sweet corn fritters, and charcuterie boards. As long as you can stand fried foods, you'll be getting the best of the best. It's definitely a little on the higher end price-wise, but for a special occasion, it's a must-visit. If you're on a tight budget like I am, apparently their happy hour deals allow you to enjoy the cheese curds (and other things of course but we know the priority here) for half price!",5
"I dug this bar.  It's a little on the pretentious side, but the happy hour specials are on point.  Cheese curds were good, and the drink specials were a nice touch.  I scoped out the upper floor, and that seems like a cool spot.  It was crowded, and the service was very slow.  But it's a fun place for happy hour!",4
"Definitely my top choice for a relaxed date night. It can be tough to find, on account of it being hidden and all, but once you get there, good news - you have about 9,000 steep stairs to climb!

The food is great. We had poutine, some delicious pasta dishes, and a dessert special that was exceptional. Unlike some spots in Iowa City that want to turn over tables as quickly as possible, they were happy to let us relax with our after-dinner coffees. Highly recommend. Just be sure to bring your hiking boots.",4
Love this place!   Great burger and hush puppies.  The mix drinks are delicious and a great selection of red wines.  Wish they would change the menu options more often.  This place should be doing more big city menu items.  Not higher price but maybe look at other restaurants and see what they are doing.,5
"A bunch of my girl friends and I decided to go in during their happy hours and try their oysters. THEIR RAW OYSTERS ARE SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD. Seriously, it's very comparable to the ones that I got in San Francisco. Very fresh and Big oysters, with very reasonable pricing if you go during happy hours (6 for $10). Five of us we ordered a total of four dozens of oysters. I didn't try it with the tobasco sauce, since I feel like the original taste of it so i only squeezed some lemon on top. I'll definitely go back for those oysters. 

The fondue we ordered to share was good. We all wished that the bread was cut in smaller pieces tho. 

This place is a good place to hangout. They also have pool table too. Will make more trips to this place in the future!",4
"My favorite bar to go grab a cocktail in a very neat environment. Cheese curds are the best in town, love the brick wall that's exposed and dim lighting. The event space upstairs is nice too!",5
"Hands down, one of my favorite places to eat in Iowa City. 

The atmosphere is hip, trendy, yet familiar and inviting at the same time. If you are fortunate enough to visit on a night with live music, you're in for a treat. 

The service has always been spectacular. Whether we were the only ones in there for a late lunch, or it was a full house on a Friday night, the service has always been consistent.

One thing I always appreciate is their seasonal menu. 
While this may drive some people crazy, I like knowing they use fresh ingredients in their food. 

My favorites:
Milton Cheddar Mac - Cheesy, gooey, great crust on top. yum yum.
Old Capitol Steak Sandwich - Meat cooked perfectly. Great choice of bread. (Not sure if it is on the menu at time of post.)
Hush Puppies - Great outer crust and fluffy on the inside. The creole aioli goes well w these. Oh, and the fries!

 At one point they had beignets with a berry compote, those were AMAZING. 

Their beer and cocktail selection is great too. The Annabel Lee is made with house-made lemon-lavender cordial I believe. 

If you haven't been here, why haven't you? 

*Random side note* I really like their hardwood floors and light fixtures.",5
Went here tonight my birthday with friends. We were seated on the third floor and had an awesome view of the Pentacrest. The service was good. The food was good. The ambiance of the restaurant was really awesome. Got a little loud but I think that's to be expected. Had a Havana Slinger and will be getting it again. The hanger steak was good and cooked a perfect medium. The creme brulee was pretty great. Thanks for a good start to year 30!,5
"My husband and I used to live in Iowa City but moved two years ago . We had a one night getaway mapped out and were SO excited - Clinton St was our #1 spot , so we couldn't wait for dinner and drinks . I don't know if it's under new ownership, but our experience was atrocious in regards to service . We sat at the bar , and had our first cocktail and ordered olives . We had finished the olives , had our dinner order ready , but were entirely ignored for well over an hour . We were given water refills , but the bartenders never once stuck around long enough for us to follow up on dinner or more drinks . My husband tried waving staff down but to no avail . The restaurant and bar were DEAD (college break) , and the wait staff and bartenders were frequently huddled chatting . We eventually decided to just close out and go to Pullman , where the service and food were 10/10 . I'm sad to say this place seems to have taken a turn for the worst - we won't be back .",1
"I have a new favorite in Iowa City. This place is awesome.  We had the fondue, salmon, fish and chips, and tenderloin, everything was great.  We will be back.",5
"Best cocktails in town. Things I love include: poutine, oysters, bucket of bacon, BBLT Sammy, pork belly and anything they happen to have on special. I always order the Annabel Lee but they also have great wine deals on Thursdays.",5
"Cool place with the nest cocktails in the city. Many drinks ive never heard of, but all very well made. Havent done food, will try that soon. A bit ""spendy"" but a reasonable price for a gentle buzz.",4
"Such a fun semi-swanky bar! It's speakeasy style and pulls it off pretty well. They have a great drink selection with lots of whiskies and special craft cocktails, and specials a lot of the time. Whisky was 30% off on the Wednesday we went, and I think every Wednesday. 

My wife and I got two drinks that couldn't have been more different. I got the gentleman's bet, which is creamy with rum, Bailey's, bourbon and egg white. I felt it was a little overpriced at $11 for the small amount I got in an up glass. It was also not super cold but it was still pretty tasty and unique. 

My wife got the Devil's Apple, with Bourbon, Cider, lemon, maple and ... CAYENNE PEPPER! (Served in the rocks). The server said we could request less or more cayenne but after requesting less, it still had a lot of kick! Actually it worked out nicely because I got to enjoy it when her throat started burning! If you got some cajones, go for it! It's delicious and it's really not too too spicy if you ask for less cayenne. 

Finally we got a peach cobbler with oats, berries and mascarpone cheese (please don't pronounce it MARscapone because the French, and spelling bee officials will hate you). We LOVED this dessert. The Gentleman's Bet paired well with it. Fresh peaches and berries, sweet oats, and creamy mascarpone... Hit the spot. 

The service was a bit slow but very friendly, patient and helpful. I think the bottleneck was someone training at the bar, so not docking points for that. Overall the vibe was great, drinks pretty good, dessert awesome and next time we'll have to use the pool table!",5
Great selection of drinks and cheese curds are a must! The third floor is great for private events!,5
"A solid 4 stars for the drinks and atmosphere. Used to be 5 but the food is somewhat inconsistent. The mushroom ragout was my favorite dish but the last few times I've ordered it, the taste has gone downhill. Overall still my go-to for a good drink or two!",4
"Atmosphere is nice, although they may be trying a little too hard to be ""cool.""  Food is lacking in variety and honestly not great bit don't let that deter you.  They have free pool and darts and the atmosphere is great for a date.  Specialty drinks are a bit pretentious and simply not that great but they have a full bar and make a mean martini.  Worth a shot.",3
"Very impressed. Our first visit and very happy to say the drink and menu offerings were nicely varied and very good. Shared the deviled eggs, potted crab and fondue as appetizers. All were quite tasty though the fondue was terribly thin. Our server suggested it was because it was hot and it would thicken as it cooled. It never did but as I said, it was very tasty so it's being too thin didn't stop us from enjoying it. Service was great and the place has a really pleasant vibe/atmosphere. Would love to go back for its live jazz night. Give this place a try!",4
"Love this place, but don't love all their menu items. I've only ever been here for parties, so we always have the top floor rented out. It's a really cool spot, love the light fixtures and exposed brick walls! Absolutely perfect for parties. Lotsf of tables and also comfy chairs and a bar. I like this place bc although it is in the heart of downtown, it doesn't seem to be overrun with students not wearing pants. 

Now the food...I've mostly had ""heavy"" hors d'oeuvres that were ordered for the party. Not really enough food for dinner, though. The only thing I've ordered myself was the poutine, which was very good. Everything else was really not too good. Charcuterie platters were just fine, but nothing terribly interesting, all your usual meats and cheeses. Lots of items with bacon infused in them like dates and crab cakes, sorry I don't really like bacon (I know, I'm insane) . The grilled polenta with tapenade is literally inedible. Absolutely gross, just say no. The few items that were very good were toasted french bread with creme fresh and tomatoes. I ate like 22 of them. And the chocolate truffles are fantastically simple and perfect, rich but not too sweet. The wine selection is small, but I liked everything I had so I was happy with it. The cocktail menu has a lot of liqueurs I've never heard of so I just got overwhelmed and ordered wine. Next time I will just ask for a recommendation.",5
"Finally got around to having dinner here and I'm now mad we didn't come in sooner. Located on the 2nd and 3rd floors off Clinton street, the dark staircase leads you up to where the magic is happening! We've been here 5 times now and it's become our go to for a solid night out.

As an aside, it's beyond me where the folks giving Clinton Street poor ratings are going for their meals. More details below obviously, but for us it's been one of the better finds in a long time. Perhaps sticking to the 2 for 20 menu will offer the haters better selections and we'll just keep slumming here - but I digress.

To begin, the beer, wine and drink menu is excellent. A great many options including a number you don't see often. It's comparable or better than most places in the area, but what sets it apart are the beer and wine cocktails. The Stout Diplomat (Stout beer w/ a shot of dark rum) is blissful and will let you know that you've enjoyed a stiff drink this evening. The rum takes the bitter away from the stout and the stout takes the sting away from the rum. I imagine the inventor of said drink had a similar experience to when peanut butter and chocolate got together for the first time - great apart...inseparable together. My better half had the champaign cocktail and it too was quite tasty. Great blend of flavors from a beverage I'm normally super excited about.

The options for cuisine here are grouped into small, medium and large plates. We've always found the most interesting things in the small and medium range so we tend to order a number and split with the group. The pub Fondue here is unreal! Onions and apples swim within a molten lake of awesome and are graced by a baguette that is simply begging to be dipped in said lake of awesomeness. The bucket of bacon is sheer genius and worth trying once with a group. Next, a fun item we've found a number of times are the deviled eggs of the day. A set of 4 halves, filled with the dreams of unicorns and kisses of angels - most recently this included BBQ as well. We've sampled the ""green eggs and ham"" and the ""BBQ beef"" deviled eggs and both were fantastic. The cheese curds and poutine are quite good as well.

In the past, we've had the medium plate special and one stood out among others. We had a tomato plate that included tomatoes from the owners garden, some chevre drizzled with basil oil, grilled peaches and crustini. I was skeptical at first, but all doubts about anything here melted away with the first bite. Straight up one of the most memorable food bites I've had. The slight sour and salt of the chevre, with the acidity of the tomato and the sweetness of the warm peach, all cradled by crusty bread. This dish may have been what Vikings were searching for back in the day and is a big reason we're always looking on the specials menu when we come back. 

Finally, the desserts are generally excellent here was well. Most recently we had a deconstructed creme brulee. Great flavor and great presentation. 

In the end, Clinton Street Social Club has become our go to spot. The combination of an excellent beer selection, beer/wine cocktails, great menu staples and even better specials makes this one place that is not to be missed. The atmosphere of a speakeasy with decor to match and live music on weekends, make CSSC unique in the area and in the region. For any food lover in search of something a little different that will leave you wanting to come back, this spot is a must.",5
"Best cocktails in town, hands down. Great shareable plates. Get cozy with your date or enjoy a night with friends, or even a big party upstairs. A must try for everyone.",5
"Wow wow wow, this place! I walked in a while back but the wait was longer than what I had time for so last night I finally made it back and pulled up a seat at the bar. What a great experience! 

From the picturesque view of the Old Capitol (being on the second story, you get a lush, tree-level view), to the overall dark yet classy, big-city vibe, I'm already planning my next trip back and I know this will be a new go-to stop when showing out of town guests around! 

Several Yelpers have mentioned that their cocktails are not to be beaten, so I ordered the Havana Slinger and was sure not disappointed! I was a little worried it would be childishly sweet but dang, what wonderful balance between rum, ginger ale, and citrus! I also ordered the hush puppies and when they were first delivered, they were very dark and a little smokey smelling (read: I thought they were burnt). But upon taking my first bite with a touch of creole aioli on the side, mmmhmm they were spot on! A soft and slightly crispy outside and pleasantly sweet inside made these puppies the perfect partner to my havana slinger cocktail. 

The staff were all very down to earth and patient with my slow ordering habits (this menu is incredible, I had to read it over several times) and I can hardly wait to return for the dinner side of the menu!",5
"I love grown-up bars and I love old fashioneds. Finding both will have won me for life.

Going to college in a college town, I often found myself trying to find bars which were out of the way from the masses of loud, obnoxious students despite my youth (perhaps I'm an old soul). I like to go out somewhere I have space to sit down and order something that is not a Bud Light. This is exactly the place I would I have frequented had I gone to college here, and even a more mature me appreciates this type of establishment.

For whiskey drinkers, this place has very large selection of whiskey from which to choose from. I opted for a simple old fashioned with Templeton. What I received was a small but well-made cocktail, with lemon and a REAL maraschino cherry. I say real because the cherry was actually the color of a fresh cherry and not some bright red confection.

The bartenders here were attentive, and I was not made to feel like a student which for a college town bar is always a plus. I would not hesitate to return here when my travels bring me to Iowa City again.",5
"This is by far my favorite place to grab a drink in Iowa City. When you're looking to get away from the college bar scene and feel like a real grownup, this is the place to go. I've heard people complain about the price before, but honestly I think you pay for what you get. And if you're looking for nice liquor and nice cocktails that aren't meant to be pounded back 5 in a row, this is the place you should go. Great selection including local beers. Every cocktail I've tried here has truly been amazing and the bartenders and waitstaff are all very helpful with liquor suggestions.

The food that I've had here has also always been good for the most part. I've never ordered a  meal here, my friends and I will usually just order several small plates or a meat and cheese board (which is what you should get in my opinion) and share. 

Great drinks, great service, great atmosphere (live music!), everything about Clinton Street Social Club is pretty great. Definitely give it a shot if you're looking for a classier night out in downtown Iowa City",5
"Great happy hour, knowledgeable bartender and versatile menu. Terrific location in the heart of Iowa City.",5
"An awesome place with great atmosphere! The happy hour special is necessary; otherwise it will definitely feel overpriced, especially for the Midwest. But my service was awesome, and the food and drinks very decent. Listening to jazz at a reasonable volume while enjoying the place created the perfect atmosphere.",5
"One of the only places in Iowa City with MOJO!!!

I went to college in Minneapolis and there were so many great and classy restaurants with their own unique vibe near campus (Kitty Kat Club, Loring Pasta, Annie's, etc.).  I've been disappointed at how few of these locations Iowa City has.  Clinton Street tops my list for atmosphere in Iowa City.

The Vibe:  Hipster-Speak Easy.  Get ready to be served a 9 dollar cocktail by a 27 year old-grad student sporting a waxed mustache and suspenders.  Normally this would piss me off but in this case it just works. 

My favorites:
- Drinks:  Gin Fizz
- Meal:  Vintage Cheddar Burger
- App:  You can't go wrong with their fries.  Its always worth asking if they happen to be serving their popcorn cooked in bacon grease.

Avoid:
- Deviled Eggs:  We got Caesar Salad Deviled Eggs, they were gross.

Word of Warning:
- They do prix fixed menus for holidays.  The food is still wonderful, but it will run about $60 per plate and you won't have many options.",5
"The address seemed odd for a restaurant, implying a small space, but when we arrived it was immediately apparent that the restaurant is on the second floor. And then the hostess led us to the 3rd floor! 

In our typical manner, we shared several things, which were good, but the charcuterie board deserves special mention. I am writing this review retrospectively, after a nine day roadtrip that involved dining at 8 different restaurants in Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota and Minnesota. We ordered a charcuterie board numerous times, but the one at Clinton Street Social Club was the best; hands down; by far. Memorable. 

They offer live jazz, but only two nights of the week. Nevertheless the jazz playing in the background was nice, as was the ambiance of this old building. Our server was attentive, polite, and friendly. 

Food: 4 stars (5 stars for the charcuterie board)
Ambiance: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars",4
"This is a classy establishment. The food is delicate, graceful, and indulgent. The feel of the place is a blend of modern upscale and prohibition era. The staff is well dressed and well mannered. The bar serves up gourmet cocktails that are truly thought provoking. I suggest getting something off their cocktail menu. They know what they are doing. The last time I was in I had the brussel sprout salad and a glass of Lambrusco. It left me feeling replenished. 

Enjoy!",5
"This is definitely one of my favorite bars in Iowa City. You can leave the craziness of the undergrads behind, and find solace here! The drinks are amazing, and they have a great bourbon collection. Yesterday was the first time I've eaten there. Food was great! I ordered the Milton Mac and Cheese which had bacon and spinach in it. YUM! I also had beignets for dessert which was really great too. Definitely coming back here for dinner. The service was great and they sat our table of 12 right away. You can call ahead for reservations as well",5
We went for a weeknight dinner while visiting my daughter at school.  We had a cocktail while waiting for the table and they were very good.  Great selection of specialty cocktails that were prepared well.    The ambience was great and would like to come back for drinks.  The meal was not on the same level as the drinks.   I had the fish and chips and my wife had the hanger steak.  Both were cooked very well but lacked seasoning.  Wanted to like it more and will have to give it another try.    We both were a bit disappointed,4
"One of my favorite places to eat and drink (if you're in a swankier kind of mood) in Iowa City! The menu is quite unique and changes all of the time, depending on the season and the local availability of ingredients. Have never been disappointed with my meal here. They also have a great drink menu, thought probably a little over priced. The ambiance is lovely, very cute and old fashioned. My friend had a 1920s themed birthday party and we came here for drinks; the vibe was perfect. Definitely give this place a try!",5
"My favorite bar in Iowa City, and one of the best places to get specialty cocktails. A speak easy style bar that has an awesome ambience and good menu. The Social Club is highly recommended.",5
I didn't have high expectations of the food in Iowa City and was happily surprised at Clinton Street Social Club. Food here is good- fresh and well seasoned. And the atmosphere of the restaurant is a big plus too.,4
"What can I say that hasn't been yelped before...  This joint has great speak easy abeyance.  It is a favorite of my wife and me.  You can dress to the nines, have quality whiskey(and there are many), and slurp heavenly oysters. 
   Just be sure to carry enough funds to do it right. If you spend less than $80 your probably cheating yourself. I also love that it keeps the bums, and downtrodden hipsters away.",5
"Great drinks and appetizers. With my go to being the hush puppies that comes with excellent dipping sauce. If you're looking for a great drink go with the Grandpa's Coffin-delicious and also entertaining to watch while it's being made. The bartenders a very knowledgeable and do a good job explaining the complexities of each drink. Sit at the bar, grab a drink and an app, and watch them work.",5
"I've been here a number of times and tried a bunch of different items on their menu, from staples like the mac & cheese to small plates (poutine, salads, etc.) and items on their rotating menu, and have never been disappointed! The food is definitely pretty heavy but it's all really well-made and delicious. Drinks are absolutely to die for - they have some really interesting combinations and probably the most comprehensive liquor list in the area. Highly recommend!",5
"Pros:
1. Excellent atmosphere that is unlike any in Iowa City. Has a prohibition vibe going to it. Also nice to overlook the University of Iowa old capitol lawn. 
2. Excellent drink menu. Many many liquors to choose from and usually has quite a few local beer options. 
3. The appetizers are great for stopping in for happy hour. I particularly enjoyed the cheese curds. 

Cons:
1. I was not impressed with the dinner menu, both for selection and performance. I had the fish and chips, great fish inside, but the breading was way too salty. Secondly, the ""chips"" were potato wedges that were severely undercooked. Some were still crunchy even. Perhaps their small plates are better. 

Bottom line, I'd go back for drinks and an appetizer, but unsure if I'll stay for a full meal again.",3
"The beer selection (at least in bottles) here is pretty great. Too bad they didn't have more on tap, but that can be overlooked.

Their whiskey selection was quality.

The oysters were very tasty (which for me, says a lot, as I'm not a huge oyster fan). These oysters were great! (If a bit spendy).

The mixed drinks were also good, though had some room for improvement.

The atmosphere here is really solid as well, and then help is very friendly.

It was booked pretty solid on a Friday night. We, as walk ins, did need to eat at the bar. This was fine, but some people wouldn't like it.

Definitely will be coming here more regularly, when I'm in the mood.",4
"One of the best whiskey libraries in the state of Iowa, and they give a generous pour. Great atmosphere. I've never had a bad time, or even mediocre time, here. Highly recommended!",4
"It's the fourth time we come here. Usually they have ok food but this time I ordered ancho shrimp salad, which is very disappointing. The shrimps are cold and salty. Tomatoes aren't roasted as described in the menu and they pit cold fried onion in it. I told the sever that but they just microwave my shrimps. My bf ordered a burger, which is ok but fries are undercook, oily and salty. Some of cocktails are good but most of them are too sour-bitter. Give 2 stars for atmosphere.",2
"Amazing craft cocktails.
Excellent/creative atmosphere.
Cheese curds, cheese curds, cheese curds!!!",5
"This is my favorite place in town to get food or drinks. The ambiance transports you to a different time, and it's nicer than many other options in town without feeling ""highfalutin."" I have loved everything I have ordered here.",5
This is a wonderful place.  The atmosphere is amazing as it has a warm and comfortable feel.  We had amazing drinks at the bar and then enjoyed the cheese fondue and oysters.  The food was excellent.  I would highly recommend this restaurant!!,5
"Clinton Street Social Club is what Iowa City needs more of.  Moving here from a city of around a million or so people, you can find places with well executed drinks and food fairly often.  In a college town of under 90k, this doesn't seem to happen as often.  I have had a variety of food items here and have never left unhappy.  The place has a nice vintage-charm to it, that much of the rest of Iowa City bars lack.

I know most places have their own version of ""mac and cheese"" and everyone hypes it up.  In this case, Clinton Street Social Club's mac and cheese is the envy of the rest of the city.  It pairs nicely with the shrimp roll. 

The drink menu is as extensive as it is potent.  I would suggest anything on the list.  They have several taps and seem to try to go with an English Ale vibe on what they bring in for the taps.",5
"Love!!! So I enter and immediately see far too many people I work with, but that's a good sign, it's apparently the place to be!  Another good sign: they serve Hendricks gin (my favorite).  So of course on a Friday night we had a little wait, but it was well worth it, especially just grabbing a drink at the bar while we waited.  I love the speak easy feel!! Now to the important part: food! So I don't know what came over me to order deviled eggs.  I haven't had deviled eggs since some girl in elementary school convinced me the ones she made were great... Considering I'm 27 now you know how awesome those eggs must have been!  Anyways, back to the review, spinach deviled eggs: I now like deviled eggs!!! Seriously good.  We also had the fondue... Wow yummmmm! The last time I had fondue it was at a popular cheese restaurant in NYC, and seriously it was THAT good.  Then I ordered the vintage cheddar burger.  Again not a big burger person but I have come to figure out if a places burger is good, then they are all around good because they know the basics, and this burger was great!   I really have no negatives about this place besides the wait, but having a wait means it's good.  So would you rather have a wait for awesome food or no wait for sub par food?  

Bonus: not a big college scene",5
"Lovely spot to have good food, good drink & good company. Unique & strong cocktails, innovative but classic food.  We were really surprised by the freshness & flavor of the raw oysters there recently, I hate Brussels sprouts but enjoyed their salad. Prices not insane but high enough to keep out the kids. A dark respite from the heat. Wish the upper floor was open during the week...",5
"Unique menu items and a classy ambience. I will definitely be back! 

Pork belly:
--- Taste
I thought this dish would be savory and rich, and it definitely was. The pork was tender, juicy, and quite fatty as it is the belly meat. There is a bit of orange-fennel slaw and a chili glaze on this. The little peeled orange pieces added a sweet, tart/tangy touch as a complement to the rich pork. The fennel also added a nice crunch. I didn't really notice the chili glaze, but upon recollection I guess it was a sweet glaze that blended in with the orange. 
--- Portion size:
Too big. This is under the medium sized plates on the menu. As you can see above, I don't really have an issue with the taste of this, I just think the portion is too big. I would not order this nor recommend it as an entree for one person to consume by himself or herself. There were three approximately palm-sized pieces of pork on the plate. After about the first or second piece, I started to feel a bit queasy. The dish is just so rich and fatty that I started to feel kind of nauseated. I continued to feel that way until I had some coffee afterwards. So while this tastes good, I wouldn't recommend someone to eat this alone unless you have a high tolerance for fatty food. I would recommend sharing this. However, I feel like this would be best as an appetizer instead of an entree. A few bites of this would be more reasonable in my opinion. 

Service:
Surprising slower than what I was expecting. It took about 35 minutes for my group of 9 (including me) to receive our food, which I understand because it is a fairly large group. However, it took us a while to get our checks for some reason. Overall we spent about 2 hours there for dinner. So I would probably not come here if I had to get a quick meal. However, our waitress was nice and patient with us, and even helped take a photo of us for my friend's birthday.",3
"This is a classy bar with delicious food and a good drink menu. The décor has exposed brick juxtaposed clean lines. There's a pool table, which is usually in use. I highly recommend stopping by for drinks and apps.",5
"Decent place, they have a great view of the capital and a unique atmosphere. Food is overpriced and drinks aren't great unless you like scotch and whisky.",3
"If you're looking for places that aren't riddled with college students, this is a great start. Clinton Street Social Club is a pleasant blast from the past with bartenders dressed in hipster/20's attire and classic cocktails being served in high fashion. I have yet to eat there, but the cocktails and young professional infused environment keeps me coming back. Bring your credit card, as these classy concoctions come with a premium price...but you pay for why you get with top shelf ingredients and service to match.",4
"I haven't eat there yet, but always have a drink or more there. 
5 stars because they have a lot of different beers that we usually can't drink, draft or bottles. They also have a lot of different liquors, whiskey, scotch, vodka, etc... The owner even bought some french liquors after being advised by a friend.
The prices are not very expensive, people are very nice and you can even play pool for free. 
One thing: I love the ambiance there! The music is not too strong and very relaxing.",5
"This turned out to be a cool place to kill some time, while I was in Iowa City. It has a laid-back, speakeasy vibe. I was actually pretty impressed with both the quality of the wines, and the staff's ability to make recommendations.

The menu was small, but well thought out, and interesting. I had the cheese curds, which are apparently a specialty of the house. They had a good flavor, and I liked that they weren't to heavily battered.

All in all, I thought that this place was a nice surprise, and a refreshing change from the typical college town scene.",5
"I have not eaten here yet, but have been here twice for drinks. The atmosphere and servers alone make the place spectacular.  The drinks were tasty and artfully crafted. Hope to have a meal here in the near future.",5
"This place is so good that I can't imagine that anyone wouldn't enjoy it.  If you don't like what Clinton Street is offering, we have nothing in common.  Not only do they have the best whiskey list that I've seen in Iowa outside of the Royal Mile in Des Moines, they have oysters and pork belly.  I have been looking for oysters and pork belly and that sort of thing since moving to Iowa City, and damn.  It's about time.

The ambience is great, the food rocks, and yea, it's gonna take a while to get a mixed drink, but the bartenders are doing a hell of a lot more than throwing well liquor and a soda mixer into a tumbler.  It's worth the wait.  There aren't a whole lot of places that I've found around here where you can go out to dinner and feel like an adult, but Clinton Street is one of the best.  

One last thing. Again, I don't understand people saying that this place is a little pricey.  Pretty much every place that I've like on this Yelp thing in Iowa City has a few comments about being a little spendy.  Hell, I think that there might have been one or two of those about Oasis Falafel.  Give me a break.  Good food costs a bit.  If you're not into that, then just don't do it.  A buddy of mine has a sign up in his tattoo shop that reads ""Good Tattoos Aint Cheep and Cheep Tattoos Aint Good.""  I think that could apply here too.  If you want to feel like your at a big city bar with good food and have a classy night, this is one of your best options.",5
"Been here many many times. Service has shaped up immensely since their opening year. Most extensive cocktail game in town hands down. Worth the wait for drinks, if there is one, because it's busy and like food, good drinks take time. Food isn't anything to write home about but it is definitely not anything to complain about either. Come for drinks. Order food if you get drunk. Thanks social club.",5
"our newest favorite place to eat. We showed up early but on a Saturday night and while it was understandable that we had to wait for a bit, it gave us chance to soak up the energy of the restaurant - great vibe. Busy but not packed bar area. Servers were busy but all were smiling and happy to ask if you needed anything while waiting. Getting seated, the experience continued to bring smiles to all at the table. 
Drinks came fairly quickly. Server was VERY solicitous of our wanting to explore the menu for a few more minutes than would probably be ""normal"", and repeatedly told us to take our time. 
Had a few different dishes and everyone was extremely happy with what they ordered. Some of the best food we've had in IC!! 
We even had a fun chat with one of the servers who was an Aussie, and we laughed about some of the different sayings here vs. there. But once we were done, he was off to some other task, having never given us anything but total attention while speaking with us. We will definitely be back. Jazz Thursdays!",4
"i could not help but think through our entire meal that i was eating on the ""old"" one-eyed jakes dance floor! ha!
food was great!  i had fish n chips.  our table had curds, aspar, poutine and deviled eggs.
delish!",5
"This is where grown ups come to drink.

Tucked away above Short's, Clinton St. is a wonderful find here in Iowa City. The ambiance is great, with a retro warehouse feel and beautiful views out onto the Pentacrest. Their real attraction is the drinks list: many interesting cocktails, my personal favorite being the Grandpa's Coffin (bourbon, scotch, locally made apple brandy, and bitters). They also have a ""Murderer's Row"" of high-end whiskey should that strike your fancy. I'd say this place competes with Devotay for best cocktails in Iowa City. They also have a well-chosen, if small, beer list, and I have had good times with their wines.

The food has been very good. Last night, I had their smoked salmon nicoise salad, which had excellent flavor, and my wife had a tasty vegetarian quiche. They used to carry a really flavorful veggie burger, but appear to have dropped that from the menu within the past couple of months. On another visit, the salmon entrée was also good, though less memorable than the nicoise salad.

What's neat about this place is that it's consciously striving to be a new cultural hub downtown. During a visit for Mission Creek I saw that they hosted jazz and poetry readings. They also have darts and pool tables off in side rooms, in a perfect environment for that kind of thing. I see lots of young professionals and UI faculty here, to give an indication of clientele. I will be returning, frequently.",5
"I could not say more positive things about this establishment. I recently moved out of town but I try and make it back here every time I come back into town. 

I love the look and feel of this restaurant above all else. There is no where else in town like it. All of the bar and wait staff are very knowledgable and friendly to the customers. The menu has many unique options that cannot be found anywhere else in town.

You can always find yourself a good time here with plenty of seating for dining in, getting drinks at the down or upstairs bar, and free pool and darts any night of the week. They often have live music on most weekends. This place is a real bar with actual fun things to do in a city full of poorly operated and managed bars. Five stars.",5
"Clinton Street Social Club is billed as a cocktail bar with a real menu and while that's true, the result is that they don't do either exceptionally. 

It's greatest benefit is in being a place that will hopefully scare away the throngs of college kids. The fries were great - my portabella sandwich was good and my drink was good enough to finish but not great enough to have another.  

It's a great place to grab a quick drink and maybe a bite, great to hang out for a bit - probably not The Place to go though.",3
"Always great tunes playing here - Horace Silver or Miles Davis or other jazz. Live music some nights (not while I've been there thought).  Great bar (nice craft beer and craft cocktails). Menu is 3-4 pages of drinks and 1 page of food.  The food is very fun - deviled eggs, and brussel sprout salad are favorites.  Tonight I had the bacon lettuce bacon tomato bacon sandwhich - tasty.  We also shared the hush puppies, which were great.  More to explore. Small plates to large.

Come for the food or the drinks or both.

Decor is fun - second story place, with a pool table and old fashioned feel.  Service is great.",4
"The cocktails are delicious! Try any of them, you won't be disappointed. Also the fried cheese curds and charcuterie platter are killer. Mac n cheese was a bit bland for my liking.
The venue is trendy and loungey with a lot of young professional types. Great for taking a date or girls night out!",5
Had a great time this evening.  the experienced bartenders. Very impressed overall tonight,5
"High Class place? Not really sure but not my type a place. You pay for a quiet setting and same drink you can get next door for half price in my opinion. Older Alumni and graduates go here more often. I'm an Alum, but still in no rush to go back.",2
"Hands down the WORST service I have ever encountered anywhere.

Group of ten for a birthday party. We called in advance to let them know we were coming and a table was waiting for us on the third floor. That was the last pleasant aspect.

Please bear in mind with this review, we had 4 people who worked and still currently work in the service industry so we are understanding of things taking time, whether its a staff or kitchen issue, etc.

After we were seated we spoke to the server and explained that 2 of us were on the same tab, but everyone else was individual. She said no problem. She then took our drink orders. The special Bourbon menu was also requested at that time as 3 people in our party were interested in ordering (we received it 40 minutes later). Our first round took almost 20 minutes to get to us. There were only 2 other tables upstairs and a bored looking bartender. Our waitress also proceeded to take one drink at a time from the bar to the individual person at the table. It began to become comical after a certain amount of time.  Average wait time for a drink was 20-25 minutes after it was ordered throughout the entire evening. 

When it came to ordering, we had to ask what the special was, and when one member of our party asked what were the ""root vegetables"", our waitress responded with, ""Carrots....um, I don't know, I am a vegan"". Baffling.  Once our orders were placed, the food took almost an hour to come out. Food was hit or miss, salmon was undercooked, chicken pot pie was cold in the middle, pork chop and shepherd's pie were received well, as were the sliders. At this time, our party decided to not order any bourbon due to the ungodly wait for a drink. Our water was also never refilled and once party member had to ask 3 times for more water.

Now the fun part...the check.
First check came out, everything on one bill. In addition to her not splitting it as we requested at the beginning, it was also wrong. We politely brought this to our server's attention. She then took out a pen as asked us all individually what we had. She then went back and brought back the same check two more times! While one of our party took to a pen and paper to write it out, another member asked our server to speak with a manager. Our server responded with ""For what?"". Unacceptable. The manager was polite and apologetic, but did nothing to even try and rectify the situation. We weren't looking for a freebie, but offering to do something would have been nice. It took over an hour to get the check correct. 

For a large party willing to spend money, this was ridiculous. Had service been acceptable we would have had at least 100 dollars more on the liquor bill, and probably another 100 dollars in after dinner bourbon which was vetoed due to the ridiculous amount of time we had already been there. One member in our party has been a server for over ten years and was fuming. All in all our dining experience took 3 hours.

Maybe I would go back to have a drink at the bar. That would be the only way I would ever suggest to try this place out. Vibe was cool, but unfortunately due to the horrendous service there are 10 people who won't be back.",1
"This place was awesome! It's come a loooong way since The One Eyed Jakes days (UI alums from the 90s will appreciate this). You walk up the long staircase and are met with a beautiful hospitality stand right near the bar and pool table. Our reservation was upstairs another floor and it was very beautiful-high ceilings and great speakeasy decor. My husband and I had the green eggs and ham which were delicious. I had the Havana Slinger for a drink. It was really good. For dinner, my husband had fish and chips which he said were flaky and delicious, and I had the Niçoise salad. I kid you not-it was hands down the best salad I've ever had and I'm a salad girl. Our waitress, who was very sweet and helpful, said that the restaurant brought it back in the menu due to popular demand and I understand why. The eggs were done to perfection, the dressing was on point, and everything just tasted incredible. We felt like we were on a roll and decided to stay for dessert and we are glad we did. We tried this apple cobbler and my husband called it a ""cast iron crock of warm, sweet, crunchy goodness"". It's amazing, guys. We don't live in Iowa City, but I am writing this review in the hopes that all of you locals will be flocking there to keep my Niçoise salad on the menu for next time I'm in town.",5
"Went here for a happy hour and was very pleased with the experience! They have a great happy hour menu (half off draft beer, glasses of wine, and selected cocktails in addition to reduced-price appetizers), and my friend and I were seated immediately. Seeing that neither of us had been before, our waitress was extremely helpful in suggesting popular drinks and menu items. We went with the Devil's Apple and daiquiri cocktails and split the corn fritters and potted crab. Great food, strong cocktails, and exceptional service. A little on the pricey side (hence 4 stars) but 100% worth it!",4
"This place is ridiculously overpriced with terrible service. The bartenders and servers are pretentious, smug, and rude. This place is just pandering to a certain type of customer that will throw their money away to feel ""cultured"".",1
"Great food...good music..Great service.
The hush puppies were perfectly spiced. I had the havana slinger...malbec..both were great!!...
Oh and fix I say..Great jazz music!!",4
"One of the most ""mature"" and cool atmospheres in the Iowa city area.  They paid great attention to detail when the decorated and designed the place.  The food is absolutely amazing as well.  I haven't ever had anything to eat there that I didn't love.",5
"This place is a gem! 

Came to stay with some friends who are as local as it gets, they suggested this place & It was my favorite in the city! I highly suggest getting casually dolled up & enjoying some friday night libations & dinner at Clinton


Location: The doorway is tiny and hidden which actually I think only does the speak easy vibe justice, parking isn't too bad, we found a spot about 2 blocks away with ease, which would have been more then fine except I came during the polar vortex ha.

Ambiance: The inside was well thought out, the dim lighting, from the wood work to the typography on the menus, it was designed beautifully. 

Service: Perfect, our waitress was professional, attentive and knowledgable about the food, drinks and area.

Food: between the 5 of us we ordered all the bests, and our whole table was quiet and smiling to themselves as if they just read a sext. it was THAT good.

Price: Perfectly fair for the quality and proportions.

I would absolutely recommend Clinton Street Social Club",5
We love this place normally - great atmosphere and classic craft cocktails.  Though last night they appeared to be a bit overwhelmed  We ended up waiting over 30 minutes for our drinks with no explanation. Sure they will get things back on track as they are something special here in Iowa City.,3
"Excellent Tapas and drinks

I went Tapa and Bar hopping one night in Iowa City and stopped here with my sister. I love the ambiance and sophisticated aura of the setting. It didn't feel like a typical bar and tailored more towards my tastes. I came here in excitement for the fresh cheese curds. I ordered the Wine Cocktail that had fresh strawberries and other fruits. It was like a wonderful blend of good wine, grape juice, and strawberries! It was quite refreshing. I had the oysters and fresh cheese curds. I absolutely LOVED them. The oysters are extremely fresh and they are already seasoned with lemon juice, garlic and whatever else they put. It's also already prepared so that you don't have to use a fork to take the oyster apart. Every time I had an oyster, I felt like it was pure heavenly delight. I want more! The fresh cheese curds come with a side of ranch. They are indeed fresh and the cheese curds are high quality. 

Alongside those items, the menu is very impressive. The tapas are at reasonable prices. Hush puppies with aioli are only a mere $3. If you share tapas with a group of friends, it won't be too heavy on the wallet.  The only thing I wanted more of was a bit more decor. It felt a little bland and empty inside.  Overall, I love this place!",4
Yum! I always feel so classy when I come here. The cocktails are delightful and fun and the food itself is delicious. I love niche places like this that highlight quality ingredients and I would definitely rank this as one of the best restaurants in Iowa City!,5
"This is one of my favs!!!  The old one eyed jakes turned into a fantastic restaurant. The bar and drinks are really great. The menu items are fun and unique. Have enjoyed most everything on the menu, cant go wrong with any pick. One of the very best in Iowa city!!!",5
I was so close to giving this place a five star review. The food was excellent. I highly recommend getting the cheese curds for starters. I had the fish and chips and that exceeded my high expectations. Best I've ever had. The lone downfall of this place was that the food took forever to get here. And the seats are a little on the small side and you get kinda sore after sitting in them for awhile.,4
"I'm not originally from the Iowa City area and I apparently have different standards for high end bars and ""gastropubs"". The menu was laid out nicely and the French fries were decent.

The staff was, I will say, standoffish. They obviously don't like making reservations and  absolutely could not make them the same day (it was a Saturday), though the reason clearly has nothing to do with dining room space wanting. Once we arrived, we were told they could not move tables and our whole party could not be accommodated at one table (though we did manage to sneak two extra chairs from one of the 4 empty tables surrounding us).

I would like to say directly to the owners/managers, it is exceptionally bad form to keep an open bottle of champagne for 2-3 days and serve it to guests at $7 a glass. If I wanted flat, stale wine I would have stopped by Casey's on my way home (oh, but then I would have found Andre for $4 a bottle, which would have been immeasurably preferable to what I was served).

I can't be sure, but my guess is that the owners/managers look down on the typical Iowa City bar crowd, though why you would want to alienate your primary demographic is beyond me. I sincerely hope your wannabe crowed dining room and the $10 bottle of bubbly you just couldn't waste was worth losing 8 (the apparently enormous size of our party that could not be accommodated) potential regulars.",1
"What a fantastic replacement for the not so great bar that used to be here! The space is set up nicely and has a great ambiance. I had the Blushing Orphan cocktail, half of a Grilled Artichoke, and the Brussels Sprout Salad. Everything exceeded my expectations. I really enjoyed the comprehensive layout of their menu and the variety of items served. Coming from New York City, the cocktails were more like Manhattan prices than Iowa prices. But, everything tasted great and the service was excellent. I really enjoyed seeing a Cava on their wine list, as Spanish wine is excellent.",5
"Great food, great drinks, great staff. This place is a diamond in the rough....literally.",4
"My friend and I are new to town and we went to the Clinton Street Social Club per the recommendation of a local. We were more than impressed with the quality of the drinks and, even more so, the service. Our waiter, Lou, was able to provide a detailed explanation of the drinks we had questions about and offered phenomenal recommendations based on our preferences--not to mention the fact that he was easy on the eyes. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and an inviting environment. Overall we had a wonderful first experience and we can't wait until our next visit.",5
"What a fun little find!  

We ordered nibbles like the Cajun spiced nuts and cheese curds and drank lots of beer.  The atmosphere was very chill, a nice change of pace from the rah rah Hawkeye bars downtown.  

Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the beer offerings, and they even serve mead!  I don't know about full meals here, but for a cozy place to meet up when you just want to get warm and tipsy and chat about nothing, this is perfect!!!",4
"I live for Clinton Street Social Club. Best cocktails in town and probably the best fried cheese curds in existence. The wait staff and bartenders are top-notch and the atmosphere is a place where I actually want to spend time. The staff has always accommodated my request to leave out pork where possible, a request that usually receives eye-rolls at other places in town. (We are, after all, in Iowa.) It's quickly become one of my go-to places to bring out-of-town guests, who all leave very impressed. Bottom line: this is an adult-ish bar with great food, killer drinks, and a fantastic staff that don't judge you for bellying up to the bar several nights a week for delicious cocktails and cheese curds that you will only find here and in heaven.",5
"Good food, nice ambiance. The menu had a very extensive cocktail list and a much smaller food selection. But it is a ""social club"" so that's what you should anticipate. The food that is listed however is pretty good. But is it so good that you shell out about 40$ per dinner.... I don't know about that. Fries are rather ordinary... Save yourself the dough on that... Frozen fries from Costco taste better. Great food at a high price.... You're paying for the atmosphere as much as if not more than the food.",3
"Overview: Clinton Street Social Club is a speakeasy with great booze and a schizophrenic kitchen that is equally amazing and disappointing.

Location/space: The Social Club is located above Short's burger directly across the street from the Old Capitol. The interior is wonderfully decorated with exposed brick walls and metal accent pieces that evoke a turn of the century speak-easy. The dining area itself is very modest and divided from the bar area by a staircase leading to the third floor. There's also a pool table and occasional live music.

The Food: The restaurant serves mainly smaller portioned appetizers meant to be shared among the group of diners. These range from small slider sandwiches and charcuterie to more substantial dishes like Shepard's pies and flank steak.

Since the restaurant is still fairly new (within its first year), the food has a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde quality to it: some days its amazing, other days not so much. For instance, the pork belly was luscious, tender, and flavorful the first time I ordered it, but when I talked it up to friends and returned a month later, the pork belly was dried-out, overcooked, and a major letdown after the first experience. Similarly, the first time I ordered the hush puppies, they were perfectly cooked with a crisp golden shell while a subsequent order produced darkened hush puppies that had clearly stayed in the fryer a bit too long. Finally, an unexpected and very pleasant surprise was the apple bread pudding, which had a lightness and balance of flavors that managed to draw warm praise out of a guest who normally hates bread pudding.

The drinks: This is clearly the Social Club's strength. They have a wonderful selection of beer, wine, cocktails, and spirits (which includes an awesome collection of whiskey). The Grandpa's Coffin, in particular, is fantastic and worth the steep price.

Summary: Clinton Street Social Club is a great downtown bars for those who are looking for a reprieve from fraternizing with undergraduates in a dive bar or club. The drinks is clearly the Social Club's forte, and its food will steadily get better as the kitchen staff gains more experience with the still relatively new menu. In short, this place has the potential to be something amazing. Time will tell whether it can achieve that level on a consistent basis.",3
"It doesn't seem so long ago that this place was sticky with cheap beer and Jaeger shots and girls in unfeasible footwear sliding down the stairs on their mini-skirted backsides. At one time, there was a cage in the corner for people who like to dance in cages. It was also a favorite hangout for the local police's PAULA squad. And if you were turning twenty-one and wanted to regret your birthday or just forget it forever, this was the place to come. Of course, that particular establishment is now defunct and the college kids have to go elsewhere to abandon their dignity. In its place, tucked away above the very popular Short's, is the Clinton Street Social Club.

Well, how about this for a transformation! The Social Club is all exposed brick work, dark wood and moody lighting. There are hipster dudes in hats sitting at the bar, and the wait staff exudes the sort of louche ambivalence that keeps the place very, very cool at all times. It's probably several years since I've actually been cool myself, but nonetheless, I didn't feel entirely out of place here. For starters, the décor is actually pretty nicely done, and if you go before sundown and snag a seat by the big windows at the front of the building, you can command a magnificent view across Clinton Street and over to the Pentacrest. The menu is better than average, although as a few other reviewers have noted, the actual quality of the food that's delivered to your table is a bit variable from visit to visit. I was disappointed when they stopped doing those fabulous little goat meat sliders, and even more disappointed when I tried the fish sliders instead. Those had to go back to the kitchen. On the other hand, I've had a couple of very agreeable sandwiches here - including a nice, juicy po' boy - and the appetizer snacks, especially the cheese curds and the fries, pair very well with the small but carefully picked draft beer selection. I understand that the cocktails have a good reputation too, but I'm not much of a cocktail drinker so I can't say for certain. Also, they probably have the best range of American whiskeys in town; it's not a huge or exhaustive collection or anything, but there are some pretty choice bottlings nonetheless. Service is fine, if rather too cool for school, and the prices are about what you'd expect from venues in this category.

All in all, the Clinton Street Social Club really classes up this space. It's quite a change from the previous incarnation. Now you can sit on high in a state of relative tranquility and watch Iowa City's latest assortment of student douchebags duking it out on the sidewalk below, and you just know you've graduated to a much, much cooler place.",4
"My two adult sons and I were very underwhelmed by our experience here. The atmosphere is cool: upstairs, view of the Pentacrest, low lighting. But the food was disappointing. I had the fish and chips. The fish pieces were big, too big to be eaten by hand. The batter was greasy and fell off the fish, so it became a big pile of fish and batter on the plate. The taste was bland. And the chips were just big french fries--not crisp chips, and nothing special in flavor. 

The deviled eggs sounded great--blue cheese, something else and bacon. But, they tasted just like normal deviled eggs with a tiny piece of bacon stuck in the filling. 

One of my sons had the cheese fondue. It too was bland--that was the theme of the night. A weird cheese flavor, not strong and cheddary or just yummy, and pretty plain bread for dipping. My other son had the cheddar burger, which was heaping and good, but we could go anywhere for a good burger, and his fries were just smaller versions of my ""chips""; again, nothing special. 

The menu and self-description sound appealing, but the delivery is disappointing. We won't be back any time soon.",2
"Fun place in downtown iowa city.  Good food, GREAT beers.  Fun scene.",4
"One of the best places in Iowa City! I come here a lot. Consistently good food and drinks. Love the dark-lit atmosphere -- it's cozy and sophisticated. Not too many undergrads frequent the place, which is great.",4
This place has great food.... for Iowa City. I love their cheese curds and their old fashions! I also really enjoy the atmosphere. I recommend!,5
"sucks. eaten here twice, food was terribly disappointing both times. People tell me the cocktails are good but honestly I thought the food here is so inedible it's not even worth giving a third shot.",1
"I'm so glad Clinton Street is in Iowa City. They get everything right: good service, the best drinking selection in Iowa City (good quality libations!), delicious food and a great atmosphere. They've got a variety of small to larger plate options and sometimes my friends and I like to just come to drink and get a variety of dishes to share. Definitely an older crowd -- young professional and graduate student vibe.",5
"I have been here many times, every experience is amazing.they are super good at the Stuff on their memu.",5
"This place gets better each time I go. The first couple times I went, the service - even though both times our servers were incredibly kind - was slow. That was not an issue at all the last time we went, and the service ended up being one of the highlights of the night because everyone (the hostess, waitress and a random worker that directed us to the bathroom) was so friendly and attentive. I needed a reservation for 10 people and emailed the restaurant my request to receive a response only a few hours later from the owner, which was really convenient. I had the summer salad which was delicious and shared cheese curds and a bucket of bacon (both also delicious) with my friends. Overall this is a really great space that I'm proud is in our town.",4
"Clinton Street is more than just a restaurant, but an eating experience. While the menu is small, they have different options for sharing small plates or having full entrees. The cocktails are interesting and the full bar has many options to choose from, including tons of whiskeys. There is a pool table on the second floor, with tables and bars on two floors. As for the food, the Vintage Chedar Burger was juicy, and the toppings all went welll together, with the aged cheddar, grilled onion, bacon, and mustard providing a well-balanced flavor profile. The only problem was that my mouth was not large enough, but it was delicious nonetheless! Make sure to check out their facebook page for ongoing events and specials (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Clinton-Street-Social-Club/474651545887180) like live music. Eateries like Clinton Street are among the standouts that are helping to nudge Iowa City from the college bar scene to a more balanced, reputable, and inviting place to enjoy, without being inundated with under-age drinkers and watery beer.",4
"I went here for lunch with a group of six. We were seated in the downstairs area and there were two other tables of people when we got there. 

The place looks nice, although I was sad to see the bar from Jake's is gone. Despite the reputation of the place, Jake's had a pretty nice setup downstairs. Regardless, the new decor is an upgrade for sure. 

My party ordered some of the garlic nuts, fries, and fried cheese curds as appetizers to share. The nuts came out within a few minutes in a cute jelly jar. Easy to share, very tasty. The fries and cheese curds came out at least 20 minutes later. Warm, but not hot. The fries were tasty, but a bit on the soggy side for my taste. The cheese curds were served in a small bowl, which left the curds on the bottom absolutely swimming in oil. The curds on top were great.

For the main event my party ordered mac 'n cheese, the soup of the day, various sliders, mashed potatoes, the heirloom tomato salad, mushrooms, and a burger. These dishes trickled out of the kitchen over the next hour. The sliders were served on ridiculously large plates. Who cares about plates though, the real issue with the sliders was the temperature. Two different versions of their sliders were ordered by three people and every one had the same complaint. The burger part of the slider might have been hot at one point, but the bun was cold. Straight out of the refrigerator cold. Not at all pleasant to eat. The only full-sized burger that was ordered was declared good, but the bottom bun was soaked in oil or grease. Again, not pleasant. The mushrooms were smushy and boring. The mac n' cheese was well received. Lots of flavor in a creamy cheese sauce. The mac 'n cheese orderer in our party was also the person that ordered the soup. Oddly, the soup was one of the last things to come out of the kitchen and had been completely forgotten about by the time it arrived. It was also declared yummy. The very last thing to come out of the kitchen was the mashed potatoes and gravy. This was made all the more frustrating as we had already been sitting in the restaurant for more than an hour and the person that ordered the mashed potatoes had gotten one of first sliders to come out of the kitchen. She'd been done eating for quite a while when an absolute mountain of mashed potatoes arrived at the table. The portions for every other thing we'd ordered had been reasonable, then those arrived. Completely bizarre. 

Oh, and a note on the heirloom tomato salad, not yummy. Five thin, sad slices of a garden variety red tomato. Boring.

The real fun started when the check arrived. We were a party of six women out to lunch at a place that was not busy at all. Our waitress didn't even offer to split the check. When we had two people with credit cards and four with cash, it was a complete cluster %$&# to get the payment situation figured out. Since we wrote down what should go on each credit card we really couldn't see what the problem was. We've all been to restaurants before and we all know that different payment methods are just not that complicated. It sure was @ this place.

The drink menu looks interesting and I wish we'd had time to sample some of them, but after an hour and a half for lunch we were ready to get the hell out of there.

Try it if you must, but don't go with more than two people and don't order food if your time is limited. Most of our social experience at the Clinton Street Social Club revolved around how odd the whole thing was, but it was social none the less.",2
"I have eaten here twice while visiting Iowa City and both times I thought it fabulous. I am a vegetarian and they were very willing to make adjustments to items on the menu to accommodate me.  The food seems fresh and very flavorful, the wine was  a great accompaniment to the meal. The Brussels sprout salad is a personal favorite.  I love the location and atmosphere.  On both visits we had great service.  I love jazz music and they play a fine selection, however, the volume is way too loud for me.  I hope they will consider that many people would like to visit while eating without having to shout.  Overall a great experience.",4
"Wonderful. Best Sidecar ever, and hubby's Havana Slinger house concoction was also delish. Cheese curds were divine. BLT was packed with perfectly cooked bacon, and the steak sandwich was also very good. Last time I had the mac and cheese and it was profoundly  tasty. Non-intrusive wait staff is just the right combination of attentiveness, helpfulness, and leaving us alone to talk. Quirky music adds atmosphere without being distracting. We will be back.",5
I will never be back is the proper way to start off this review....I went here last night with high hopes that this would be a great new spot to hit up....the atmosphere is very relaxed and upscale and the drinks are on the pricier side thus why it is called a social club but it was the service that will be the reason I never come back when ordering a drink not only did it take ten minutes for a drink at a place that was next to empty but then the bartender asked my friend if he was okay trying to say that he was passing out even verbally saying so when he was simply looking down at the table and had only had a couple drinks in him then to top it off I continually watched the bartender not only watch and stare down my friend the whole time but also talk about him to several of the other waiters and bartenders who then also gave him dirty looks based on the awesome comments that the bartender must have made to his coworkers about my friend.....I was very displeased and there is absolutely no chance I will be back....I understand having a bad experience but I don't come to your bar to be singled out and be made fun of by your bartenders.....the only reason you got a 1 is because a 0 isn't an option.,1
"Second trip here.  My cocktail was served in a rocks glass, when I asked about what drinks come in shorter ""neat"" glasses, the bartender responded that any drink can come in any sized glass.  I ordered 2 dishes, one came with info that the other was out of stock and the one dish that did come came undercooked.  2nd visit and things were lookin' down.  Bartender ordered some duck corndogs for me on the sly and saved the day.  Like i said in my previous review, you must be patient while working out kinks.  Go here, seriously!",4
"Food looked good. Too bad came after 10pm, couldn't order food. They have a great variety of drinks. I got the wine/coke/lemon deal that was good.",4
"Clinton Street Social Club is a great new find for downtown.  Their menu includes Duck Confit, Hanger Steak, a Goat slider, and Poutine! The bar on the main floor is a neat crafted wood with the edges left semi-finished. Very good tap list, with the Belgians upstairs. No lunch on Sunday or Monday.",5
"My husband and I stopped here for a late dinner on Halloween night. The decor is sort of 1920's speakeasy. Its casual but also a bit upscale...you don't have to get all dressed up but if you wanted to get decked out for a night on the town you wouldn't feel out of place (although with it being Halloween, I'm not sure if I could really know much about the typical dress code : ) ). We didn't have a reservation, so we put our name in with the hostess and had a drink at the bar. They have a pretty extensive drink list. I had one of their fall specials, the Pear and Ginger Smash. It was excellent! My husband had a tequila and mezcal cocktail (can't remember the name) which he also really enjoyed. We were on our second round at the bar without being called to our table so my husband checked in with the hostess. Turns out she had thought we left! Woops. But, they comped our second round (not necessary but very much appreciated) and took us to a table right away. For dinner we shared an order of the sweet corn hushpuppies, the brussel sprout salad and the roast chicken. We had heard good things about the pork belly and had originally wanted that, but they were out so we went with the chicken instead. Everything was truly delicious. The hushpuppies came with a spicy aoli which really made them special. I recommend doing what we did, and ordering sort of tapas style so everyone can try a bit of everything. They make it really easy to share by how they plate everything, and give you extra plates without you having to ask. I would definitely come back if I find myself in town again.",4
Half priced beer happy hours woo hoo!,5
"Wow..we ordered two simple entrees and were rather amazed. I got the Mac and Cheese and she got the fish and chips, both prepared very well and a great deal for the price.  Looking forward to trying more on the menu.   Only draw back was server was a little inattentive, but it was a Sunday night and she was on her own.  Still coming back.",5
"I love the place. Great music, great bar, awesome pool table. Food not overwhelming, though.",4
The rating is purely due to the location. Literally the only bar in town that can mix a decent cocktail. Like the only one.,5
"Five stars because there's so much potential here and after only being open for two months I see it getting better and better.  I'm actually surprised after reading the reviews because all of the times I've been there It's been packed!  The food is a little slow, yes, but seriously the place was PACKED!  And I didn't mind because the drink menu was so great and original.  Great prices on drinks, and by far the best atmosphere for us grown-ups.    

This place seems to be as casual or as nice as you want it.  The best things I had:  The cheese curds (oh my)!!!, The Burger (better than anything else in town), Duck Confit and Pot Pie (YUM)! and all of the cocktails!!!",5
The food was not good and service was not friendly. I would recommend there cocktails!!,2
"Wow have times changed in downtown Iowa City. When I was in college this space was One Eyed Jakes, the best place to go when turning 21. Now this space is an elegant semi-formal restaurant/lounge with a nice casual vibe in downtown Ia City. The bar is very well situated and the menu  was appealing. I ordered the oyster po-boy and it was pretty good. It was too big and messy to pick up and eat as a sandwich, but it was good even though a fork was needed. The oysters seemed fresh, so that was a treat.  I would recommend a seat close to the window so that you can look down on Clinton Street.",4
Great building. Loved the big windows overlooking the university of Iowa.  The service was mediocre. I had a grey goose Martini. The first two had no vodka in them.  When i sent the second one back I think they waved the bottle over the glass and called it good.  So If you must go get a bottle of wine or a bottle of beer. Food was ok.  we ordered root vegetables with our meal and we had to remind them after everything was brought out so they came late but they were hot unlike the rest of our food.  Not planning on going back!,2
"Love the food, love the service. If you are in a hurry sit at the bar, though. Can be rather slow at lunch. Their BLT is the best I have ever had.",5
"Dinner and cocktails on a Friday night. Place was packed which I took as a good sign. We ordered classic cocktails (negroni and an old fashioned). I got an americano, which is close to what I ordered, but not right. The server definitely got the name right so the bartender didn't know what she was doing.... The old fashioned was not great.
We ordered the cheese curds and romaine salad to start and they were both fantastic! Both were perfect sharing size and tasted great.
For the second course I ordered wine which came in a short ""juice"" glass. I get that it may fit the theme of the place to serve it that way but it is impossible to enjoy and actually taste red wine when not served in a proper glass. 
I ordered the veg slider, which as others have said was served on a cold bun with wilted greens on the side. Not terribly appetizing. We had ordered a side of mayo that I added to it that helped a little bit. The cauliflower gratin was a tasty preparation of an otherwise boring veggie.
I'll definitely go back and try some other things, I feel like the place has potential. I just know now what they can make work and what they can't....",2

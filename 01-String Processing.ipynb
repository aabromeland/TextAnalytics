The ambiance is great, with a retro warehouse feel and beautiful views out onto the Pentacrest. Their real attraction is the drinks list: many interesting cocktails, my personal favorite being the Grandpa\\'s Coffin (bourbon, scotch, locally made apple brandy, and bitters). They also have a \"Murderer\\'s Row\" of high-end whiskey should that strike your fancy. I\\'d say this place competes with Devotay for best cocktails in Iowa City. They also have a well-chosen, if small, beer list, and I have had good times with their wines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food has been very good. Last night, I had their smoked salmon nicoise salad, which had excellent flavor, and my wife had a tasty vegetarian quiche. They used to carry a really flavorful veggie burger, but appear to have dropped that from the menu within the past couple of months. On another visit, the salmon entrée was also good, though less memorable than the nicoise salad.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s neat about this place is that it\\'s consciously striving to be a new cultural hub downtown. During a visit for Mission Creek I saw that they hosted jazz and poetry readings. They also have darts and pool tables off in side rooms, in a perfect environment for that kind of thing. I see lots of young professionals and UI faculty here, to give an indication of clientele. I will be returning, frequently.'"

The ambiance is great, with a retro warehouse feel and beautiful views out onto the Pentacrest. Their real attraction is the drinks list: many interesting cocktails, my personal favorite being the Grandpa\\'s Coffin (bourbon, scotch, locally made apple brandy, and bitters). They also have a \"Murderer\\'s Row\" of high-end whiskey should that strike your fancy. I\\'d say this place competes with Devotay for best cocktails in IowaCity. They also have a well-chosen, if small, beer list, and I have had good times with their wines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food has been very good. Last night, I had their smoked salmon nicoise salad, which had excellent flavor, and my wife had a tasty vegetarian quiche. They used to carry a really flavorful veggie burger, but appear to have dropped that from the menu within the past couple of months. On another visit, the salmon entrée was also good, though less memorable than the nicoise salad.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s neat about this place is that it\\'s consciously striving to be a new cultural hub downtown. During a visit for Mission Creek I saw that they hosted jazz and poetry readings. They also have darts and pool tables off in side rooms, in a perfect environment for that kind of thing. I see lots of young professionals and UI faculty here, to give an indication of clientele. I will be returning, frequently.'"

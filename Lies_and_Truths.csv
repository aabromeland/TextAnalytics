ID-0205,PID-0103,ADSVYOL1W08WO,"I have never purchased a George Foreman grill; the infomercials alone were enough to scare me off. When I moved into my apartment a few months back, I realized that my roommate, the consummate college student, had a George Foreman Next Generation grill that he never used, and I figured it was worth a shot. Maybe the former boxing champ slapped his name on something pretty stupendous, if it's been around this long, right? The result was less than stellar.<br/><br/>I bought a couple steaks as the first and final test of the product; it's hard to screw up a good steak, after all, so regardless of how hit-or-miss the product was, I'd still eat well. The George Foreman grill took a good 15 minutes to warm up, and went from ""stone cold"" to ""nearly on fire"" almost instantaneously after that. The steaks didn't cook evenly, the non-stick surface didn't, and cleaning the thing is a nightmare unto itself. I can see how a college kid would love this thing, and for that it's fantastic.

To start off when we arrived to check in, they could not find our reservation and the staff that was working there was extremely rude. They were confident that there was no reservation under our name so i went through my emails and showed them the one i received from them almost a month earlier. Finally after about 20 minutes we received our keys and headed to our room. When we got to our floor they were doing construction in our hallway and being very noisy. I went back to the front desk and requested that we be moved to another floor where there was no construction going on. they advised me they had no other rooms available but assured us that the construction would be done before 4pm. After going back to our room we found the room very dirty and run down. Paint was peeling from the ceiling and there were a lot of stains in the carpet. At this pint i decided not to make a big deal out of it until after we came back from dinner. We returned to the hotel just after 7pm and they were still doing construction on our floor. I wouldnt have minded the construction if it wasn't for the fact that they were very loud and drilling and cutting things with saws. I returned to the front desk again and requested to speak to a manager. After waiting for almost 15 minutes the manager finally arrived. We asked to be moved to a different room again and the manager finally agreed to move us to a suite for the same price we paid for our room. When we got to our room we found that is hasn't even been cleaned yet. The bed sheets were on the floor and there was trash everywhere. Apparently house keeping hasn't cleaned the room yet even though by now it was almost 8pm. At this point i was pretty upset and started to call surrounding hotels. we finally found another hotel that had a room available about a mile down the street. We went back to the front desk and spoke to the manager again. We requested a refund and the manager oked it. This was the worst experience ive ever had at any hotel, and to find out they still haven't refunded or 3 days to my credit card.

ID-1145,PID-0573,A2N3URJ69JQYCM,The XV Beacon is an overrated full of itself hotel in snobby in the Beacon Hill neighborhood ofBoston. The rooms are atrociously small and really only suited for one guest. When traveling with a companion it is a very cramped stay. the hotel has seen better days. There are chips in the furniture and worn carpets in the halls. Many of the rooms look directly into office buildings and the window shades therefore are pulled up from the bottom rather than down from the top for privacy. this means that light only comes in from the top of the windows and gives the rooms a cave like feeling. One of the worst things about the hotel is the location. There is nothing in the immediate area as it's mostly residential. Going out at night requires a drive to get anywhere and the valet parking service is slow.

ID-0395,PID-0198,ARS9S21GQCFY4,"After having this phone for a period of approximately 20 months, I can accurately say that this phones glamour lost its luster a long, long, long time ago. In the beginning, I absolutely loved the phone. It was fast, vibrant and just an all-around amazing phone to handle. And then the cracks in the foundation started to show.<br/>Within about a month of handling the phone, a slightly visible vertical line of dead pixels appeared down the center of the phone. It was hardly a disturbance because I could only really see it if I angled the phone a particular direction. Thus, naturally, I thought nothing of the phone. But, then, one day, a few months later, I awoke to approximately 15% of my screen covered in green-colored dead pixels. To say the least, I was mortified. There were (and still are) parts of my phone that I just don’t see any color whatsoever besides these horrid and circular dead pixels. <br/>After adjusting to that problem, another problem cropped up: the battery life. Prior to this dead-pixel fiasco, the battery life on the phone seemed to last for days on end (and this was with extended use). But, then, again, one day, the battery life just seemed to not be able to hold a charge through out the day.

ID-0146,PID-0073,A2PKAZX1P044Z3,"I bought the Weather Direct forecasting system by La Crosse Technologies because I wanted to have an indoor-outdoor thermometer along with something that could provide me updates in case of severe weather. The product was easy to install, with step-by-step instructions to guide me through the online setup process. One of the most important features to me was the ability to customize forecast and warning alerts for my area. I went to the La Crosse Technologies website, entered my ZIP code, and then it walked me through a long list of the various weather warnings, watches, and advisories and asked for my notification preferences. I could set it up to either not warn me at all, display a visual message only, or give both an audible and a visual message when the warning or advisory is issued for my area. Being in the Midwest where we can get just about any kind of weather, I appreciate getting notice of winter storm warnings in the wintertime and severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings in the summer. <br/><br/>	The display unit doesn't take up a lot of room, but it is versatile in that it can stand up on a desk top like a picture frame or it can be hung on a wall. There were a variety of trim finishes to choose from, including a wood-grain look or a brushed nickel-appearing border so I could choose one to match my home's décor. The outside temperature display blended in perfectly with the siding on my house, so it is conveniently out of the way and doesn't look out of place. Plus, it's wireless, so I could put it where I wanted and not be tied down by how long the cord was or have to drill a hole through the wall to install it and connect it to the inside unit. The display is large and easy to read and provides all the key information I want at a glance including temperature, cloud cover, and even the sunrise and sunset times for my area. The La Crosse Technologies site also offered links to even more information online for a small monthly subscription, such as lightning strike maps and other hard-to-find data, so someone with a more serious interest in weather can have access to the same data used by meteorologists.<br/><br/>	The forecast accuracy is as good or better than the weather service forecasts. A team of experienced meteorologists makes the forecasts from their headquarters in La Crosse, Wisconsin, so they are well experienced in all types of weather forecasting and for the Midwest in particular. There have been a number of days where the local TV station forecast was off by 10 degrees or more, but the Weather Direct forecast was right on!

It must have been off-season, because the hotel was nearly empty, and that apparently meant there wasn't enough staff to do anything. On Day Two of my stay, my room was still not cleaned by 12:30 p.m., which I found out after stopping back at the hotel to change clothes after spending the morning in town. I made a call to housekeeping at that time, then left the hotel to meet folks for lunch. When I returned about 3:00 p.m., my room was still not cleaned, and I had to call housekeeping again. I again left to walk through the historic district nearby. When I returned at 5:30, I again had to call housekeeping - this time I told them I would wait right there until someone finally came to time how long it took. About 15 minutes later, someone finally came to clean the room. Later that night - that maid had the audacity to knock at the door to ask for a bigger tip. When I checked out the next day, I tipped the valet - who came back a few minutes later on foot. She couldn't move my car because it's a standard transmission, she said, so I'd have to get it myself.

ID-1219,PID-0610,A3OBAGGN5YN9DE,"We stayed at the Cannery Pier Hotel a few months ago, and I have to say, we were sorely disappointed... After all the reviews we'd read online, all the beautiful pictures, we may just have gotten our hopes up too high, but it really wasn't what we were expecting.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it's a cute, kind of quaint little hotel. It looks beautiful, sitting out on an old pier over the Columbia River. Unfortunately, after seeing the condition of the pilings for the old piers immediately adjacent to the hotel, we had to hope that our room was on a high enough floor to stay above water if some kind of disaster struck.<br/><br/>We stayed in one of the One Bedroom Suites, and while it was a very nice room, I would have thought that for how much they charged it'd be a little bigger at least. It wasn't cramped, but definitely smaller than we expected. And as much as I hate to nitpick, the mattress on the bed felt cheap, with springs that turned into nothing but pressure points when you climbed into the bed. <br/><br/>The jetted tub was a nice touch, and was certainly cozy. But a window directly adjacent to the tub left it a little lacking in privacy, especially since there was another hotel that directly faced the corner our room was on, and it took us a bit of fiddling to figure out how to raise the privacy blinds (yes, it came *up* from the windowsill) in order to really be able to relax and not worry that someone in the hotel across the way had a pair of binoculars pointed our way.<br/><br/>While some people may enjoy the complimentary wine and lox they serve in the evenings, someone like me who has a severe seafood allergy has to avoid the whole lobby area during that time because coming into any contact with fish (of any kind) will end up sending me to the hospital. <br/><br/>Many people I've talked to simply raved about how ""cool"" it was that they had these old towncars to chauffeur you to your restaurant for dinner. Well, the one time we took a ride in the Buick they had there, we both developed such horrible headaches from the exhaust fumes from some kind of leak (seriously, don't they know that carbon monoxide is toxic???) that we had to ride the whole way there with the windows rolled down. In the summer that may not be such a bad thing, but in the winter, when it's raining? Thankfully our restaurant was very near the hotel, but by the time we got there, we were both freezing. We didn't take the towncar back, but rather called for a taxi.

I booked a package deal which included ferry tickets, a champagne brunch, and two nights at the famed Fairmont Empress hotel.<br/><br/>I kept our hotel location a secret from my husband until we arrived, and I'm so glad I did! After we docked and cleared customs and emerged into the brisk air, we rounded a corner, and got our first look at the majestic old building. It honestly looked like a storybook castle with its pitched gables, gothic Victorian architecture and a fresh dusting of snow. We both audibly gasped. <br/><br/>Once inside, the front desk was busy with other guests from the ferry. My husband and I stood in line but took turns slipping away to poke around the warm, elegant lobby. It had fascinating objects like model steamships and faded photographs of royal and celebrity guests enjoying the hotel's various amenities over the years. We were therefore in a good mood when the customer in front of us threw what might politely be termed a tantrum. The young clerk handled the matter professionally and quickly. By the time she got to us she was incredibly apologetic. By the time we walked away from the desk, we not only had a seriously upgraded room (with a harbor view and free wi-fi) but a lovely written invitation to enjoy a complimentary birthday dessert in the Bengal Lounge! Amazing.<br/><br/>This hotel is wildly romantic in the snow; because of it we stayed largely inside, snuggled into impossibly comfortable sheets and pillows in our luxuriously appointed suite, sampling the abundance of delicious teas (the Empress is famous for their Afternoon Tea service) our room offered. We had breakfast in front of a roaring fire in the Empress Room, which featured heavy dark wood, intricate carvings and ornate candelabra hung amongst tapestries and paintings. We had delicious champagne and curry at night in the Bengal room, overseen by a full-sized tiger (skin, anyway). <br/><br/>This hotel was one of the few I've ever stayed in that I can actually say I was content to just spend time in; wandering various floors, exploring some fascinating history and relaxing in the refined yet comfortable ambiance.<br/><br/>A once in a lifetime stay!",Hotels,pos,T,self,2389,4.8,0.75,5,4437,"[4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]","[F, F, F, F, F, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]","[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]",Y,Y,www.fairmont.com/empress/,-,-,-

ID-0085,PID-0043,A371DGQ1CWZLLN,"The Sanyo ZIO by Kyocera is an entry-level Android smartphone for the Cricket network. It is understandable that an entry-level phone would have limited features, but some of the quirks and odd features of this phone make it difficult to use. Sometimes the touch screen is not very responsive – you have to try multiple times to move your finger across the screen to answer the phone. At least the phone does have a green answer button so you don't actually have to use the finger stroke to answer the phone. The virtual keyboard is cramped, making it difficult to type accurately. When trying to hit the delete/backspace option on the virtual keyboard, it is very easy to hit a key for a different character. The speed can be rather show when web browsing. If the phone is held in one's pocket, it is not unusual for it to automatically call someone in the contact list after small movements cause the phone to become unlocked. Perhaps the most fatal flaw is an apparent defect in the charger interface. After only a few months, it became difficult to insert the charger in a way that would allow the phone to become charged. I was forced to replace the phone simply because I couldn't charge it any longer. This was not a battery issue – the phone simply didn't always recognize when the charger was plugged in, and so the battery would not get charged.",Electronics,neg,T,self,1359,4.3,0.85,2.1,54081,"[2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]","[F, F, F, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]","[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]",Y,Y,http://www.mycricket.com/cell-phones/details/kyo_zio,-,-,-

The television produces very bright colors and looks great paired up with my Blu Ray player.

ID-1129,PID-0565,A1YL1JLSCTVTM5,"When I decided that it was time for a long overdue vacation, I decided to do it somewhere small and laid back. That place was Charleston, SC. Since it had been a while since I had been on vacation, I did a lot of research beforehand. The choices had been between Savannah, GA and Charleston, SC. Since I live in GA, I figured that I could at least leave the state, and when comparing hotels, the pricing for Planters Inn (my ultimate destination) and its accommodations, (as displayed on its website) ended up winning me over. I guess what they say is right, you get what you pay for. Upon arriving to the hotel, it took forever to figure out the parking area and where to pull up to get assistance from the bellhop. There was no real designated area. I ended up having to call the hotel from my cell phone to have them send out someone for assistance. I figure it was just a minor inconvenience and brushed it off. Checking in at the front desk was fine, the young lady that greeted me was friendly enough and I was escorted to the elevator, which was in the process of having its system changed from an old fashion key entry to the key card swipe. I had several problems with this system on my stay, having to go get help from the front desk just to get back to my room several times. I'm an easy going person, by nature, so I didn't let this get to me, but it is still in the back of my mind that this is supposed to be a LUXURY hotel, these little things shouldn't be a problem. Once I make it to my room, on my first night, I figure it is time to settle in. It had been a relatively long drive, for one person, and I wanted to unwind in the big jacuzzi that their website promotes. First of all, finding a suitable temperature for the water was a pain. Warm would go to scorching with just a slight turn of the knob. Eventually I settled on mixing scorching with cold to get the desired temperature. Once in the tub, I realized the jacuzzi jets weren't as strong as I anticipated. They were quite weak actually. Another thing I brushed off because at that point I just didn't care. Once out, I decided to try this 4-star restaurant experience that they boast about and ordered the greasiest, slimiest little glob of foie gras I've ever seen or tasted. To this day, I'm still not sure if it was actually foie gras I was eating. Or attempted to eat. Thankfully I was able to order something else from one of the nearby restaurants. I would like to say that my trip got better over time, but it didn't. I tried the over-priced 4-star restaurant a couple of more times, but in the end ate elsewhere the majority of the trip. The location ended up being great for shopping, and I still say that the staff was pretty OK.

I can use google docs to access shared spreadsheets and make notes during the meetings without having to jot them down on a notepad only to transcribe them later.

I drove up there and arrived pretty late, so I was very tired and ready to get some sleep before the game the next day. After pulling into the small parking lot, I realized after driving around that all the ""Free Parking"" spaces were gone, so I had to drive down the street to a paid parking lot. Then, after carrying my luggage all the way to the hotel, I checked in and, in a sleepy haze, threw my stuff down in the room and went to sleep.<br/><br/>Not more than two hours later, I woke up from incredible itching on my arms and legs, so I quickly turned on the light and realized how awfully dirty my room was. Then I looked closer at my bed near the sheets and I literally could see many, if not hundreds, of tiny bedbugs crawling everywhere. I immediately ran to the desk, where no one was there of course, and after waiting for 30 minutes for someone to show up, I demanded another room. I then got the new room key, went up to it, and after opening the door, I saw that this new room was no more clean than the last. And yes, there were just as many bedbugs in this bed. <br/><br/>I grabbed my stuff and walked back to my car and slept there for the rest of the night.

The hotel is located in the skyscraper district of Shiodome and lies within walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and the famous Tsukiji fish auction, a popular tourist attraction.<br/><br/>The Park Hotel Tokyo's service is excellent and the English-speaking staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms, though a bit small, as is common in Japanese hotels, are clean and have a stylish, modern appeal.<br/><br/>The lobby, which is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower, has a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower and there are often soft Jazz concerts in the evenings, giving the hotel a quiet, calm elegance. In the mornings, the lobby is bustling with patrons enjoying the excellent breakfast buffet. The buffet is not included in the room price, but I was fortunate enough to receive coupons on a couple of visits, and the food was excellent.<br/><br/>And when you're not relaxing in the lobby or enjoying your quiet room, the Park Hotel Tokyo is also within walking distance to several excellent restaurants and there is a Starbucks Coffee located in the basement of the adjacent building, along with a convenience store for late-night snacks or drinks.<br/><br/>The Shiodome area is primarily a business district, so unlike other popular Tokyo hotels, the Park Hotel Tokyo's surrounding areas are quiet on the weekends and evenings, though the hustle and bustle of the morning work rush can be daunting. That it's also a business district, however, means that it's a great hub for traveling, with many Tokyo Metro subway lines running through the area, as well the JR Shimbashi train station, leaving travelers a lot of options to get around.<br/><br/>Also, Shimbashi station is centrally located station, just a few stops from the main Tokyo station, Akihabara, the electronics district, and popular tourist destinations like Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Ueno.<br/><br/>Taking convenience, location, and atmosphere into location, the Park Hotel Tokyo has been and will likely remain my favorite hotel when visiting Tokyo.",Hotels,pos,T,self,2128,4.8,0.7,4.5,2731,"[4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]","[F, F, F, F, F, F, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]","[2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]",Y,Y,http://en.parkhoteltokyo.com/,-,-,-

ID-0335,PID-0168,A1R21R3IXF9CBM,"I purchased this TV on Jun 17, 2011 and would like to say that out of the box it needed zero adjusting. Great picture and the 3D is excellent aside from a little ghosting. My only issue that I am currently trying to reslove with Sony as I write this, is the tv is very thin and borderless. Pretty much the gorilla glass used is the whole front part glued to the back(no screws visible). The glass on my unit has begun to be unglued on the left side of the tv about 2 inches. It is not peeling off but to the point where u can clearly see light coming out of the side of the Tv. This I am sure is not good and am in the process of getting it repaired. Will add to my review if Sony charges for any repairs to this already expensive TV that is clearly a Factory defect.<br/><br/>I am updating my review today October 9th 2011. I am dissapointed to say Sonys warranty and repair Department is the worst I have ever had to deal with in my life. Needless to say, they refused to properly repair this very expensive tv of mine. After 1 month and a 2 week stay at there local repair shop, my tv was returned to me in the same exact condition it was received. Not only did they not repair it but the have refused to replace it for a nondefective one, as the concluded the tv is suppose to be that way. I have posted a Pic of the problem with the glass ungluing and you be the judge and decide if that is normal. I am not telling anyone not to buy Sony products but just be aware they dont live up to there warranty. All this being said, after 1 month of dealing with Sony and there terrible warranty dept., I called Amazon out of desperation to see if they can assist me in dealing with Sony. After explaining the situation to them and a 5 minute hold, I was greeted with a suprise I was not expecting. Amazon rep told me, they were sorry what had happen to me and would be sending out a replacement television and accepting my defective one. All this well beyond my 30 day window. 3 months beyond to be exact. 1 week later my new TV arrived and it is in perfect condition. I am very greatful to Amazon for this and this should serve a lesson to Sony on how to handle a defective product and how to treat loyal customers. Cheers to Amazon and a million jeers for Sony.

I found a pretty good deal on it, pulling nearly $300 off the sales price, but here is where things started to get iffy. It took nearly a month for them to actually ship it out, and another month to get to me. The screen was clearly not fully finished, as I could tell by the plastic sheets sticking out in the corners of the LCD, it was filled with Lenovo bloatware, and they sent me Windows 7 home instead of Windows 7 ultimate. Later on, I realized that the keyboard flexed, and the screen was extremely flimsy, not to mention the entire laptop was extremely heavy and the battery charger got very hot very fast. Best part?

This place turned out to be Charleston, SC. After doing research on hotels in the area, I decided on the Planters Inn on Market Street, a quite luxurious hotel for the area featuring a 4-star dining experience. Upon reaching the hotel the staff was friendly and greeted me warmly. Check-in was a breeze and soon I was off to my king room accommodations. Outside the room was a little round, iron-wrought table set for two overlooking the courtyard. The tall white columns were freshly washed and looked new and fresh plants were out. (The weather was a bit dreary the entire time, so I didn't get to enjoy that feature of the hotel very much.) Once inside with my luggage, the first thing I noticed was a card with my name on it and a teddy bear in the middle of my ginormous bed. The card welcomed me and the bear ultimately became a keepsake for my nephew. The bedroom was beautiful, and the bathroom was just as nice. The first thing I did was take a nice long, hot bath in the jacuzzi. It was the perfect way to unwind after my drive from Atlanta where I'd just barely fled some unseasonable snow. After the bath, I ordered the duck from the 4-star Peninsula Grill and a glass of champagne. It was my first vacation in almost a decade and I planned to live it up! My stay lasted a week, and all in all, each day was the a slightly different rendition of the first. Between sightseeing, visiting shops for gifts and keepsakes, and hitting up a few bead shops for my jewelry line on Etsy, I got to relax in some of the most luxurious accommodations I have ever had the pleasure of partaking in. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, were all friendly and quick to answer any request.

My experience during these months was a complete waste of time. Don't get me wrong, it's an okay system, but it's just not for everyone.<br/><br/>I mostly play online games, so online features are what I look most for in a console. The Playstation Network falls short of what I expected. It's free, which is a plus, but I feel severely disconnected while using it. I have played Call of Duty on an Xbox 360 for years and had a great experience. I tried Call of Duty for the Playstation 3 and it just doesn't compare. <br/><br/>The Playstation 3 lacks cross game chat which allows you to communicate with your friends while playing a different game. I find this somewhat lazy of Sony not to include such a feature. I don't even hear very many people communicating on the same game. I think this is because the PS3 doesn't include a mic with the purchase because mine didn't have one and I had to buy it separately.<br/><br/>The PS3 does have a good single player lineup, but I haven't found any games that I can play with my son other than LittleBigPlanet. I think Sony needs to rethink their business model because they aren't catering to everyone. The Playstation 2 was a decent console with a large variety of games, but they seemed to have dropped the ball this time around. <br/><br/>I also did not like the controller. The back bumpers were okay, but the analog stick placement is really painful on my thumbs. Sony hasn't changed the controller much since the Playstation 1 days and it shows. I really wish I could use the Xbox 360 controller because it doesn't cause cramps on my hands.<br/><br/>I really don't recommend this console to people who like to play online.

I was enticed to stay at Aliante because of a deep discount they were offering. However, our experience was so bad that the hotel should have paid US! The directions on the hotel's website were outdated. The route took at least half an hour longer than if they had taken another freeway. We finally arrived and got up to our room. Despite opening less than a year ago, our room had many things broken or missing. Lights were burnt out, the television remote did not work unless we sat one inch in front of the television, our bathroom toiler paper holder was ripped from the wall and the sink water pressure was horrendous. They also forgot to stock our minibar, despite checking in much later than the usual arrival time. We tried to ignore the poorly-maintained room by dining and gambling downstairs. We first tried their cafe. The service was horribly slow and the food was tasteless. We next tried their Pancake House. The food was covered in vinegar and was disgusting. After those two meals, we drove to the nearest grocery store and prepared the remainder of our meals in the room or ate at restaurants off of the property.

They said they couldn't find my reservation and I had to wait in the lobby for about twenty minutes until finally the manager came and apologized saying there had been a mistake and had found my reservation and could go up to my room. After getting no help in carrying my luggage up to my room, I walked in and a faint smell of chemicals hit me. I'm not sure from what but maybe it was to mask some awful odor from a previous guest. Either way I opened the window to let the smell out and was hit by the obnoxious noises from the street below. So many cars and people made it impossible for there to be one second of peace and quiet. I was told that the location was wonderful but nobody ever told me that while trying to sleep I would be bombarded by all the honks and noise from the street below and that all the lights would seep through my window curtain... at 3 AM!!

For one, the battery life of the iPhone 4 is dramatically less than the 3GS, which never lasted more that a day with constant use either. I find that the battery drops to 50% after using the phone for just an hour, as opposed to the 3GS, which lasted at least twice that amount of time.<br/><br/>Another annoying aspect of the phone is that I tend to either accidentally hit mute or Facetime when I'm trying to call someone normally, which is frustrating because it either makes the other person think you've hung up or decreases call quality. <br/>I find that downloading applications also eats up the battery life on this phone.<br/><br/>The camera, while clear and crisp in quality, tends to freeze up or crash when trying to take a picture and takes forever to load up.

Why would HP want to do this if android is out there and one of the major highlights of tablets today? The screen does not have the ability to be dimmed or brightened that much, and the on board storage is SLOW. The fastest you can transfer to or from the Touchpad is only 1 MB/s, even using USB. Boot up is very slow too, taking upwards of a full minute, while other android tablets take at most 30 seconds.

And again, this is complimentary!<br/><br/>If you want to go out for dinner, the staff will be happy to make reservations for you at any of a number of local restaurants, ranging from laid back pubs to upscale seafood restaurants. And when it's time to go to dinner, one of their staff will drive you to the restaurant in the hotel's 1939 Buick Towncar (I noticed from their website that they've added a 1938 Packard and a 1945 Caddilac). When you are done with dinner, the restaurant staff can simply call the hotel and the car will be by to pick you up. Again, this is a complimentary service. Just part of what makes CPH so special (we did give the driver a healthy tip every night we went out). <br/><br/>Finally, one of the things that actually has stuck with me since our honeymoon (and has us returning there every year for our anniversary, at least for one night) is this: About halfway through our stay there, my wife got sick. I went to the lobby, and asked the night clerk where the nearest drug store was. The next morning, when we came down for breakfast, the day clerk stopped us to ask how my wife was doing.

ID-0145,PID-0073,A2PKAZX1P044Z3,"I received the Weather Direct weather forecasting and temperature station for Christmas from a friend last year. While I've had a life-long interest in weather and was initially excited at receiving the gift, it was difficult to set up and didn't provide information as useful as I'd hoped. The station includes a display console, an antenna that plugs into a computer router and transmits the updated forecast, warning, and outside temperature information to the console, and the outside temperature sensor. The process to set up the unit took about 30 minutes and while it was not difficult from a technical standpoint, the antenna did not easily pick up the outside temperature sensor's data and was difficult to install. <br/><br/>	Once operating, the unit was designed to display the current indoor and outdoor temperature, a 4-day forecast for my local area based on my ZIP code, and provide alerts for various weather watches and warnings that I had selected it to monitor. The outside temperature display worked for about six weeks and never did again afterward. Weather forecast updates came regularly, about four times per day, but the accuracy was questionable. The unit displayed both a graphical depiction of the weather (pictures of sun, clouds, rain, etc. on an LCD display) and the forecast high and low temperatures. It also scrolled the forecast at the bottom of the display console in text format. It seemed that the unit could only display a minimal variety of forecast scenarios and lacked detail such as precipitation chances or if a certain condition was only expected part of the day. The warning feature, which I thought could be a nice component especially for spring and summer severe weather, was slow to update and more often than not gave me alerts for events going on a county away from me instead of for my area. The incident that made me decide to stop using it was when it would only display a “Coastal Flood Warning” for weeks on end (I live in Minnesota, far away from any areas expected to be threatened by coastal flooding)! <br/><br/>	As I found that online sources of information from the National Weather Service continued to have the level of detail and timeliness I wanted, and as the display console basically became just an attractive-looking indoor thermometer and nothing more, I decided to disconnect the unit, and I have not reinstalled it. Unfortunately it was past the unit's warranty period, so I am out of luck for a refund.

Even on lower quality hotels Hilton lives up to the name that is brought by the chain. When I decided on a Hilton, in Chicago, right on Michigan Avenue I expected the best in service and quality. Apparently I was expecting too much.<br/><br/>We were checking in on a Saturday afternoon and told we could not check-in early. We let the valets take our cars, with our luggage, and decided to walk around until we could check-in. Our mistake. We really should have just gone and stood in line. When it came time to check in there were lines that nearly reached the door, even with every counter being attended to. It took us over an hour to check in to the hotel. I am not even sure why because when we checked in it was a matter of quickly processing and then giving us a key. Our check-in did not take longer than five minutes, and the staff was not all together friendly about it. <br/><br/>We went up to our room, which was one of the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in, and even in Chicago the price was bleeding someone dry. The bathroom was a mess of toilet paper just being slung about and the remote had no batteries. This was not a case of the hotel taking the batteries unless they are requested because when I told the employees about the mistake they asked me if I was sure there were no batteries. <br/><br/>We left for the day and returned late at night. I threw the deadbolt on the door, because we were in Chicago at night, and my friend and I went to order dinner from room service. As we were deciding on dinner someone tried to get into our room. A guest. Who had the right key. If the dead bolt had not been on the door the man would have walked in. I pushed the door further closed and told him we were calling management. Management came up, and hardly cared as they explained he was given the wrong key and escorted him away from our room. I asked if we could be changed to a different room and was told we could not because the hotel was full. <br/><br/>Now we slid something in front of the door as well once our dinner arrived to keep any other unwanted visitors away. It did not take long before there was another one. A maid tried to walk right into our room. She asked if we needed the room cleaned. Considering I had never bothered to complain about the bathroom I hardly saw a reason why at nine at night a maid would believe we needed the room cleaned. I once again was calling management, who never got back to me on that one.<br/><br/>Despite telling management of our problems with the hotel, and the staff, and the food (which was overcooked and they tried three times to charge us for something we didn't order) all we received upon check-out was an, “I'm sorry.

ID-0338,PID-0169,A28I5WXPHKRLSC,"I have been using the Miracle Exclusives Stainless Steel Rice Cooker Model ME81 for 5 months now and I couldn't be happier with it! My favorite thing about it is the fact that it is stainless steel--no aluminum or non-stick material. It's very important for me to know that the food I'm feeding my loved ones and myself is not being contaminated by leached chemicals. <br/><br/>Other great features I love about my Miracle Stainless Steel Rice cooker:<br/>- It's simple. No fancy settings--just cook and warm.<br/>- It has a glass lid, not one of the attached solid lids on some rice cookers. <br/>- It's great for cooking almost any grain. In fact I rarely use it for rice. I mainly use it for millet and quinoa.<br/>- Even though it's not non-stick, I was pleasantly surprised that grains do NOT stick to the pot.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a fantastic rice cooker and worth shelling out an extra $20 or so (compared to aluminum rice cookers) for your family's health.",Electronics,pos,T,self,945,4.7,0.7,4.6,1923,"[3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]","[F, F, F, F, F, F, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]","[4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]",Y,Y,http://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Cooker-Model-Formerly/dp/B000I5UEQM,-,-,-

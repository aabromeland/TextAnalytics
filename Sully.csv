"  Great movie. Great telling based on a trues story. ""Miracle on the Hudson.""",50
  Good. Fascinating and educational and gripping all at once.,40
"  I like what Eastwood did with the structure. He doesn't spent the first half of the movie showing the disaster then the second half showing the aftermath. There is tension here beyond just the crash (or water landing). The NTSB simulation scenes were very interesting. I'm not sure if the NTSB was like that in real life, but I did think they were played a little too antagonistically here. I also thought the relationship between Sully and his wife was a little underdeveloped. But those are small issues in what otherwise was a very solid movie.",40
"  A beautiful and powerful film that brings a real life situation to the screen. Tom Hanks stars in this thrilling portrait of heroic airline pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, re-enacting his incredible successful emergency landing of an Airbus A320 full of passengers on the Hudson River.This movie has been out for a few years now, but I hadn't had the opportunity to watch it until recently. Tom Hanks is one of those guys where you know his films will probably be pretty good, at the least, and while I didn't love this film, it was certainly well made.One thing that really stood out to me was Tom Hanks performance. I think that he really brought out the psychological stakes that were present here and he gave us a character to care about. He alone brought so much to this film, but he was accompanied by some other great performances - like Aaron Eckhart.The story is told in a semi non-linear fashion, which I wasn't completely on board with. I think the story, overall, was well written, but it wasn't my favorite. It felt like we were jumping all around the place and the jumps felt kind of out of place. It felt like there wasn't a steady pace and that was my main issue with this film.Despite that being said, ""Sully"" is still a great film. It has its issues and it's not perfect, but it's well made.",40
"  Okay I guess, just not a very compelling character arc (ie not a very dynamic journey for the lead - he was right, he was sure he was right, he missed his wife, he was proven right).",25
"  A beautifully crafted round for Clint Eastwood which proves that even 208 seconds can turn into a well directed movie. Tom Hanks gives a compelling performance as a humble but thoughtful man who knows what is right. Eastwood's vision in the story is clear and rational. The movie makes perfect transitions between post event and current event. The supporting cast is also crafted and compelling as they know what is going on, and display how they feel in a way that accurately displays how someone who was I the cockpit would react differently than someone who was nowhere near what happened. The movie also has pretty well done special effects, and the movie is more believable in that way. Even if the watcher is an action fan, it is far from boring, because I am an action movie fan. Fans of all genres will love and appreciate Sully. Overall, it is a well directed, well acted, and realistic movie in many aspects. I would seriously recommend it, and it is absolutely worth watching.",50
"  Nicely made drama bends the real events into a story, in which the hero is forced to vindicate himself confronted with bureaucratic antagonism.",30
"  By now everyone reading this review would be somewhat aware of the Miracle on the Hudson. This film is based on the hero of that incident- the Captain Sullenberg. Featuring another solid performance by the ever-versatile Tom Hanks and careful direction by Clint Eastwood, Sully is an interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero. The audience always feels connected to Sully's plight as a reluctant target of the media and the post-traumatic stress he goes through in the aftermath of the crash. The only major issue I had with the film is that the supporting characters did not have much to work with. It just seemed like most of their dialogue was there merely to enhance the character development of Sully himself rather than to bring a different perspective to the story. (Incredible look at a hero's moment of valor).",35
"  No easy feat to tell a story everyone knows turned out happily in an interesting and exciting way. Eastwood manages by not giving a shit about chronology, finding just the right emotions and being able to rely on one of the most convincing actors working today. It's also a movie about New York coming together again and healing after events that did not end quite as well a few years earlier.",35
  I spent 14 years of my life as a member of the flight crew on a major airline. This film is awesome. I have no words - it is as near to a perfect depiction of real life as you could hope for. What else can one say?,50
"  So many leading roles like: FG, Castaway, Capt. Phillips, Bridge of Spies, Sully, Pvt. Ryan, accentuate the acting abilities of Tom Hanks. This movie reminded me of the same method Eastwood used on 15:17 to Paris which was also a true story of incredible heroism. The actual flight which landed in the Hudson took such a short time that I'm surprised that the investigation was so lengthy. It was perfect piloting which saved all 155 souls on this aircraft. In 2009 it was a blessing, I can't believe it was 10-years ago almost. Short film, easy to watch and understand, I recommend it.",40
  Tom Hanks brilliant as usual! Really good watch,35
"  Sully is a film that I suggest everyone see this year in cinemas. It is a true story of courage, wisdom and the story of man who made the biggest choice of his life... within a matter of seconds. Please don't let the fact that this film is based on a true story keep you away from seeing this film. - Finesse Movie Reviews",45
"  Boring, obvious, no suspense and such a pathetic portrayal even the bloke it was based on thought it wasn't acceptably realistic.",5
"  The story itself is very simple and mercifully, Eastwood doesn't make this film longer than it needs to be. It is nicely filmed, well-cast and scripted. It is also very polished in that syrupy, feel good, semi-preachy Hollywood kind of way. I was a bit disappointed knowing that Eastwood was the director. Somehow, I expected something more substantial and raw from him versus something safe and full of sheen.",30
"  This movie pays wonderful homage to Captain Sully, and allows the viewer to see what happened in the cockpit and in the cabin.",50
"  An inspiring movie about a real-life hero who saved his passengers using his decades of expertise and calm composure under pressure. We could all learn something from this man, and I am glad that the versatile actor Tom Hanks played the main role!This is one of the best movies I have seen this year.",45
"  Pese a lo b<e1>sico que llega a hacer este guion Clint eastwood logra hacer un gran trabaja de la mano de Tom hanks regalándonos una historia sencilla pero con mucho contenido enriquecedor ,la magnifica figura de heroe que plasman es increíble.",40
  Great story.. Very well done. Tom Hanks is a great actor,50
"  This movie is highly entertaining, yet not too scary. It is well directed and acted. It kept me entertained and made me cry, laugh, and smile a lot!",50
"  Fairly average retelling of an impressive story. Trouble is that everything happened so fast so the film makers have to prolong the story by looking at it through the critical lens of a tribunal. The pilot's love story in the background is kind of shoe horned in but to no real purpose. A great story but not one suited to film, maybe to an hour long documentary.",30
"  Although it does it's very best to flesh things out, there just isn't enough here to stretch into a feature-length film, from both a story and character perspective, something that becomes increasingly obvious the more it goes on; consequently, it feels very thin. That being said, it's wonderfully filmed and well-acted with Hanks performing the hell out of his part. If nothing else, it lets you relive the sheer amazement of the Miracle on The Hudson and re-affirms what most people (especially those on-board that day, you can bet on that) have known all along: Sully is a gosh darn hero who deserves nothing but immense respect for what he pulled off that day.",30
"  There's a few dumb lines early on, but once the drama really starts you can see why this has so many good reviews despite the usually dislikable Tom Hanks.",40
"  Isn't an perfect movie, but Clint Eastwood proof that he's an amazing director,and Tom Hanks, is an great actor for dramatic movies... Captain Phillips was awesome, and he don't does different at this one!",45
"  Tom Hanks is good as always, but this is not his best role. ""Sully"" is a solid, bibliographical film that centers around the miracle landing on the Hudson River, but is not as triumphant as the actual event. Like any recent Clint Eastwood films, it has flaws. For instance, the special effects on the planes can be noticeable and ugly. If a film centers around the crashing of an plane, it has to look real so that we, the audiences, can feel the danger surrounding the characters. Plus, the way the filmmakers ended the film was too abrupt and didn't have any proper ending. It literally ended like it was saying, ""That's it! That's the movie! Not much else to say"". This film clearly proves that Clint Eastwood hasn't been keeping up with today's changes in the filmmaking world. This clearly shows that he's aging and his directing skills will no longer be tolerant as the years goes by. Time to make a change in your storytelling, Mr. Man with No Name.",30
"  A airplane disaster movie without the disaster. To me this movie is a disaster because it is soooo freaking boring nd pointless!!!! Despite the nice camera work and supposedly good acting, you just don't feel the urgency of the movie.",20
  This Movie is amazing I have watched it a number of times and it has even made me join Air Cadets.,50
  You probably won't fully grasp the subject if you're not familiar with the aviation industry.,45
  Highly enjoyable movie superbly told and acted. Incredible story close to the truth.,45
"  45%Saw this on 19/12/16Sully is what you call a lame and inept execution of a potentially strong story. Eastwood shamelessly relies of heavy cliches, card board cut out characters (like that of Laura Linney) and a genuine lack of thrill or excitement. Tom Hanks has nothing to do in here, yet he is ok in it. It is in fact Aaron Eckhart who endows some form of an acting talent is role that is so less important that he can actually be considered only as a mere side kick to Sully. The script of this dramatization does no justice to the real hero as it is just a usual, lifeless work.",20
"  brace for impact..SullyOften biographies takes their time, mostly more than 2 hours or so but this one seems to be to the point and not far fetched, hats off to the editor. Sully brews a soft hearted characters through rough series of events which probably is the only reason why you root for the protagonist from the first frame of the movie; that and of course blend in by excellent execution and Tom Hanks. Clint Eastwood as always justifies each and every character and gives them enough space and range (even the passengers) holding the bits and pieces of the movie with the emotion that comes off it. Tom Hanks is as always magnificent in it and is supported strongly by Aaron through out the course of it. Sully's strength is its runtime which is short and to the point but the problem is that the material isn't sufficient for even that amount of time cornering the feature to rely only upon the performance by the actors and the final act of the interrogation which is the highlight of it.",30
"  Very well executed. I was expecting a cliche reenactment of this amazing event with some randomly chosen characters to develop, but instead the movie offers a different perspective by focusing on the aftermath of the event and undermining the integrity of a marvelous, heroic act. Well-delivered by Clint Eastwood.",40
  Told the story very well I thought.,35
"  Sully ****In 2009 Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger became an overnight hero when his engines failed he landed a commercial airliner in the Hudson river saving every passenger on board. When Sullenberger wrote his book the film was almost certainly coming and come it has. Clint Eastwood is no stranger to directing real life stories after J.Edgar, Invictus, American Sniper it would appear Sully is good hands. The problem with taking on such a story is that the premise outcome is already public knowledge and still very fresh in our minds, but Eastwood focuses on the more unknown aspect of the tale. We see the investigation into Sully that focuses on the point of view that he didn't take the right course of action and did instead make a reckless choice that in danger every passenger on board. We see the private struggle between coping with instant celebrity, be celebrated a hero whilst struggling with self doubt and accusations.  The pacing of the film is a difficult one to get right. After all Clint's one big playing card is the actual landing itself that's the high point after that interest can sway. Eastwood knows this keeping this Ace up his sleeve for half the film then showing it a few times from different perspectives and at different points of the film with every time it being totally engaging.It's hard to imagine anyone other that Hanks in the role of Sully. He captivates his Jimmy Stewart everyday guy to great effect whilst also capturing the characterisation of Sully. Hanks is lifetime competent actor to Sully's lifetime competent pilot and the two combinations truly complement each other.As good as the performance is it can't be truly great as there isn't enough juicy dialogue for Hanks to have or to be able to more diagrammatically delivery as it would deject from the true life aspect of the tale which they seem to rigorously honour. For instance at the most exciting moment of the film during the landing scenes the filmmakers stick to the exact transcript of the real pilots which is extremely limited given the 280 seconds entirety of the event. Most Hollywood films would have ignored that and sexed it up with Sully dodging buildings, ringing his Wife before impact, give a monologue over the meaning of life and then spend 20 minutes landing. No, not here what happened is what's on the screen and that integrity is what is refreshing earnest to see. In fact Hanks did say that the real Sully was often on set and set and lent glorious attention to detail about every aspect of the film for authenticity to real life even down to the pens in the rooms. With this said during one scene at the Marriott a pen and paper sits in the background by the lamp and I had a feeling that was the same one from 2009.Creative licence has obviously been taken for the scenes that make up the movie's main theme which is the investigation over whether Sully was a hero or a dangerous fraud. I'm not sure how much that was amped to give the movie some welly. After all if you're going to have a villain you might have as well make it the National Transportation Safety Board! The NTSB were naturally not impressed with their Pantomime villainy portrayal with a real life Investigator going as far to say it was ""mean spirited dishonesty"". This might explain with a film with so much authenticity they decided to change the names of the investigation team.Other scenes that include back flashes to Sully's very early days of flying do show the scale of the man's career but don't feel tremendously needed and perhaps were stocking fillers to the script.However this is a true life story which has a glorious feel good aspect to it showing us that once in while human beings are capable of conducting some glorious feats. A man who is by no means perfect after forty years experience engaged on a course of action over a mere 280 seconds that defined odds, saved lives and showed in modern times of daily depressing news that Miracles can still happen. And this one happened on the Hudson.",40
"  The ""Miracle on the Hudson"" was a fantastic aviation feat, but Clint Eastwood's movie adaptation is structured unevenly, perhaps to turn a quick dramatic moment into full feature film. That being said, 'Sully' contains a harrowing performance by Tom Hanks and a lot of emotion that comes together to make a decent tribute film to the real hero and the survivors.",40
"  Despite the short 96 minute run time, Eastwood provides a thrilling and enjoyable movie. Tom Hanks shines as Sully and Aaron Eckhart serves as a solid companion as his co-pilot. The cinematography is well shot and the complexities of Sully's decision are explored in great detail. The movie switches between modern day and the real time event for large sections of the film. Both aspects of the film work well, and broadcast the strain such an experience has on one man. The depths of Sully are explored immensely and there is more at stake that he initially realIzes. His wife has a limited role but is essential in adding to the stakes of Sully's decision to land on the Hudson. Despite the investigation into whether Sully could have turned back to the airport, the public hails him as a hero. The final moments of the film providing a thrilling exchange in the trail and Sully's quick thinking turn out to be the right decision, as he saved everyone's life. Overall, Sully is a short but enjoyable film that explores the complexities of the unexpected emergency Sully was placed in.",35
  An inspired retelling of a true story that pulls at your emotions with awesome performances by Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart.,40
"  Very well done film. This is probably the best recreation of an accident I have ever seen and with the best outcome. Plane accidents rarely end up well at all and recreating them would be a downer. Alive comes to mind but it was survival story after the crash and does not end up well for most of them. Sully is basically the story of what can happen when the best of them comes together and are in the right place to do so. A great occasion to be bright and heroic. In the dvd extras, they mention the contrast with the market crash and the greed normally prevalent in NY city, causing it. There are people that do not just want to get filthy rich quickly or screw up other people or use the system.",40
  If you are thinking it would be a long stretch making a movie out of it... you are thinking correctly.,20
"  One of the most remarkable incidents of the 2000s was when U.S. Airways Flight 1549 landed in the Hudson River on January 15, 2009. All of the 155 passengers on the plane survived. This dramatization of the incident, starring Tom Hanks, tells the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who pulled off the Miracle on the Hudson, as it's called. Hanks gives a solid performance as Sully, who is conflicted as to whether or not he endangered the lives of all of the people on board. Aside from the incident itself, most of the movie is dedicated to the debate over whether or not the plane could potentially have returned to LaGuardia. The FAA is made out to be a villain of sorts. Some may argue that this is not as interesting as the incident itself, or that it isn't good movie material. It still works as a film, as it is more about Sully himself than anything else. Director Clint Eastwood does a great job at telling the story, by cutting the incident into several scenes and having the rest be about how it affected Sully's life, and that of his family. After the incident, Sully himself had to deal with PTSD, as well as the stress of instantly becoming a celebrity. His wife and daughters also had to deal with a constant bombardment of attention from the press. This is the focal point of the movie. It's about the people, not the incident. In that regard, it is a very good movie, but if you're expecting it to be about the incident itself, go watch any of the documentaries made about it.",40
"  Really enjoyable movie. Great acting as usual from Tom Hanks, I would watch it again...",40
"  Great movie, very exiting and Tom Hanks was quality, as always. Recommend.",40
"  Excellent movie. Was surprised at how good it was because how do you make a movie about something when everyone already knows the ending and keep it entertaining ? Well, this movie pulls over that difficult task.",50
  3.4/5. 6.8/10.-JDK,30
"  I start by saying that this isn't the best real-life-based movie I've seen, but this one performs his function of informing people about this extraordinary event: in February 2009, Chelsey Sullemberg, a on the way to retire pilot managed to save more than 150 people by landing on the Hudson river. The film begins with Sully that is considered as a national hero, but he does reject this fame, because he's in trouble with the law: computer sims show that he could have landed on near airports without losing any life. But at the court, Sully and his co-pilot and friend Jeff suggest that the 35 secs delay of radio communications should be added to the sims and after that, the computer shows that if Sully hadn't landed on the Hudson, the plane would have crashed. As this movie is directed by Clint Eastwood, i expected more. I mean that some flashbacks are too long so the story is in some ways broken. Beside this, Tom Hanks' acting was convincing and the whole story make sense (trust me, it isn't ever like this). So all in all I consider ""Sully"" an interesting general-culture movie, and I suggest him to guys that have never heard about this extraordinary hero.",30
"  Puntaje Original: 6.5C. Sullenberger hizo lo imposible, y al parecer Clint Eastwood tambi<e9>n, ya que logró convertir un incidente de poca duración en una bien trabajada película de 100 minutos.",35
  Very interesting and informative.,40
  A great real story that would be better off as a documentary. Felt like an over-acted dramatization,20
"  Hanks is fantastic as Sully. In fact, this is a fantastic film. Go watch it.",35
"  (6 out of 6)When we see we must brace for turbulence wherever we are now when some incidents we never saw coming. When what turbulence we feel it is embedded in our nightmares when we see anything could have happened. When other turbulence we don't see when it takes away our focus of reality we don't see. When what we continue to see is the turbulence of it all unfold and the success when news was there to see everything. When what we see is the turbulence in seeing when others see us as hero's while others see us as lucky. When what others don't see quite too often is the turbulence some news makes when looking closer into that day options we could have taken but didn't when our actions are questioned. When what we can't see is how close others look when it's that moment, our state of mind, the outcome and intentions to see there is plenty of turbulence along the way when others need to be clear. When there is plenty of turbulence we go through with money issues, unstable economy, and those that worry about our health. When we see what is turbulent is making others see what it was like to know that we only saw it one way. When we recall non turbulent times when we started off doing what we enjoyed. When turbulence does happen when we are famous hero's to know we steer clear from other crashes. When we see knowing and not knowing is turbulent enough when others think differently in what we can't see. When what we see has no turbulence is seeing the humour and bright side of things. When somethings we don't see when they are routine and just like any ordinary day to not think about turbulence. When what little turbulence others experience is making it on time and others holding us back when there is enough to think about that could go wrong when we live in the time of turbulent nerves. When what we see too late causes turbulence when we see something's crashing into us and other things go wrong. When we see that turbulence happens to be strapped in safely. When what others see too often in turbulence we see where others must go, when protocols are in place others can see where we can go but we go elsewhere less turbulent when its open, safe, and we are good pilot to steer it there. When what others see as turbulent we don't see when it's not protocol we don't follow. When we see we have seen way more turbulent circumstances when we have served our country in the sky. When the whole world waits including ourselves to see what we don't see before we give those the credit that turbulence naturally happens when someone is a star that others look up to that we need to know if he is the right star. When going through somethings we don't see coming we brace for the turbulence when anything could go wrong to do drastic things. When others are turbulent in how they look and how others made us look, when turbulent times within the company & passengers we see turbulence is bound to happen when there is no right or wrong direction to go. When going through such experiences we see that our mind can have turbulence when we are too busy thinking about the worst to let that happen. When some moments we see that what is most turbulent is that we didn't let anyone down by missing out on them, when we only want everyone to be safe. When turbulence amounts we see the pressure, when what we don't see is how relieving some turbulence we don't have to think about that we can focus on other things. When what we know and see we are not 100% in seeing it like everyone else when our credibility is turbulent when what worked out great we could have done better. When what others don't have to worry about turbulence we simulations renders there focus to steer directions they have to go, when feeling some moments of turbulence is no trial & error simulation that you can feel unresponsible for. When we see timing & attempts can be the deciding factor whether turbulence can be seen when no one wishes for turbulence but it happens to steer correctly in what we see is the safest direction. When what we see and feel we operate, we know our focus was there to begin to see where we must go and not go when handling turbulence you require 100% focus and no impairment to deal with it that we see we had during the time. When what others can't see we see to know dealing with turbulence is not textbook. When see bracing for turbulence is hard in which way it might go, to know others where there beside us to see the turbulence and have our back. When we see not many can do what we did when turbulence claims lives but there was a person there to save them. When what turbulence claims in someone's life that once we see it gone we can see how smoothnof landing other things are when it's a new light to live by. When we don't see that our actions is turbulence enough when what we are capable of doing is not in question but what we did with responsibility of passenger lives we did a questionable act that makes some actions turbulent. When what are actions we don't see are recreational flying to know we are aviator pilots to not deal with turbulence that way. When our age is in question, when we are experienced in flying to see all sorts of turbulence to question whether young pilots would get the same light as we do when it's reckless. When split moment decisions in times of turbulence we see somethings we are capable and other things we are not capable of seeing to know as a parent who makes sure that their family is alright in knowing we are alright we know where to steer those on safe grounds when anyother outcomes we feel uncertain or unrelenting we know what direction to go when turbulence doesn't get in the way of our nurturing judgment.",50
  Glad they paid tribute to this man's heroic act with such grace.,40
  this is a quite straightforward film and very much in Eastwood's no nonsense low key style. The emergency landing is deliberately done in a mundane way to highlight the fact it really happened and how the media machine handled the event. I was surprised to see how Sully was mistreated immediately after the sensation died down. Hanks is reliable as ever and everything is solid. Not Eastwood's best but even his average films are good.,35
  Drags it out a bit but pretty exciting in parts and enjoyable almost throughout,35
"  Está película no narra un accidente aéreo, está película narra la historia de como dos pilotos después de salvar la vida de toda su tripulación, son amenazados y acosados por la misma compañía para la que trabajan, llevándolos a juicios arreglados con jueces sobornados, todo esto muestras se muestran pequeñas escenas del accidente y del buen entrenamiento del capitán Sully.",40
"  For pilots or wanna be pilots, I'm sure this is a good movie. But I didn't find it particularly suspensful or interesting. It wouldn't even make for a good documentary. The story just wasn't there.",15
  Great movie!!! Isn't it ridiculous how a hero like Sully is treated after such a deed.,50
"  I just watched this film out of boredom, not knowing what to expect. Good move! This is definitely a film to watch. Engaging and Tom Hanks, as always, nails it!",50
"  Slow in some places, but overall very good. The best part?Official: All our sims are perfect.Sully: You forgot the ""OH SHIT!"" factor.(*sims add in 30 seconds for OSF. all crash spectacularly*)Officials: :O",45

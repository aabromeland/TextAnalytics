       "'  I start by saying that this isn\\'t the best real-life-based movie I\\'ve seen, but this one performs his function of informing people about this extraordinary event: in February 2009, Chelsey Sullemberg, a on the way to retire pilot managed to save more than 150 people by landing on the Hudson river. The film begins with Sully that is considered as a national hero, but he does reject this fame, because he\\'s in trouble with the law: computer sims show that he could have landed on near airports without losing any life. But at the court, Sully and his co-pilot and friend Jeff suggest that the 35 secs delay of radio communications should be added to the sims and after that, the computer shows that if Sully hadn\\'t landed on the Hudson, the plane would have crashed. As this movie is directed by Clint Eastwood, i expected more. I mean that some flashbacks are too long so the story is in some ways broken. Beside this, Tom Hanks\\' acting was convincing and the whole story make sense (trust me, it isn\\'t ever like this). So all in all I consider \"Sully\" an interesting general-culture movie, and I suggest him to guys that have never heard about this extraordinary hero.'"

       "'  a beautiful and powerful film that brings a real life situation to the screen. tom hanks stars in this thrilling portrait of heroic airline pilot chesley \"sully\" sullenberger, re-enacting his incredible successful emergency landing of an airbus a320 full of passengers on the hudson river.this movie has been out for a few years now, but i hadn\\'t had the opportunity to watch it until recently. tom hanks is one of those guys where you know his films will probably be pretty good, at the least, and while i didn\\'t love this film, it was certainly well made.one thing that really stood out to me was tom hanks performance. i think that he really brought out the psychological stakes that were present here and he gave us a character to care about. he alone brought so much to this film, but he was accompanied by some other great performances - like aaron eckhart.the story is told in a semi non-linear fashion, which i wasn\\'t completely on board with. i think the story, overall, was well written, but it wasn\\'t my favorite. it felt like we were jumping all around the place and the jumps felt kind of out of place. it felt like there wasn\\'t a steady pace and that was my main issue with this film.despite that being said, \"sully\" is still a great film. it has its issues and it\\'s notperfect, but it\\'s well made.'"

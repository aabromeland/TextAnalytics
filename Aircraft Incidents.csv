The airplane was parked by an unknown person from Naples Airport Authority after landing several days earlier and according to personnel from the Naples Airport Authority, remained in the same position that it had been parked from then to the arrival of the pilot to depart on the accident date.  The pilot stated that personnel from Naples Airport Authority were busy and unable to take several passengers to the airplane from the fixed base operator (FBO).  During the preflight, he noted the light pole was just behind the outboard side of the right wing.  He obtained his IFR clearance and was cleared to taxi.  He began to taxi without a marshaller and with a row of airplanes ahead of his location, he initiated an immediate left turn to maintain right wingtip clearance with parked airplanes.  During the turn, the right horizontal stabilizer contacted the light pole.  Individuals nearby who witnessed the collision ran near the airplane and got the pilots attention who then secured the airplane.  According to a Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness inspector who examined the airplane, the leading edge of the right horizontal stabilizer and the forward and aft spars of the vertical stabilizer were damaged.  Examination of the area where the airplane had been parked revealed double concentric circles pole painted on the ramp centered on the light pole; the outer circle had a radius of approximately 32 feet.  Radial lines were painted on the ramp from the base of the light pole to the inner circle line.  A north/south oriented taxiway line west of where the airplane had been parked was blacked out; no leadout line was noted from the spot where the airplane had been parked forward to the blacked out taxiway line.",The failure of the pilot to obtain assistance from the FBO in the form of a marshaller and failure of the pilot to maintain clearance resulting in the on-ground collision with the light pole.

During climbout, an airframe vibration developed.  All gauges, readouts, synoptic pages, and airplane controls were normal.  The crew contacted their maintenance base and attempted to troubleshoot the problem, but could not determine its cause.  The vibration remained unchanged until the airplane leveled off at 7,000 feet during an approach.  At that time, the crew felt a bump, then the vibration completely ceased.  The airplane landed, and taxied to the gate without further incident.  Post-flight inspection revealed that the number 1 exhaust fairing was missing, and that the left, aft fuselage had a dent.  The 30 bolts that would have normally attached the exhaust nozzle assembly to the exhaust frame were all missing, ""without a trace.""  Seven months earlier, the tailpipe was found loose.  Ten bolts were replaced, and the rest were re-torqued.  The last inspection on the airplane had been completed about 2 weeks earlier, 105 hours prior to the incident.   Company personnel had previously found cracked bolts on exhaust flanges from other engines.  Laboratory examination of used bolts from another engine revealed no anomalies.  Engine shop buildup and shop exit  manuals were subsequently revised to make the installation and torquing of exhaust nozzle bolts a required inspection item.",Missing exhaust nozzle bolts for undetermined reasons.  A factor was inadequate maintenance inspection of the affected area.

The student pilot lost directional control of the aircraft during a takeoff run while practicing solo touch-and-go landings.  The pilot stated that after a successful landing he initiated a takeoff and, ""as I added power the airplane seemed to shimmy at which time I tried to correct the plane.  As I was unable to correct I powered back to idle and tried to stop which is when the plane went off the left side of the runway and hit a windrow of snow.""  The pilot reported, ""Hitting the snow made the planes [plane's] tail lift and spin around which made the right wing hit the ground causing damage.""  The pilot stated that his total time in all aircraft was 24.1-hours and all hours were flown in the accident airplane make and model.  The pilot reported that he had accumulated 1.4-hours of pilot-in-command time.",Aircraft directional control not being maintained by the student pilot during the takeoff roll.  Factors to the accident were the snow bank and the student pilot's lack of total experience.

The captain stated that prior to departure the flight controls were tested, with no abnormalities noted, and the takeoff trim was set to the ""middle of the takeoff range,"" without referring to any available pitch trim charts.  During the takeoff roll, the pilot attempted to rotate the airplane twice, and then aborted the takeoff halfway down the 4,840 foot long runway, because the controls ""didn't feel right.""  The airplane traveled off the departure end of the runway and through a fence, and came to rest near a road.  The pilot reported no particular malfunction with the airplane.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the horizontal stabilizer was positioned at -4.6 degrees, the maximum nose down limit within the takeoff range.  The horizontal stabilizer trim and elevator controls were checked, and moved freely through their full ranges of travel.  According to the AFM TAKEOFF TRIM C.G. FUNCTION chart, a horizontal stabilizer trim setting of -7.2 was appropriate with the calculated C.G. of 20% MAC.  Additionally, Learjet certification testing data stated that the pull force required at a trim setting of -6.0 degrees, the ""middle of the takeoff range"", was 33 pounds.  With the trim set at the full nose down position (-1.7 degrees), 132 pounds of force was required.","The pilot's improper trim setting, which resulted in a runway overrun and impact with a fence."

During the instrument flight rules initial climb after takeoff, in fog, to visual conditions on top, the airplane collided with the ground about 1 mile from the departure runway.  Prior to departure on runway 11, the pilot contacted the control tower to request the instrument departure to on-top and was advised to standby.  During the course of communication the pilot was advised the ""tops"" were 300 feet above ground level, and was issued a clearance to taxi to the runway.  The tower advised the pilot that they were closing and to contact ARTCC for release.  The pilot obtained the IFR clearance and was released to on-top.  The pilot's release included a standard instrument departure that required a right turn to 130 degrees after departure.  There was no further communication with the pilot and radar contact was never established.  The airplane subsequently collided with the ground, south of the runway, in a steep right wing down attitude on a magnetic heading of 180 degrees.  Examination of the airplane wreckage did not reveal any system anomalies.  The vacuum pump drive shear-shaft was found intact and there was rotational scoring of the attitude indictor gyroscope rotor.",The pilot's failure to maintain a proper climb rate to VFR conditions on-top.

The pilot, who had not ascertained the temperature-dew point spread prior to departure, took off for a local personal pleasure flight in conditions that were conducive to serious carburetor icing at climb, cruise, or glide power. During the 10 minutes that he flew around the local area with the engine at a full-rich cruise power setting, he did not activate the carburetor heat in order to check for ice accumulation in the carburetor throat. When he returned to the airport to enter the VFR pattern, he reduced the throttle to idle at the same time as he applied the carburetor heat. After he turned final and pushed the throttle forward to add power, he discovered that the engine had quit. A post-accident teardown inspection of the engine and carburetor established that there was fuel present in those systems, and that there was no evidence of any malfunction or anomaly that would have contributed to a loss of power.","The pilot's failure to use carburetor heat prior to reducing engine power to idle while operating in serious carburetor icing conditions. Factors include serious carburetor icing conditions, and trees in the area where the pilot found it necessary to attempt a forced landing."

	According to the pilot, following power application after his first touch and go landing, the aircraft assumed an extremely nose high attitude, and he realized he had no pitch control, limited rudder control, and full aileron control. He was able to control pitch attitude with throttle setting, and conducted an emergency landing in a field adjacent to the airport, sustaining substantial damage. Postcrash examination revealed a disconnect in the pitch controls at the aft pitch control rod-end-to-bellcrank connection in the tailcone. Examination of the components revealed that the pitch control rod-end eye was missed when the connecting bolt was pushed through  the bellcrank side plate holes. When the nut was fitted to the bolt and tightened, the result was a connection that was only  a ""squeezed"", friction fit.  About 12 flight hours before the accident, on October 24, 2000, the aircraft underwent a 100-hour inspection, at which time the following was entered in the logbook, ""Checked all control push rods and rod end bearings. Lubricated Flight Controls"".  On April 24, 1980, Mooney Aircraft Corporation recognized a potential for a misconnection between the rod end and the bellcrank and promulgated Service Instruction M20-44, which had not been accomplished on this aircraft.","	The failure of maintenance personnel to properly reconnect the aircraft's elevator control system, resulting in an in-flight disconnection of the elevator control and jamming of the rudder control during climb,  the subsequent in-flight loss of control, and terrain collision following an emergency descent and landing."

The flight departed with approximately 20 gallons of fuel in each fuel tank and offloaded skydivers at 10,500 feet, then descended to return with the throttle at idle, the fuel/air ratio leaned; and carburetor heat applied.  At 2,000 feet, the pilot began to level off and, ""realized I was having engine trouble and began my emergency procedures for an engine failure at altitude....""  He checked the position of the fuel selector valve which was in the same position it was selected for takeoff, ""both on.""  He positioned the fuel selector to the left, right, and both positions with negative results, and also checked ""my ignition and check all fuses.""  He was unable to start the engine and performed a forced landing in a field.  Before touchdown he turned off the fuel selector valve; after touchdown, the airplane nosed over.  The fuel strainer was empty when examined by a mechanic approximately 45 minutes after the accident.  Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector approximately 24 hours after the accident revealed the flexible hose from the fuel strainer to the carburetor contained a slight amount of fuel (capful).  No discrepancies with the fuel strainer, ignition, or vent systems noted.  Following release by the FAA for recovery, the carburetor was removed and no fuel spray noted from the accelerator pump discharge nozzle when the throttle was activated.   The fuel flow rate through the fuel selector valve was less with the fuel selector valve positioned to the right tank than with the valve positioned to the left or both positions.  Disassembly of the fuel selector valve revealed no evidence of debris or wear; no determination was made as to the reason for the low fuel flow rate with the fuel selector positioned to the ""right"" position.  Historical uneven fuel consumption greater from the left tank was noted while operating the airplane in skydiving operations that involve mainly climbs and descents.  After repairs, the engine was placed on the airframe and operated with no discrepancies noted.

The pilot initiated an ILS approach during a period of light snow, and a ceiling of 400 feet.  During the approach, a band of heavy snow, with reduced visibility, moved over the airport.  The pilot reported established on the approach, then acknowledged a frequency change to the airport's common traffic advisory frequency.  No further transmissions were received.  Radar data revealed that the airplane joined the localizer outside the initial approach fix, and proceeded inbound, on course.  Due to limited radar coverage, the last radar contact with the airplane was about 3/4 of a mile inside the final approach fix, still on course, about 1,850 feet above the airport.  A witness, about 1/3 to 1/2 mile to the east of the airport, saw the airplane fly overhead at a very low altitude, then heard the engines rev up, and saw the airplane climb.  The airplane disappeared into the falling snow, and the witness then heard the sound of a crash.  Airplane wreckage was later found on rising terrain, about 1/2 nautical mile to the left of the runway's departure end.  The landing gear and flaps were up, and the elevator was trimmed for a climb.  Trees were initially cut at an ascending angle of about 5 degrees for approximately 50 feet, then a descending angle of about 5 degrees for another 250 feet.

During an instructional flight in rain showers, the airship became uncontrollable due to an out-of-balance (trim/pressure) envelope condition and collided with the ground and multiple obstacles during a landing attempt. While inbound to the airport for landing in high winds and moderate rain, the crew decided they could not do a “normal ‘weight-off’” to determine the weight and trim because they were heavy with rain, had no ballast to drop, and could only estimate their trim by visually checking the ballonet volume. The certified flight instructor (CFI) then got out of his seat to read the ballonet numbers and found that they had “6-7 in the rear and the front was flat.” The crew then adjusted the levels by dumping from the front ballonet and pumping air into the aft ballonet and then noted that they were even around “3 ½ each.” The CFI then suggested that they leave the aft pump on and lock off the front valves to hold the trim condition. While setting up for the approach, the nose dropped. The CFI attributed this to gusty weather conditions that prevailed at the time. He simultaneously noted that the hull pressure indicator (HPI) was low and switched the fan blower to the ON position to add air to the front ballonet. He indicated that the rear ballonet was in the AUTO position. The nose recovered and then dropped again. The CFI again noted that the HPI reading was low. He recovered using the same procedure as before, and the nose dropped a third time. The CFI checked the air pressure system and saw that the rear ballonet valve was open but stated that the indicator light on the annunciator panel indicated that the valve should have been closed. (Subsequent investigation determined that the annunciator light was wired through a valve position sensor switch and that the air valves and annunciator lights functioned properly in the open and closed positions.) Both pilots visually confirmed that a least one of the aft valves was open and would not respond to air valve control inputs. The CFI attempted to manually close the valve, with no response. Observations of the ground crew confirmed that the aft ballonet valves were open. On the first attempt to land, the airship was too high and came in too fast. The CFI aborted the landing then set up for a second approach. Due to the nose-low condition, he added more power and placed the joystick (flight control system) to the full aft position to raise the nose. The CFI stated that he needed full aft on the joystick to keep the nose up, and any movement forward resulted in an immediate drop of the nose. He concluded that the flight controls were malfunctioning, but because of low altitude, high airspeed, deteriorating weather, and the need to get the airship on the ground, he did not have time to accomplish a complete emergency procedure for a flight control malfunction. The airship landed very hard at a fast forward airspeed and with a very heavy nose. The landing gear collapsed and the gondola dug into the ground. The airship then skidded across an adjacent taxiway and struck a parked airplane. Both pilots jumped out on opposite sides of the gondola and pulled the emergency envelope deflation ripcords, but the deflation panels did not open because of the advertising banner that was attached to the airship. The airship took off, unmanned, and reached a peak altitude of 1,600 feet above ground level. The airship traveled about 4 miles northeast and struck a marina where the envelope draped over sailboats and a restaurant. 

The investigation reviewed the Federal Aviation Administration-approved flight manual. In the emergency procedures section, under “pressure-related emergencies,” the manual stated that, with a high pressure indication, the pilot should check that the helium release valves and air valves are in the UNLOCKED position. The flight manual did not address added weight to the airship caused by environmental conditions (rain). With the aft ballonet valves in the OPEN position and the fan for the forward ballonet in the ON position, the forward ballonet became fully inflated, which caused the out-of-trim/unequal hull pressure condition. A review of the airship design certification indicated that it did not address the aerodynamic effects of advertising banners being draped over the rapid envelope deflation emergency ripcords or the effects of rain on the airship. The emergency ripcord deflation system was never tested on the airship in various environmental conditions, only on a mock-up in a hangar. Because of structural damage sustained in the impact sequence, the airship’s systems could not be tested as installed on the airship. However, each individual system was functionally tested, and no anomalies were found. There was no minimum equipment list for the airship. If a component was inoperative, the airship was considered to be in an unairworthy condition. The dual ballonet level cockpit indicator had been taped over and marked “In-Op” before the flight.","One or both of the rear ballonet air relief valves remained in an open position for undetermined reasons, which caused an out-of-balance trim condition; also causal was the flight crew’s decision to the fly the airship with a known deficiency (the inoperative ballonet indicator) and the pilot’s failure to follow proper emergency procedures."

The flight was in cruise, in icing conditions, when both engines experienced momentary power fluctuations (PF) as a result of ice ingestion.  Evaluation of the flight data recorder information revealed that the left engine experienced four Type II (compressor stall) PF events, and the right engine experienced one Type I (partial/full quenching of the engine's combustor flame) PF event and one Type II event.  The flight descended, the power fluctuations ceased, and the flight proceeded to land at its intended destination.  The Saab 340 fleet has undergone extensive research, with regards to power fluctuations, since it was certified in the U.S. in 1985.  In 1985, it was determined that ice accumulates on the engine inlet splitter lip, breaks off, and enters the engine resulting in a flame-out.   An auto-ignition system was developed to provide a means to re-light the engine.  Aircraft certification rules require that no accumulation of engine inlet ice occur that will adversely affect engine operation.  In 2000, the FAA's position was that even though no re-design of the engine inlet was found that would preclude ice accumulation on the splitter lip, the risk associated with a PF event was acceptable.  Furthermore, the FAA determined that the risk of a dual engine power loss due to the existence of an icing condition and failure of both engines' auto-ignition systems was acceptably low.  Lastly, the FAA stated that inappropriate crew response risks associated with PFs combined with an in-flight shut down were quantitatively indeterminate, but deemed qualitatively acceptable by FAA certification pilots and human factors specialists.","the ingestion of ice/slush into both engines, which resulted in dual engine power fluctuations."

The instructor (pilot-in-command) and student (aircraft owner) checked the Grumman AA-1B's fuel supply believing they had about 1/4 tank (left) and 3/4 tank (right) prior to departing on the instructional flight.  Airwork at high altitude was completed, and then the aircraft was taken into the pattern for practice touch and go landings.  During the initial climb following the first touch and go, and not more than 200 feet above ground, the engine abruptly stopped and the propeller was reported to stop rotating.  The instructor took control of the aircraft, maneuvering away from trees and towards a landing site, while the student selected the right fuel tank and turned on the fuel boost pump, but did not engage the starter.  The aircraft impacted trees during the forced landing.  Fuel and aircraft log records indicated that under the best conditions (assumption of full tanks, i.e. 22 gallons useable fuel total on 09/29/00) the aircraft had a total 35.6 gallons of usable fuel expended over a duration of 7.4 Hobbs hours from 09/29/00, to the time of the accident (approximately 4.81gallons/hour average burn).  The fuel selector was reported on the left fuel tank at the time of the power loss and found on the right fuel tank at the accident site.

The flight was cleared for an ILS approach and as the airplane was approaching the point of glideslope intercept, both engines lost power.  The airplane was vectored toward a nearby airport; however, after exiting the clouds, the pilot realized that the flight could not make the airport.  The pilot initiated a forced landing to a field, and during the landing roll, the airplane crossed a road, and the right wing struck a tree.  Subsequently, the nose landing gear separated when it struck a dirt berm.  The airplane came to a stop upright.  Examination of the fuel system revealed the aft main tank was 1/3-1/2 full of fuel, and the forward main tank 90% full of fuel.  Examination of the cockpit revealed that the fuel selector for the main tanks was found in the NORMAL position.  With the selector in the NORMAL position, the aft main tank supplies fuel to the left engine, and the forward main tank supplies fuel to the right engine.  Examination of the fuel system revealed no discrepancies.  The fuel boost pumps were activated and fuel flowed from the fuel supply lines.  The left and right airframe fuel filters and the left and right engine fuel filters contained fuel.  Examination of both engines revealed no anomalies that would have precluded the operation of the engines.  The pilot reported that at the time of the dual engine failure, the fuel selector was selecting the aft tank, thereby feeding both engines from the aft fuel tank.

When he added engine throttle to level the airplane at 500 feet, the engine began sputtering.  He then applied carburetor heat, but the engine did not respond.  The engine continued to run rough, and the airplane could not sustain level flight.  The pilot selected a snow-covered gravel bar for a forced landing.  The airplane touched down in snow that was about 18 inches deep.  During the landing roll, the airplane nosed over, and received damage to the right wing lift strut and the rudder.  The pilot reported the weather conditions in the area of the accident as 1,200 to 1,500 feet overcast; temperature 35 to 38 degrees F; light to moderate snow showers.  According to published carburetor icing charts, the atmospheric conditions at the time of the accident (38 degrees and visible moisture) reflected the probability of serious icing utilizing descent power.  A postaccident inspection disclosed no mechanical anomalies with the engine.","The pilot's improper use of the carburetor heat control.  Factors in the accident were the presence of carburetor icing conditions, and snow-covered terrain that was unsuitable for a forced landing."

During an instructional flight, the pilot handling the flight controls ground looped his airplane while landing on runway 31.  Prior to the accident, the pilot had successfully performed a series of takeoffs and 3-point landings under the supervision of his flight instructor.  However, a wind gust was encountered during the pilot's last landing.  The pilot indicated that he was unable to maintain directional control, the airplane veered left, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the right wing contacted the runway surface and broke.  The flight instructor indicated that, at the time, the wind was from the southwest at 10 knots, with 15-knot gusts.  The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate and had about 5,000 hours of flight time, but only about 2 hours in his recently purchased tail wheel equipped airplane.  The flight instructor, whom the pilot hired to check him out, had 3,469.7 hours of flight time.  However, his flying experience in the accident airplane was 5 hours.  Runway 31 is 11,802 feet long and 300 feet wide.","The student's failure to maintain directional control while landing in a crosswind, his improper compensation for wind conditions, and the flight instructor's inadequate flight supervision."

Witnesses heard the engines sputtering as the airplane started its takeoff roll and accelerated on the runway.  The flight reached an altitude of about 200 to 300 feet above ground level, when the right engine lost power.  The pilot could not maintain altitude, he feathered the right engine, turned the airplane right about 100 degrees, and attempted a forced landing in a pasture.  The landing gear was down and locked, the airplane stalled, and impacted the ground right wing and nose low.  The investigation revealed sufficient fuel.  Engine test runs revealed that both engines ran without discrepancies except for some intermittent roughness and missing during the right engine run.  Examination of the right magneto revealed frayed and broken insulation on the ""P"" lead.  Internal examination of left magneto revealed that the advance spark system wire was chaffed through and making some contact with the normal points circuit at the normal point condenser connection.  It was determined by those present at the right engine run, that under running conditions, a possible grounding short of the normal points operation could have occurred at this location.  At the time of the accident the pilot reported that he had a total flight time in all aircraft of about 2,960 hours.  In addition, he reported 96 total hours in muti-engine aircraft, and 41 hours in this make and model.","a loss of right engine power due to chaffed and frayed wiring on the right and left magnetos on the right engine resulting in a forced landing, an inadvertent stall, and subsequent impact with the ground."

According to witnesses, the airplane collided with two deer shortly after touchdown.  Following the collision, the airplane continued down the runway with the tires smoking, veered off the right side of the runway near the end, crossed a taxiway, impacted into a ditch and burst into flames. After the accident, the captain and first officer both reported that the thrust reversers failed to operate after they were deployed during the landing.

Examination of the landing gear found all three gear collapsed. The right and left main tires had areas of rubber that were worn completely through. The flaps were found extended, and both thrust reversers were found in the stowed position. Examination of the cockpit found the throttles in the idle position, and the thrust reverser levers in the stowed position.  

Aircraft performance calculations indicate that the airplane traveled 1,500 feet down the runway after touchdown, in 4.2 seconds, before striking the deer.  The calculations also indicate that the airplane landed with a ground speed of 124 knots. At 124 knots and maximum braking applied, the airplane should have come to a complete stop in about 850 feet.  However, investigation of the accident site and surrounding area revealed heavy black skid marks beginning at the first taxiway turnoff about 1,500 feet down the 5,010 foot runway.  The skid marks continued for about 2,500 feet, departed the right side of the runway and proceeded an additional 500 feet over grass and dirt. 



The investigation revealed that deer fur was found lodged in the squat switch on the left main landing gear, likely rendering the squat switch inoperative after the impact with the deer, and prior to the airplane’s loss of control on the runway. Since a valid signal from the squat switch is required for thrust reverser deployment, the loss of this signal forced the thrust reversers to stow.  At this point, the electronic engine control (EEC) likely switched to the forward thrust schedule and  engine power increased to near takeoff power, which led to the airplane to continue down the runway, and off of it.

Following the accident, the manufacturer issued an Airplane Flight Manual revision that changed the name of the “Inadvertent Stow of Thrust Reverser During Landing Rollout” abnormal procedure to “Inadvertent Stow of Thrust Reverser After a Crew-Commanded Deployment” and moved it into the emergency procedures section.

The pilot and eight parachutists were returning from a skydive meet. The pilot had obtained a weather briefing, which advised of instrument meteorological conditions at the destination, and filed a VFR flight plan, but it was never activated. Witnesses heard, but could not see, a twin engine turboprop pass over the airport, heading north out over the Great Salt Lake. They described the weather conditions as being a low ceiling with 1/4-mile visibility, light snow, haze, and fog. They said it was almost dark. The airplane impacted the water approximately 1/2-mile off shore. It had been stripped of all avionics except for one transceiver and a hand-held GPS receiver. One member of the skydive club, who had flown with the pilot, said he had previously encountered poor weather conditions and descended over the Great Salt Lake until he could see the ground, then proceeded to the airport. Another member related a similar experience, but said they descended over the Great Salt Lake in the vicinity of the accident site. The pilot was able to navigate in deteriorating weather conditions to Tooele Airport, using various landmarks. Examination of the airframe, engines, and propellers did not reveal evidence of any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.","the pilot's exercise of poor judgment and his failure to maintain a safe altitude/clearance above the water. Contributing factors were the weather conditions that included low ceiling and visibility obscured by snow and mist, an inadequately equipped airplane for flying in instrument meteorological conditions, and the pilot's overconfidence in his personal ability in that he had reportedly done this on two previous occasions."

According to the instrument rated commercial pilot, he flew under the hood for a flight in simulated instrument conditions, during dark night light conditions.  His passenger, who held a private pilot certificate and was not instrument rated, was the designated safety pilot.  When the flight neared the destination airport, the pilot remained flying under the hood and began to execute a GPS instrument approach.  He reported that he passed over the initial approach fix, at 4,000 feet and initiated a 500 fpm descent at 140 knots.  He added that the flight crossed the final approach fix, at 2,600 feet, and he then extended the flaps and lowered the landing gear.  Approximately 15 seconds had elapsed when the airplane contacted trees and impacted the ground.  The passenger reported that as the airplane crossed the final approach fix he had the runway in sight.  However, he then lost sight of the runway and was about to tell the pilot to ""pull up,"" when the impact occurred.  The airplane collided with trees at an elevation of 1,199 feet approximately 1.21 miles past the final approach fix and 2.79 miles prior to reaching the missed approach point.  Radar data revealed that the aircraft's altitude was 3,500 feet over the initial approach fix, and 2,200 feet approximately 1.02 nautical miles prior to reaching the final approach fix.  According to the GPS instrument approach plate, the minimum altitude at the final approach fix, was 2,600 feet and the minimum descent altitude for a straight in approach was 1,660 feet.","the pilot's failure to maintain proper glide path during a practice instrument approach, which resulted in an in-flight collision with terrain.

The pilot departed on an estimated 1-hour positioning flight with an unknown quantity of fuel.  He did not visually verify the quantity in the tanks, and he estimated that the quantity indicated on the fuel gauge would be sufficient for 1 hour 30 minutes of flight.  About 20 minutes after departure, the pilot determined his fuel supply had diminished into his 'reserve' and he landed at an airport for fuel.  The pilot taxied to the pump but an airport employee communicated through hand signals that fuel was unavailable for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes, and without stopping the engine, the pilot elected to continue the flight.  About 55 minutes after the initial takeoff, the engine stopped running, and the pilot performed a forced landing to wooded terrain.  Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of fuel spillage and no odor of fuel at the scene.  About 1 gallon of residual fuel was recovered from the airplane's fuel system.  When asked if fuel was available prior to his original departure, the pilot said: ""Yeah, there was.  I taxied right by it.""",the loss of engine power due to the pilot's inadequate preflight planning and exhaustion of his fuel supply.

The airplane landed hard, bounced back into the air, and on the second landing departed the runway and struck desert brush.  There were two CFI's on board the airplane.  The purpose of the flight was to provide transition training culminating in a flight check for the pilot so he would be able to instruct the owner of the airplane.  No problems were noted with the pilot's landings by the CFI, except they were a little bumpy.  On the accident landing the airplane touched down hard.  After the first bounce the pilot added power to straighten out and regain control of the airplane.  When the airplane touched down the second time it departed the runway to the left coming to rest in desert brush.  There were no problems noted with the airplane by either pilot.

The flight proceeded VFR, without a flight plan, until a location about 40 miles southwest of the destination airport.  Due to weather at the destination, the pilot filed and was given an IFR clearance.  He was cleared to descend to 3,000 feet, proceed to the initial approach fix for the ILS runway 20 approach, and subsequently cleared for the approach, via the published procedure turn.  The minimum altitude for the procedure turn was 1,600 feet.  According to the controller's statement, he requested an altitude report from the pilot, and had to advise him his ""assigned altitude was 3,000…..he was at various altitudes from 2,000 to 2,700.""  The last radar plot at 1823:47, showed the flight was at 2,100 feet, still in the procedure turn, when radar and radio communications were lost.  The airplane struck wires about 35 feet above the ground, about 11.5 miles north of the airport.  The pilot had accumulated a total of 4,015 total flight hours, all in single engine aircraft, and 137 hours in this make and model aircraft.  In addition, the logbooks showed that he had 324 total night flight hours, 135 simulated instrument flight hours, and 105 actual instrument flight hours.  The pilot had logged a total of 10.6 instrument flight hours for the entire years of 1999 and 2000.  July 12, 2000, was the last entry that showed .4  of an hour instrument flight time.  Examination of the engine, propeller, and the vacuum pump revealed no discrepancies.  The accident occurred during the hours of darkness, and the reported weather at about the time of the accident was; 300 overcast, visibility 1 sm light rain, winds calm, temperature 55 degrees F, dew point 54 degrees F, and the altimeter was 30.19 inches Hg.  Toxicological tests revealed that Chlorpheniramine was found in the urine and blood at levels consistent with a normal single dose of the medication within approximately the previous 24 hours.  Chlorpheniramine use can result in drowsiness, and has measurable effects on performance of complex cognitive and motor tasks (e.g. flying an aircraft). It may also interfere with the normal function of the inner ear, potentially increasing susceptibility to spatial disorientation.","the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane due to spatial disorientation, which resulted in an in-flight collision with power lines and the subsequent impact with terrain.

According to the pilot's wife, the pilot woke up early on the day of the accident, and flew to Lawrence, Massachusetts, to look at an airplane he was considering purchasing.  She talked with the pilot about 1000.  The pilot stated he had landed at Norwood, Massachusetts, due to snow and the poor weather conditions and that he had hoped to complete the flight before the weather moved into the area.  At that time, the pilot stated he had called for a rental car and was waiting for it to arrive, so he could drive home.  She next talked to the pilot about 1430, and was informed that he was still waiting for a rental car to arrive.  She stated that the pilot was ""very frustrated;"" and they talked about him possibly renting a room at a local hotel.  The pilot stated he would call her when the rental car arrived.  At approximately 1612, the pilot requested a ""special visual flight rules"" (SVFR) clearance to depart the airport to the southwest.  The controller noted that the ceiling was 400 feet overcast, and observed, "" what appeared to be up to 2 inches of slush and snow on the airplane's wings and control surfaces.""

On a coupled instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 16R at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, the aircraft deviated approximately 0.4 nautical mile east of the final approach course.  During missed approach, the aircraft flew east of parallel runway 16L and in proximity to an approximately 290-foot-high air traffic control (ATC) tower under construction on the airport.  The crew subsequently made a second approach and landing attempt without further incident.  The flight crew reported that the incident approach was flown with the autopilot coupled to the #1 NAV, and that all instruments indicated on course and on glide slope during final approach. The crew reported that at decision height, they initiated a missed approach when they did not observe the proper visual cues, and that the tower subsequently informed them that they were left of course.  On the second (successful) approach attempt, the first officer hand-flew the approach using the #2 NAV.  Visibility at the time was reported as 1/4 statute mile with freezing fog, with a vertical visibility of 100 feet.  A post-incident flight inspection of the localizer and glide slope did not disclose any problems with the ILS signal.  During post-incident troubleshooting of the aircraft's course deviation circuitry, maintenance personnel discovered a defective relay in the switching matrix for the aircraft's flight management system (FMS), which was installed under an FAA Supplemental Type Certificate.  Whenever the area around the FMS switching matrix or the defective relay itself was physically tapped, the captain's course deviation indicator (CDI) was observed to jump.  When a replacement relay was installed, this anomaly was not observed.  Inflight system testing also disclosed that the autopilot was erratic in pitch, with porpoising about the glide slope.  Maintenance personnel subsequently discovered an anomaly during the autopilot pitch computer self test, which was resolved by replacing the fore and aft pitch accelerometers.  Maintenance personnel further discovered that by replacing the BNC connectors at NAV 1 and NAV 2, significant improvements in system efficiency were attained.

When the private pilot, co-pilot and passenger arrived at the airport it began to snow heavily.  The airplane was pre-flighted, then towed out of the heated hangar and fueled.  The private pilot taxied to the end of the 5,400 foot long runway, parked, and performed an engine run-up.  After the run-up, the co-pilot reached the Elkins, West Virginia, AFSS on his cell phone, received a weather briefing, filed an IFR flight plan, and requested an IFR clearance.  Since Elkins was not the primary AFSS for the area, the briefer placed him on hold to service his request.  The call got disconnected, so he called the FSS back.  Due to the long hold time, the co-pilot then called Indianapolis Center and received an IFR clearance.  Once the clearance was obtained, the private pilot performed another engine run-up and noticed that about 3 to 4 inches of slush had accumulated on the runway, and about 1/2 to 3/4 inches of slush had accumulated along the surface of both wings.  The pilots discussed if they should return to the hangar and wipe off the wings, but agreed that the slush would ""blow-off"" during the take-off roll.   The private pilot estimated that he used about 4,500 feet of the runway before he obtained 80 knots (Vr).  He rotated the airplane, but it did not lift normally.  To avoid obstructions, the private pilot simultaneously turned the aircraft to the right, and retarded the throttle.  The airplane touched down, slid, turned, and came to rest upright facing the runway.  Examination of the airplane revealed that both wings were covered with snow, and localized areas of ice were found along the top surfaces of both wings near the trailing edge.  The air intake and pitot tube were absent of debris.  According to the airplane's pre-flight checklist, the wings and empennage surfaces should be clear of ice, snow, and frost prior to take-off.  The pilot estimated that from the time the airplane was pulled from the hangar to the time of the accident was about 1-hour.  The pilot also reported that there were no mechanical deficiencies.","pilot's improper pre-flight planning and failure to follow the published checklist procedures, which resulted in ice and snow not being removed from the wings prior to take-off."

The flight crew planned and briefed for an autoland to runway 4R, with winds from 340 degrees at 17 knots, and gusts to 23 knots.  The runway had been plowed, and was covered with thin wet snow.  On final approach to runway 4R, the control tower gave the pilots winds from 340 degrees at 15 knots, and braking action poor.  About 1 second after nose wheel touchdown, the airplane deviated left and the auto-pilot system corrected back.  About 11 seconds after touchdown, the airplane deviated left again, did not correct back, and the pilot disconnected the autopilot to regain directional control.  He was unable to restore runway heading, and kept the airplane straight as it departed the runway on the left side.  The MU readings given to the flight crew, and on the ATIS, of .28, .28, and .26 were 5 hours old.  A more recent MU reading of .21, .23, and .24, was 3 hours old, and had not been placed on the ATIS.  The control tower did not have a tracking procedure in place for adding revised MU readings to the ATIS, nor was it required.  However, airport operations personnel reported they had transmitted the revised readings to the control tower.  The airplane FCOM stated, ""...automatic roll out performance has been approved on dry and wet runway, but performance has not been demonstrated on snow covered or icy runway.""

Prior to the day of the accident, the pilot had not flown the make and model accident airplane.  He ""topped off"" the 24-gallon fuel tank with 21.5 gallons of fuel.  The pilot then performed two takeoffs and landings to familiarize himself with the airplane.  The familiarization flight lasted about 20 minutes, and then the pilot let the engine idle on the ground for approximately 20 minutes, before he departed about 1400 on a cross country flight.  ""About"" 1630, a witness observed a blue and white airplane circling a lake about 200-300 feet above the ground.  The witness heard the engine noise cease, return, and cease again.  The airplane then disappeared from sight, and the wreckage was located 5 days later.  It was about 1.5 miles from the lake, and 100 miles east of the destination airport.  During examination of the wreckage, an FAA inspector did not find any fuel in the tanks or carburetor.  He did find about 1/4 ounce of fuel in the fuel bowl.  The inspector also found a piece of paper in the wreckage that revealed the pilot planned the flight to be 2 hours and 30 minutes, at 150 knots.  However, the previous owner and a witness stated the airplane cruised about 110-120 knots.  According to the engine manufacturer, the engine consumed about 7.2 gallons of fuel per hour at 75% cruise performance.  Review of the data revealed that at performance cruise, for 3 hours and 15 minutes, the engine would consume approximately 23.4 gallons of fuel.  Although the autopsy report indicated that the pilot died from the rupture of a pre-existing abdominal aortic aneurysm, evidence observed by rescue personnel suggested that the pilot initially survived the impact and attempted to activate the ELT and egress the airplane.  Inspection of the ELT and maintenance records revealed that the batteries had been removed 6 days prior to the accident flight, and the entry ""ELT removed for repairs this date"" was made in the airframe logbook.","The pilot's improper preflight planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion.

A Douglas DC-3 airplane departed an island runway during dark night, VFR conditions without filing a flight plan.  The airplane collided with a volcanic mountain at 1,500 feet msl on the runway heading, 4.5 miles from the airport.  Earlier in the day, the airplane arrived from Anchorage, Alaska, without a flight plan, having flown along the Alaska Peninsula when VFR flight was not recommended. The crew of the airplane initially planned to remain overnight on the peninsula, but the captain received a request to transport cargo to Anchorage.  The airplane was loaded with cargo and fuel, and departed.  The crew did not file a flight plan.  The end of the departure runway is positioned at the edge of an ocean bay.  Beyond the end of the runway, open water and rising volcanic island terrain are present.  In the area of intended flight, no illumination of the terrain, or any ground based lighting was present.  An obstacle departure procedure for the departure runway recommends a right turn at 2 DME from the runway heading, and then a climb to 7,000 feet.  Forty-five minutes after departure, a fire was spotted on the side of a volcano cone, and an ELT signal was detected in the area.  No company flight following procedures were found for the accident flight, and the airplane was not reported overdue until the following day.  The day after the accident, the airplane wreckage was located on steep, snow-covered terrain.  Due to high winds and blowing snow, a rescue team could not get to the accident site until three days after the crash.  The captain was the president, the director of operations, and the sole corporate entity of the company.  No current maintenance records, flight logs, or pilot logs were located for the company.  In the past, the captain's pilot certificate was suspended for 45 days following an accident in a DC-3 airplane when he ran out of gas.  Also, the captain's medical certificate had previously been considered for denial after serving 49 months in federal prison for cocaine distribution, but after review, the FAA issued the captain a first class medical.  FAA medical records for the captain do not contain any record of monitoring for substance abuse.  The first officer's medical had also been considered for denial after an episode of a loss of consciousness.  After a lengthy review and an appeal to the NTSB, the FAA issued the first officer a second-class medical.  The first officer was part of the flight crew when the captain ran out of gas, and she had two previous aviation accidents.  A toxicological examination of the captain, conducted by the FAA, found cocaine and metabolites of cocaine.  A toxicological examination of the first officer found two different prescription antidepressant drugs.  The FAA prohibits narcotic and mood-altering drug use by pilots.","The airplane flightcrew's failure to maintain adequate distance/altitude from mountainous terrain during a departure climb to cruise flight, and the captain's impairment from drugs.  Factors in the accident were dark night conditions, and the first officer's impairment from drugs."

The private certificated pilot/owner was landing at a remote airport.  The purpose of the flight was to work on the FAA's VOR building at the destination airport.  The pilot is an employee of the FAA's  Airways Facilities Branch.  The pilot said that his check of weather conditions included a wind report of 060 degrees at eight knots.  Upon arrival over the airport, the pilot said he visually checked the wind sock at the airport.  The wind sock frame appeared to be oriented about 150 degrees, but the tail of the sock was blowing at an angle.  The wind appeared to be 060 degrees at 10 knots, with gusts to 15 knots.  The pilot landed on runway 33, touching down at the approach end of the runway.  The runway surface was icy, and about 300 feet after touchdown, the airplane was blown to the left.  The pilot was unable to correct the left drift, and the airplane departed the left side of the runway, into an area of soft snow.  The airplane nosed over, and received damage to the wings and vertical stabilizer.  The remarks section of the airport facility directory/Alaska supplement notes that the airport is unattended, the runway condition is not monitored, the airport has frequent crosswinds, and the windsock at the south end of the airport is damaged, and not functioning properly.","The pilot's inadequate compensation for a crosswind during the landing roll.  Factors in the accident were the presence of a crosswind, an icy runway and snow covered terrain, the pilot's inadequate preflight planning/preparation, and an inaccurate wind direction indicator."

The single engine helicopter experienced a loss of engine power after the oil was inadvertently pumped overboard.  A company mechanic replaced the torque gauge prior to the accident flight due to needle ""bounce.""  The mechanic bled the torque system and reinstalled a radio that was removed to facilitate the work.  During the radio installation, he inadvertently engaged the bleed valve, which is located behind the instrument panel, allowing oil to flow out of the engine from behind the instrument panel.  While at 9,500 feet, the engine lost power and the pilot performed an autorotation landing to a field at the base of mountains.  The pilot said he touched down smooth and light; however, the main rotor blades flexed and severed the tail boom.  As a result of the accident, the operator rerouted the torque system bleed line toward the pilot's feet so that they could detect an inadvertent oil leak.","The mechanic's inadvertent activation of the bleed valve, which resulted in a loss of engine oil and loss of engine power while in cruise flight."

Shortly after takeoff at less than 200 feet above ground level the pilot reported an engine failure, and requested to return to the airport. The controller saw the airplane in a right turn, descending, and observed the airplane level its wings just prior to impact with the tips of trees. The airplane collided with terrain approximately 2,000 feet east of the approach end of runway 20L. A post crash fire ensued and consumed a majority of the airplane. Examination of both engines displayed contact signatures to their internal components characteristic of the engines being powered, with the propellers out of feather at the time of impact, and a low power range. Examination of the propellers found the left propeller blades showed more damage then the blades from the right propeller. Both propellers were rotating with considerable rotational energy. However, examination showed that the left propeller had more power then the right.","The pilot's failure to follow loss of engine power emergency procedures by not feathering the propeller following the loss of engine power for undetermined reasons, resulting in a descent and collision with trees and the ground."

The pilot departed from runway 26 in the military jet trainer and made an immediate steep left hand turn at an estimated 100 to 300 feet above the ground.  Approximately 30 seconds later, the back seat canopy transparency failed and separated from the aircraft.  The back seat passenger's headset and hat accompanied the transparency fragments to the ground.  The airplane began oscillating divergently, pitching up to near vertical, turned right, and impacted the ground longitudinally oriented approximately 60 degrees to the right of the energy track alignment.  The airplane's most recent empty weight CG calculations indicate that the airplane was at 34.98% MAC; the factory recommends a 27.7% MAC empty weight CG.  The airplane's flight CG (with two occupants and the main fuel tank full) was calculated to be 29.58% MAC.  The manufacturer recommends an approximate flight CG of 23 to 25.5% MAC.  As the CG moves aft of this envelope, aircraft control becomes progressively more sensitive.  The manufacturer reported that their test pilot's have flown the airplane with CGs as high 34% to 35% MAC, and aircraft records indicate that the pilot had previous flight experience with CGs in the 29% to 30% MAC range.  Aircraft records also indicate that the pilot had 38.6 hours of flight experience in the airplane in approximately 3 years, and 6.6 hours of experience during the last 18 months.  The night before the accident, the pilot had returned from a trip around the world in his Boeing Business Jet, with multiple business stops along the way.  Analysis of the rear canopy's transparency indicated that it was embrittled.","The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control, and the subsequent inadvertent stall/mush.  Factors were the pilot's diverted attention due to the failure of the rear canopy's acrylic transparency and the loss of communication with his back seat passenger, the pilot's lack of recent experience in make/model airplane, the airplane's improper aft weight distribution (center of gravity), and the pilot's fatigue (circadian rhythm)."

According to radar data, at 1729:09, the airplane departed on a night cross-country flight and its transponder was sending a 1200 (VFR) code.  There were no records found of the flight contacting air traffic control, nor was it required to do so.  The airplane climbed to 9,200 feet and flew toward the destination airport.  At 1756:53, the airplane initiated a 250 foot per minute rate of descent.  At 1800:55, the final radar image was received 11 miles north of the destination airport, at 8,200 feet msl (500 feet agl).  Prior to the last radar return, the airplane had been in a steady, gradual descent.  The accident site was located approximately 8 miles north-northeast of the destination airport.  A witness, who lives near the accident site, reported that at the time of the accident dense fog conditions were occurring and the visibility was less than 50 yards.  Review of weather observations revealed that the flight departed in visual meteorological conditions and the weather conditions deteriorated to instrument meteorological conditions as the flight progressed toward the destination airport.  During the one hour time period surrounding the accident, the weather at the nearest observation facility to the accident site changed from a few clouds at 300 feet, scattered clouds at 1,300 feet, visibility 3 miles in fog, and a 1 degree temperature dew point spread, to broken clouds at 200 feet and a 0 degree temperature dew point spread.  No record of the pilot receiving a pre-flight weather briefing from a flight service station was found.  The airframe and engine were examined and no pre-impact anomalies were found that would have precluded their operation.","the pilot's continued visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), which resulted in an in-flight collision with terrain.  Contributing factors to the accident were the low clouds, reduced visibilities due to fog, and the dark night light condition."

The Captain reported they were flying a visual approach following the localizer to intercept the glideslope.  When flaps 45 were selected, the airplane rolled right about 15 to 20 degrees.  Application of left aileron and rudder controlled the roll, and the approach was aborted.  After consulting maintenance and flight operations and conducting a visual inspection, the Captain determined they had a failure of the right flight spoiler.  A decision was made to land using corrected speeds per the checklist.  The approach and landing were uneventful.  A post-flight inspection revealed the right flight spoiler was fully deployed and the right spoiler lug had fractured and separated from the hydraulic actuator.  A review of the maintenance records indicated the right flight spoiler had acquired a total of 3,987.9 cycles and 4,064 landings.  Metallurgical examination revealed the aluminum spoiler lug had failed due to fatigue.  Transport Canada issued an Airworthiness Directive on February 22, 2001, that required the inspection of aluminum flight spoiler lugs at 3,000 cycles, and at intervals not to exceed 500 cycles.  The AD also stipulated that the installation of redesigned flight spoilers which utilized steel lugs provided terminating action to the inspection requirements.  The FAA issued an AD on July 26, 2001, that required the same inspection criteria as the Transport Canada AD.",The uncommanded deployment of the right flight spoiler due to the fatigue fracture of the spoiler lug.

Approximately five minutes into the cross-county instructional flight, a drop in engine RPM occurred.  After a continued steady decrease in the engine RPM, the engine lost total power.  Attempts to restart the engine were unsuccessful.  During the ensuing forced landing to a field, the nose wheel contacted soft ground, and the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted.  At the time of the accident, the airplane had accumulated 2 hours total time since its last annual inspection.  During that annual inspection, the carburetor was removed for additional maintenance.  Examination indicated that when the throttle control was actuated from inside the cockpit, the throttle cable and lever did not actuate the throttle shaft and throttle valve.  The castellated lock nut securing the throttle lever to the throttle shaft on the carburetor was found not to be saftied, via a required cotter pin.  The lock nut had loosened, allowing the throttle cable and lever to move, without movement of  the throttle shaft and throttle valve.",maintenance personnel's improper installation of the throttle lever lock nut.  A contributory factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

The pilot arrived at the airport, and serviced the airplane with 10 gallons of fuel.  He started the engine,  checked all the gauges, found no anomalies, and departed.  During the flight, the pilot preformed several touch-and-goes at several different airports before proceeding to his planned destination.  At his destination, the pilot maneuvered the airplane to land.  Once on final, the pilot selected approach flaps, but they did not extend.  With the throttle completely retarded, the pilot started executing ""S"" turns to maintain a proper descent rate.  On short final, the pilot noticed that the airplane was right of the runway so he turned left, and then started a flare to land.  The airplane touched down and went off the runway to the left.  It then hit a hangar and parked airplane about 500 feet from the approach end of the runway before coming to an stop.  Continuity of the flaps system could not be verified because of impact damage.",The pilot's failure to maintain runway alignment during the landing roll.

The pilot departed Olympia in the Cessna 182R en route to Renton, Washington.  Shortly after departure he smelled a ""faint odor of electrical insulation"" but observed no anomalies.  Upon arrival at Renton, he lowered the landing gear, and during the landing roll the main landing gear collapsed.  Post-crash examination of the aircraft revealed that the hydraulic power pack had worn gears within the pump assembly.   This condition would allow the electrically driven pump to operate for longer than normal periods of time and ultimately resulted in the pump overheating and its associated circuit breaker tripping during the flight.  Additionally, the green landing gear ""down and locked"" annunciator light's manual iris was found to be open only 1/16 of an inch.  With the iris stopped down to near total closure the pilot would have been unable to see the green light had it been illuminated.  With the electrically driven pump out of service due to the tripped circuit breaker, the gear would not have hydraulic pressure to lock into the down position and complete the circuit thus illuminating the green light, and the pilot failed to verify a down an locked condition other than placing the gear handle in the down position.","The worn condition of the hydraulic pump gears which resulted in a continuous running pump, subsequent pump motor overheat and eventually the tripping of the pump motor circuit breaker.  An additional cause was the pilot's failure to verify that the landing gear were down and locked.  A contributing factor was a partially blocked green annunciator light."

The pilot departed on a scheduled flight conducted under night instrument meteorological conditions.  Arriving in the area of the destination airport, the weather was reported as, winds from 220 degrees at 18 knots, gusts to 25 knots; 1/2 statute miles of visibility and haze; vertical visibility of 100 feet.  The pilot was vectored and cleared for the ILS 24 approach.   As the airplane crossed the glideslope, the pilot observed that the ""ride"" became increasingly bumpy and turbulent, with a strong wind component from the right.  The approach lights came into view as the airplane neared the runway, but soon disappeared due to the low visibility.  The pilot executed a missed approach, and as full power was applied, the airplane began to move laterally to the left.  During the missed approach, a ""thunk"" was heard on the left side of the fuselage, and the airplane descended into the trees.  The airplane came to rest in a wooded area about 1/4 mile from the Runway 24 threshold, about 1,000 feet to the left of the extended centerline.  Review of the approach plate for the ILS 24 approach revealed that the glide slope altitude at the final approach fix for the non-precision approach, which was located about 4 miles from the approach end of the runway, was 1,407 feet.  The glide slope altitude at the middle marker, which was located about 0.6 miles from the approach end of the runway, was 299 feet.  Review of radar data revealed that the airplane intercepted the glideslope about 4 miles from the threshold of runway 24.  In the following 2 minutes, 30 seconds, the airplane deviated below and returned to the glideslope centerline approximately 4 times, with a maximum deviation of 2-dots below the glideslope centerline.  About 1-mile from the runway, the airplane began a trend downward from the glideslope centerline, descending below the 2-dot low deviation line of the glideslope to an altitude of about 300 feet, when the last radar hit was recorded.  During the approach, the airplane's groundspeed varied between 50 and 125 knots.  According to the Aeronautical Information Manual chapter on Navigation Aids, Instrument Landing System (ILS), it stated that ""Make every effort to remain on the indicated glide path."" It also cautioned the pilot to, ""Avoid flying below the glide path to assure obstacle/terrain clearance is maintained.""",The pilot's failure to maintain a stabilized approach with an adequate vertical and lateral track.  Also causal was his failure to maintain obstacle clearance.

Microscopic examination revealed that a portion of the fatigue region had been painted over with paint that matched the exterior of the mast.  The mast installed in the accident helicopter had a narrower fillet radius than masts subsequently produced by the manufacturer.  An FAA Airworthiness Directive (AD) that required inspecting and strengthening of the fillet radius affected the narrower masts.  As a result of this investigation, the FAA amended the AD to immediately retire some transmission/mast combinations, and to ultimately remove all of the narrower masts from service.","The fatigue failure in the fillet radius of the mast, which resulted in the separation of the main rotor system."

The pilot reported that, during his preflight inspection of the aircraft, he noted the fuel gauges indicated about 25 gallons total fuel in the tanks, and, while looking in each of the two tanks and rocking the aircraft, he could hear sloshing and saw an irregular reflection.  After takeoff, while climbing out at 120 - 130 knots and climbing 500 feet per minute, the airplane was near 4,000 feet msl when he felt the controls of the airplane get heavy.  He had a headset on and couldn't hear the engine well.  When he checked the instruments he saw that the engine tachometer was down to 1,200 rpm and the airspeed was slowing to below 100 knots.  There was no roughness, no loud noise, and no sputtering from the engine.  The engine continued to windmill.  The airplane was on the right-hand fuel tank and he switched to the left tank.  The throttle, propeller, and mixture controls were in the full forward position.  He believed that he only turned on the low fuel boost pump switch position because he focused his attention outside the airplane on selecting a site and landing.  The aircraft recovery company reported that, when they recovered the airplane, there was no fuel in the right tank and about 8 gallons fuel in the left tank (0.5 gallons of fuel in each tank is unusable).  A postaccident examination of the aircraft did not reveal any mechanical abnormality.  According to the Cessna Aircraft Company Pilot Operating Handbook for the model T210M (Emergency Procedures, Engine Failure During Flight), following loss of engine power, the pilot should; 1) switch to the fuller fuel tank, 2) place the mixture control in the full rich position, 3) turn the auxiliary fuel pump on for 3 - 5 seconds with the throttle 1/2 open, and 4) slowly advance the throttle.  A Cessna Aircraft spokesman said that, if the throttle and mixture were full forward (full throttle and rich mixture) and the boost pump remained on while the engine was rotating at only 1,200 rpm, a flooded fuel condition was likely created in the engine which prevented restart.","The failure of the pilot to comply with emergency procedures contained in the Pilot's Operating Handbook, which resulted in an excessively rich mixture and loss of engine power."

The student glider pilot had 25 hours total experience.  This was his second flight of the day but his first ever in a single-place  glider.  He reported the flight was normal until the point where he returned for landing and was entering the landing traffic pattern.  ""[F]or some reason unknown to me, the glider went into a spin.""  He recovered from the spin about 200 - 300 feet below normal pattern altitude.  He acknowledged that he should have adjusted his pattern to account for the loss of altitude but instead attempted to fly a normal pattern.  As the aircraft approached the turning point from base leg to final approach, ""I should have continued flying straight ahead, but I attempted to turn anyway.  I was going too slow and was much too low to make a turn.""  The glider entered a spin a second time and impacted the ground.  The pilot acknowledged having heard his instructor's instruction over the radio telling him to land straight ahead and not attempt the turn to final approach.","The failure of the glider pilot to maintain adequate airspeed during a turn from base leg to final approach, which lead to a stall and spin."

After taxiing from the far end of the field and performing his pre-takeoff run-up check, the pilot experienced problems with his VHF radio and intercom. While he was attempting to correct the problems, he allowed the engine to idle in serious carburetor icing conditions for three or four minutes. After correcting the communications equipment problems, the pilot pulled onto the runway and took off without applying the carburetor heat  to eliminate any carburetor ice that may have accumulated since the run-up check. After reaching an altitude of about 200 feet above the ground, the engine began to lose power. Because the loss of power made it impossible to maintain altitude, the pilot attempted a forced landing on a nearby golf course. Although the touchdown was successful, the main landing gear collapsed when the aircraft encountered rough/uneven terrain during the landing roll. A post accident inspection of the engine did not reveal any evidence of  anomalies or malfunctions that would have contributed to the loss of power.","the pilot's failure to apply carburetor heat prior to takeoff while operating in serious carburetor icing conditions. Factors include operating in serious carburetor icing conditions, and rough/uneven terrain in the area of the forced landing."

The pilot was transporting two search and rescue volunteers and their equipment to the scene of an avalanche in a float-equipped helicopter.  A helicopter landing zone (heli spot) had been established the evening before the accident, near the toe of the avalanche.  The heli spot had been used by a military helicopter, and was marked by small flags.  The surface of the snow at the heli spot had been dusted by red powder.  The pilot of the accident helicopter had not landed at the heli spot before.  The heli spot was located at 5,300 feet msl, near the bottom of a small valley.  The pilot began his landing approach toward the west.  Although the weather conditions were clear, the pilot said the lighting conditions in the valley provided little contrast (flat light).  The pilot said that as he began to add power near the termination of the landing approach, the low rotor warning horn sounded, and he noticed that the main rotor gauge was indicating 92 to 94 percent.  He reduced collective pitch, ensured the throttle was full open, and began to initiate a go-around toward the west, an area of lower terrain.  The helicopter continued to descend, and the right front portion of the landing gear float assembly contacted the snow.  About the same time, the main rotor contacted the slope of a small, snow-covered hill, to the right of the helicopter.  The helicopter then rolled onto its right side.  After the accident, the pilot said he noted that the wind was blowing about 8 knots from the east.","The pilot's collision with terrain due to his inadequate planning of the approach, and his failure to maintain the helicopter's main rotor RPM during a go-around.  Factors in the accident were a tailwind, flat lighting conditions, and snow-covered terrain."

During engine start, while being pushed back, both engines went to a high power setting.  The airplane pushed forward against the tow bar, sheared a pin, bent the tow bar, and struck the tug.  Before engine start, maintenance personnel had conducted an automated check which included automatic movements of the control wheel and throttles. The flight crew returned to their seats while the test was being conducted.   At the completion of the test, the airplane was returned to service and maintenance personnel departed the cockpit.  The captain initiated the BEFORE STARTING ENGINES checklist without either pilot first completing a cockpit flow setup as required by company procedures.  The checklist was then interrupted by a cockpit visitor and a non-pertinent conversation took place for 3 1/2 minutes. When the checklist was resumed, several items had been missed.  As the checklist was continued, the call out THRUST LEVERS was made by the first officer, and the correct response of CLOSED was given by the captain.  Push back was initiated, and the captain verbalized starting the first engine as required by the checklist.  As the first engine was being started, the captain initiated another non-pertinent conversation with the first officer.  The second engine was then started without verbalization as required by company checklist procedures.  Although company checklist procedures made both pilots responsible for ensuring a normal start, neither pilot detected that the engines were accelerating above normal idle.  According to follow-up testing, the engines accelerated to a power setting that corresponded to the last position of the throttles at the completion of the automated test by maintenance.","the failure of the flight crew to follow the checklist prior to engine start, and their subsequent diverted attention during engine start."

The airplane operating on a 14 CFR Part 135 cargo flight impacted the terrain during a circling approach at Sioux Falls after picking up ice which en route.  During a weather briefing the pilot was informed that the weather at his destination airport was "" two miles light freezing drizzle and fog eight hundred overcast for a ceiling ah their forecast til midnight is one mile variable four miles light freezing drizzle and fog five hundred overcast...""  The briefer asked the pilot if he still wanted to go there and the pilot reported ""Ya I guess they said I have to.""  The pilot reported that he began picking up ice approximately 50 miles from the destination and the accumulation increased as the flight progressed.  The pilot informed ATC that he was picking up a lot of ice and ATC issued the VOR RWY 15 approach to the pilot.  ATC asked the pilot if he wanted to fly the approach straight in or if he wanted to circle to land on runway 3.  The pilot reported that he would circle.  The pilot reported that while circling to land the airplane began to ""shutter"".  He stated that the de-ice boots had become ineffective.  The pilot reported he applied full power and the airplane continued to shutter at zero degrees bank.  He continued to report, ""It became apparent I could not make the runway at this point.  I had to lower the nose to keep the aircraft from stalling.  At approximately 50 feet I lowered the landing gear and crashed straight ahead into a highway dept. equipment storage yard.""  A post crash fire ensued.  According to the pilot, he voiced his concerns regarding the weather for the flight to company dispatch personnel and requested to fly to an alternate airport; however, he was directed to fly to Sioux Falls.",The pilot initiated the flight into known icing conditions which resulted in his ability to maintain control of the airplane.  Factors associated with the accident were the ice accumulation and the company induced pressure for the pilot to make the flight into the adverse weather conditions.

During cruise flight the aircraft encountered icing-conditions andthe pilot elected to divert to a near-by airport.  During the landing attempt, the aircraft slid into a snowbank, resulting in substantial damage to the aircraft.  The pilot stated, ""Trying to get on top after being cleared to 14,000 msl I decided it was better [to] land.  Clearance was given for VOR 12 [instrument] approach at Mitchell S.D. [Mitchell Municipal Airport].  Due to poor forward visibility due to ice on the windshield, I landed on a very icy runway and slid into plowed snow, causing damage [to] the plane.""  According to records provided from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records from Huron Automated Flight Service Station, the pilot had received a standard weather briefing prior to the accident flight.  According to a transcript of the weather briefing, the Huron-AFSS briefer informed the pilot that there was, ""moderate rime or mixed icing in clouds and in precipitation below flight level one eight zero for your entire route"".  At the completion of the standard weather briefing the pilot filed an instrument flight plan for a flight from Sioux Falls to Rapid City.  Postaccident investigation of the airplane revealed a placard located on the instrument panel that stated, ""Warning - Not Certified For Flight Into Known Icing Conditions"".","The pilot disregarded the aircraft limitation placard, and attempted flight into known adverse weather after receiving a hazardous weather advisory.

The flight instructor and the student pilot were practicing power-off stalls in the local practice area.  In preparation for a power-off stall maneuver, the student pilot performed ""the flow checklist (fuel valve on both, mixture rich), and had reduced power in order to slow [the] speed.""  Shortly after this procedure, the engine lost power.  The engine failed to restart, and the flight instructor executed a forced landing to a field, and the airplane impacted a fence.  During a post-incident engine run, the engine repeatedly lost total power after the throttle was reduced to idle.  The engine manufacturer representative adjusted the mixture control wheel, located on the fuel injector unit, ""eight turns toward the lean setting.""  The engine was restarted, and when the throttle was reduced to the idle position, the engine continued to run.  Inspection of the operator's fleet revealed that the idle mixture controls of several other airplanes of the same make and model were also out of adjustment.",the loss of engine power while manuevering as a result of an incorrect mixture control adjustment.

The pilot was on the last half of his first external load of the afternoon when he reported over the radio, "" tail rotor failure, look out landing"" (referring to the log landing crew.)  The pilot released his logs from the lower hook, but retained his 150-foot line.  He flew over the log landing to regain airspeed, but the helicopter's long line then snagged a tree on the far side of the landing, causing the aircraft to roll left and pitch nose down.  The aircraft impacted the ground 250 feet from the snagged tree, nose low, with between 100 and 130 degrees of left roll, landing on the top left crew door post.  During post-accident examination, one of the pitch links on the tail rotor hub was found disconnected from the pitch horn on the tail rotor grip.  The attaching bolt, nut, cotter key and washers associated with the disconnected tail rotor pitch link were missing and were not located.  No other evidence of inflight malfunction of the tail rotor drive train or tail rotor control system was noted.  Examination of the tail rotor pitch change links and blade grip horns at the NTSB Materials Laboratory disclosed evidence of a complete loss of the pitch change link-to-blade grip horn attach bolt before ground impact,  as a result of either its nut backing off inflight or of the bolt itself fracturing inflight.","Inflight loss of a tail rotor pitch change link-to-blade grip attach bolt, resulting partial loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent entanglement of the helicopter's external load cable with a tree during emergency descent.

The airplane was on an on-demand air-taxi flight operating under 14 CFR Part 135 and was destroyed when it impacted trees and terrain while circling to land during a non-precision instrument approach at night.  The airplane came to rest 1.74 nautical miles and 226 degrees magnetic from the intended airport.    A weather briefing was obtained and instrument meteorological conditions were present along the route of flight at the time of the briefing.  Weather conditions for the two reporting stations closest to the destionation were obtained by the airplane prior to executing the approach.  The weather reports listed ceilings and visibilities as 400 to 500 feet overcast and 5 to 7 statute miles. The airport elevation is 669 feet and the minimum descent altitude for the approach was listed as 1,240 feet.  There was no weather reporting station at the destination airport at the time of the accident.  According to the operators General Operations Manual, the pilot was responsible for the dispatch of the airplane including flight planning, and confirming departure, en-route, arrival and terminal operations compliance.  The manual also states, ""For airports without weather reporting, the area forecast and reports from airports in the vicinity must indicate that the weather conditions will be VFR [visual flight rules] at the ETA so as to allow the aircraft to terminate the IFR operations and land under VFR. (Note: a visual approach is not approved without weather reporting).""  For 14 CFR Part 135 instrument flight operations conducted at an airport, federal regulations require weather observations at that airport.  Furthermore, the regulations state that, for 14 CFR Part 135 operations, an instrument approach cannot be initiated unless approved weather information is available at the airport where the instrument approach is located, and the weather information indicates that the weather conditions are at or above the authorized minimums for the approach procedure. The commercial pilot held a type rating for the accident airplane.  The right seat occupant was a commercial pilot employed by the operator and did not hold an appropriate type rating for the accident airplane.  The pitch trim selector switch was found set to the co-pilot side.   The regulations state that 14 CFR Part 135 operators cannot use the services  of any person as an airman unless that person is appropriately qualified for the operation for which the person is to be used.  The circling approach was made over primarily unlit land and water.  An FAA publication states that during night operations,  ""Distance may be deceptive at night due to limited lighting conditions. A lack of intervening references on the ground and the inability of the pilot to compare the size and location of different ground objects cause this. This also applies to the estimation of altitude and speed. Consequently, more dependence must be placed on flight instruments, particularly the altimeter and the airspeed indicator.""  No anomalies were found with respect to the airframe, engines, or systems that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.","The flightcrew not maintaining altitude/clearance during the circling instrument approach.  Factors were the pilot in command initiating the flight without proper weather reporting facilities at the destination, the flightcrew not flying to an alternate destination, the flightcrew not following company and FAA procedures/directives, the lack of certification of the second pilot, the operator not following company and FAA procedures/directives, and the dark night and the low ceiling."

Witnesses observed the pilot having trouble starting the right engine after refueling. Once the right engine was started it made a popping sound. The pilot proceeded to taxi to the runway and takeoff with the right engine still making a popping sound. The airplane was observed to climb to about 250 to 300 feet with the landing gear still extended. The airplane then began to descend and turn to the right. After turning to a downwind position, the airplane rolled rapidly to the right and descended, impacting the ground in a near vertical attitude. Postcrash examination showed the left propeller was rotating during impact and there was no evidence of failure or malfunction of the left engine. The right propeller showed no evidence of rotating under power at ground impact and the propeller blades were locked on the start latches at the 18 degree position. No evidence of failure or malfunction  of the right propeller or propeller governor was found. The right engine assembly showed no evidence of precrash failure or malfunction. The right engine fuel servo had a bent regulator stem which caused sticking of the fuel regulator and abnormal fuel mixtures. The right fuel selector was found off after the accident and the mixture, throttle and propeller controls for the right engine were found in the low midrange position. The landing gear and landing gear control were found in the landing gear extended position. The wing flaps were retracted.  The checklist for engine failure requires the pilot to retract the landing gear, maintain at least the single engine minimum control speed, and shutdown the failed engine and feather the propeller.","The pilot's decision to attempt flight with known deficiencies in the airplanes right engine, his failure to feather the right propeller after the engine failed , his failure to retract the landing gear following the engine failure, and his failure to maintain minimum single engine control speed (Vmc), resulting in loss of control of the airplane and impact with the ground during an uncontrolled descent."

The airplane's right wing struck the ground and the airplane came to rest on the runway following a loss of control on an attempted go-around.  The pilot had received 107.9 hours of dual instruction and was making his first solo flight in the airplane.  The purpose of the flight was to practice takeoffs and landings.  The pilot selected approach flaps on downwind but never checked their position.  On short final, the pilot sensed his descent rate was too great and attempted a go-around.  The airplane drifted towards the left and then rolled right continuing to descend until it struck the ground.  Postcrash examination of the engine and propeller revealed impact damage that was consistent with the propeller having contacted the ground in a high airplane pitch attitude, and a propeller blade angle consistent with a ""power on"" condition.",The pilot-in-command's delayed decision to go-around and his failure to maintain sufficient airspeed during the attempted go-around.

The pilot was applying chemicals at night to a field of lettuce and had just taken off from his truck platform with 60 gallons of chemicals.  He was about 20 feet above ground level and had a forward air speed of approximately 30 miles per hour when he heard a loud screeching sound, followed by a yaw to the left, a rapid decay of rotor rpm, and an increase/overspeed in engine rpm.  The helicopter landed hard, collapsing the skids.  Post accident examination of the transmission was conducted, revealing that the outer surface of the free wheeling unit of the inner gear assembly was worn below allowable limits at the roller/gear operating surface.  The worn freewheeling inner ring gear allowed a mechanical disconnect between the engine output and the main rotor transmission, and resulted in a loss of main rotor speed and the subsequent hard landing.",A failure of the transmission free wheeling unit due to improper maintenance.

The crew unintentionally landed the airplane with the landing gear in the fully retracted position.  The crew did not lower the landing gear or check the landing gear position as required on the flaps-up landing checklist, the normal landing checklist, and final checklist.  According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the landing gear unsafe warning horn did not sound during the entire recorded portion of the accident flight.  The minimum equipment list (MEL) requires the installation of a placard that prohibits the silencing of the landing gear warning horn when the flap system is inoperative.  The accident airplane had a placard that stated, ""Do not silence gear warning horn.""  No anomalies were found with the landing gear system including the landing gear unsafe warning horn, the red landing gear control handle lighting, and the landing gear position lights.  The flap system and ground proximity warning system (GPWS) were inoperative for the accident flight and were listed on the MEL as items that could be inoperative for revenue flight.","The flightcrew not lowering the landing gear and/or verifying the landing gear position as required by three separate checklists, which resulted in an inadvertent gear-up landing.

The airplane was destroyed when it impacted the ice-covered marsh while maneuvering.  A witness reported, ""All afternoon I was watching a metallic gray 2 person plane buzz around.  It was always doing loops or other tricks.  Right before the crash I saw the plane go almost straight up banking slightly to the left.  It appeared to stall - holding its position for a second.  Then it proceeded to fall nose first.  It rotated about 1 1/2 times before crashing.  It almost looked like it might pull out at the end.  It wasn't a straight on crash.  The left wing hitting first then the nose.""  The pilot had received spin training in a C-152 in the fall of 1997 when he received his Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI) rating.  The airplane impacted in about a 50 degrees nose down attitude.  The wreckage path was limited to the point of impact.  The left and right wing leading edges exhibited aft crushing along the length of their spans.  The left wingtip exhibited aft crushing and buckling.  The right wingtip was intact except the leading edge of the fiberglass was broken.  The flaps were found extended 30 degrees.  The inspection of the airplane revealed no anomalies to the airframe or engine.  The Cessna 152 Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) states, ""It is recommended that, where feasible, [spin] entries be accomplished at altitudes high enough to complete recoveries 4000 feet or more above ground level.""  It also stated, ""...entries should be planned so that recoveries are completed well above the minimum 1500 feet above ground level required by FAR 91.71.""  The POH states the following limitation: ""Intentional spins prohibited with flaps extended.""  The POH does not list flap extension as a procedure for recovery from an inadvertent spin.

The airplane contacted the terrain during a forced landing on a frozen lake following a loss of engine power.  The pilot reported he departed Cincinnati, Ohio at 1330 for the one hour flight to Portland, Tennessee.  He then departed Portland, Tennessee, at 1445 en route to Pontiac, Michigan.  The pilot estimated having 80 gallons of fuel on board at the time of departure ""…based upon visual inspection and my tank and dashboard gauges.""   The pilot reported he was level at 4,500 feet, 20 miles south of Pontiac,  when there was a change in engine sound.  He reported, ""The pitch varied for about 3 seconds and then my TIT went to the top.  I immediately richened the mixture.  The gas gauges showed 1/3 on each tank.  I had been alternating the tanks to keep them even during flight.  Another 5 seconds passed and then the plane lost all power.  I immediately switched from the left to the right tank.  I hit the boost pump and after 2 seconds I got a 2 second burst of power which could not be replicated despite numerous efforts to do so.""  The pilot attempted to divert to the nearest airport but was unable to reach it.  A forced landing was made on a frozen lake where the airplane slid across the lake coming to rest after contacting steep bank of the far shoreline.  Post accident inspection of the airplane revealed one quart of fuel remained in the right fuel tank and between 6 and 6 1/2 gallons of fuel were in the left tank.   There was no evidence of fuel leakage on the frozen lake either during the accident or removal of the airplane.  The airplane was equipped with the Rocket STC SA5691NM, for installation of the Continental TSIO-520-NB engine and a McCauley 3-blade propeller.",Inadequate preflight planning/preparation which resulted in an adequate fuel supply for the flight and subsequently in fuel starvation.  A factor associated with the accident was the steep bank which the airplane contacted during the forced landing.

A witness said he heard the ""usual engine pop"" occur about 5 or 6 times as the main rotor increased speed, and shortly after, the helicopter lifted off and rose to an altitude of about 5 or 6 feet. He again heard a loud ""pop"", like a loud backfire, or the bang of metal hitting metal, and saw the helicopter rock to the left, right, and left again, i.e. from side to side, and the nose pitched down.  The helicopter then rolled to the left again, and one of the main rotor blades struck the concrete helipad, breaking a blade. The helicopter then descended, and impacted the concrete helipad on the left side.  The rotor blades continued to rotate, and repetitively struck the ground, throwing debris over a wide area and the cockpit area subsequently erupted into flames.  Postcrash examination of the helicopter revealed that the damage to the tail boom, as well as the tail and main rotor systems were consistent with overload. The tailboom separated at the aft edge of the horizontal stabilizer's location, and the tail rotor drive shaft was bent forward of the 90-degree gearbox, at the tailcone attach point.  The examination revealed no evidence of preaccident anomalies with the engine or transmission. Control continuity was not established due to fire damage. Cyclic pitch control and collective push pull tubes from each respective bellcranks had melted with only molten aluminum deposits remaining under the hardware on the end of each bellcrank.  Push/pull tubes from the antitorque pedals, which connect to a bellcrank and subsequently to dual cables which run the length of the empennage had extensive fire damage, and the lateral push rod had separated at both ends. The vertical push rod was separated at the lower attach end aft of the tailcone attach point.  The student pilot/owner's wife, as well as witnesses stated that the student had transported the helicopter to the accident location via trailer to obtain flight instruction from the PIC. FAA records indicated that the PIC did not possess a current flight instructor certificate, and had last been issued a flight instructor certificate in on March 25, 1985 which had expired on March 31, 1987.

After taxiing and taking off in ""very icy conditions,"" the pilot was unable to get the nose gear to fully retract even after multiple recycle attempts. Because of the severe weather at his point of departure, the pilot elected to continue to his planned destination. At the destination ILS final approach fix, the pilot moved the gear handle to the DOWN position, but the nose gear did not fully extend. He therefore recycled the gear a number of times, with and without full rudder pedal application, but the nose gear would not fully extend and lock. During the landing, the initial touchdown was successful, but as the nose gear was lowered to the runway, it collapsed back into the wheel well. During a post-accident inspection, after prying the nose wheel loose from the well with a bar, it rotated to the full down and locked position.  After the bushing collar bolts at the base of the gear strut oleo body were loosened, the nose gear was able to be centered. The post-accident inspection did not reveal any anomalies in the extension and retraction assembly, and it could not be positively determined why the gear did not fully retract or extend.",an undetermined malfunction of the nose gear system which resulted in the  failure of the nose gear to fully extend and lock prior to landing.

According to air traffic control, 20 miles prior to the intended destination, the pilot terminated VFR flight following for the night cross-country flight.  About 4 hours later, the destination airport manager was notified of an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) transmitting in the vicinity.  A check of the airport did not locate the ELT.  A continuing search for the ELT resulted in finding of the accident airplane approximately 1.8 miles east of the airport.  Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted the ground and traveled 505 feet before coming to rest.  The engine separated from the fuselage and traveled for 693 feet before coming to rest.  There were no reported eyewitnesses to the accident; however, fog was reported in the area at the time of the accident.  The non-instrument rated private pilot received a preflight briefing about 12 hours before the flight.  No structural or mechanical anomalies were observed during the post accident examination of the airplane.  The last logged night flight was on January 14, 2001, and the last logged simulated instrument conditions flight was on November 7, 1999.  The FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute toxicology report noted 7.65 (mg/dl, mg/hg) acetaminophen was detected in urine.  Chlorpheniramine was detect in blood and urine.

The cross-country flight departed in dark night instrument meteorological conditions, and experienced ""strong headwinds"" and carburetor icing.  The flying pilot applied carburetor heat, reduced the engine RPM, and readjusted the mixture in an attempt to increase the endurance.  When the flight was approximately 35 miles from its destination, the low voltage light illuminated and the ammeter read zero.  The flight was diverted to an airport with a precision approach; however, the engine started to lose power.  The non-flying pilot switched the fuel selector from the left fuel tank, which the flight crew assumed to be empty, to the right fuel tank, which contained an estimated 10 gallons of fuel; however, the engine power did not change.  The pilots requested vectors to the nearest airport; however, when the airplane broke out of the clouds at 800 feet agl, they could not reach the airport.  The flying pilot set up for a landing in a field, where the airplane impacted a fence post during the landing roll.  Examination of the airplane at the accident site by an FAA inspector revealed that the left fuel tank contained residual fuel only and the right fuel tank was compromised by impact damage.  The engine was test run following the accident, and no anomalies were noted with either the engine or the alternator.","the pilot's delay in switching the fuel selector, which resulted in fuel starvation in cruise flight."

The fuel tanks were filled 2 days before the accident and the airplane had been operated for approximately 2.1 hours since fueling before the accident pilot flew the airplane.  The accident pilot flew the airplane to another airport where 1 of the 2 passengers on board deplaned; the flight duration was approximately 20-30 minutes and was uneventful according to the passenger who deplaned.  The pilot flew the accident airplane to the original departure airport where he performed 1 touch-and-go landing followed by a second touch-and-go landing.  During the initial climb after the second touch-and-go landing, the pilot advised the controller that he was landing on a golf course and the engine had quit.  The airplane clipped the top of a tree on a fairway of the golf course, then touched down on the fairway.  During the landing roll the airplane collided with a stand of palm trees resulting in a postcrash fire.  Examination of the flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  The engine was placed on a test stand with the slightly impact damaged propeller and impact damaged carburetor; the engine was found to operate normally.  The carburetor had been previously converted from one part number to another; an economizer restrictor was installed that was not specified to be installed.  The carburetor was flow tested which revealed that the carburetor flowed within limits at 1 test point and an average of 6.2 pounds per hour greater than specified at the remaining four test points.  Calculations indicated that the engine/propeller rpm at touchdown on the fairway was 872.  Postaccident testing of fuel from the facility that fueled the airplane last revealed the fuel was within specification.",The loss of engine power due to undetermined reasons resulting in the forced landing.

During landing, the engine lost power.  The airplane collided with trees, and made a hard landing in an open dirt field in the ensuing forced landing.  On the downwind leg for landing, the pilot lowered the landing gear, and the engine began to run rough.  He noted that the landing gear stopped about halfway down.  He attempted to add power, but did not receive a corresponding power increase, and set up for an emergency landing.  A visual external examination of the engine revealed that the mixture cable was entangled in the nose landing gear.  When the landing gear was lowered the mixture cable was pulled out of its sleeve, which allowed the engine to be in a full lean position.  Mixture, throttle, and propeller cables were recently installed by the pilot and his two partners.

The airplane landed hard on runway 03, blew out the left main landing gear tires and traveled about 4,100 feet down the runway before coming to a stop.  According to the pilot he radioed ATC that he had the airport and runway in sight.   At 800 feet he lost sight of the runway because of ""light fog."" He performed a missed approach and stayed in the pattern VFR. On the second approach he was distracted by the fog, but said he did not lose sight of the runway.  He said that the co-pilot advised him to go around again but he landed.  He said the landing was hard, but did not realize he had a problem until the airplane started pulling to the left.  When the airplane came to a stop he got everyone out because of a fuel leak.  The 30-minute CVR recording was found to have no data that could contribute to determining the probable cause, and no transcript was prepared.

Prior to taking off, the airplane sat for about 10 minutes near the approach end of the runway.  The pilot indicated that during this time no carburetor heat was applied to the engine.  Thereafter, when he commenced taking off, full engine power was not produced.  The airplane climbed between 250 and 300 feet above the runway, descended and impacted trees, and then collided with terrain about 1,500 feet beyond the runway's departure end.  The pilot indicated that the accident could have been prevented had he, before initiating his takeoff and while waiting for landing traffic, applied carburetor heat to the engine.  At the time, the temperature and dew point were 9 and 1 degree Celsius, respectively.  According to a standard reference icing probability chart, the atmospheric conditions were in the range considered favorable for carburetor ice formation.  The pilot reported that no mechanical malfunctions or failures were experienced with the airplane.  The engine was subsequently examined, and no evidence of any internal mechanical malfunction was noted.  The mixture control cable was found improperly rigged.  As a result, when the cockpit mixture control was set to the full rich position, the mixture control arm on the carburetor was between the midrange position and 2/3 of the way to the idle cutoff position.  The significance of the incorrect rigging to the loss of engine power could not be established.",A partial loss of engine power during initial takeoff climb due to the formation of carburetor ice.  A contributing factor was the pilot's improper pretakeoff actions.

The airplane was approximately 40 minutes into the flight and 4 miles south of the destination airport in a normal descent when the propeller increased to maximum RPM.  Shortly thereafter, the oil pressure light illuminated, and the pilot noticed the oil pressure gauge was indicating zero.  Subsequently, the engine lost power, and the pilot elected to land in a field approximately 2 miles south of the runway threshold.  The airplane touched down on soft ground, separating its landing gear.  A post-accident examination of the engine revealed that there was no oil remaining in the engine, the oil filter internal element was collapsed inward, the oil filter converter plate gasket was found separated from the plate and broken in half, and the oil filter bypass valve was found installed improperly.  The collapsed oil filter element and blown converter plate gasket are indicative of a cold weather and/or a high RPM start.  With cold oil, the oil pressure became excessive due to the faulty bypass valve resulting in collapse of the filter and failure of the oil filter converter plate gasket.","the improper installation of the oil filter bypass valve by an unknown person, which resulted in the loss of engine oil and subsequent loss of total power during a normal descent.

A Boeing 717 sustained an in-flight thrust reverser deployment following a takeoff.  The flight returned without further incident.  After the prior flight the reverser was unlocked but not deployed.  The flightcrew found the reverser unlock light during preflight.  The crew could not clear the indication and contract maintenance was contacted to lock out the reverser.  The contractor was not familiar and asked for the procedure to be faxed to him.  The contractor used an incomplete set of procedures to lock out the reverser.  Post incident inspection revealed the thrust reverser doors had over deployed.  Four locking pins and their fork shaped locking triggers showed nicks and gouges on their mating surfaces.  Subsequently Boeing revised their dispatch guide to include that maintenance would have to verify that ""no more than one Thrust Reverser Proximity Sensor indicates Open"" and that operators verify that the thrust reverser unlock indication is not present and red lockout pins are present on the inoperative reverser.  Subsequent to the incident the overcenter links were redesigned.  Boeing and the thrust reverser manufacturer issued service bulletins (SB) to retrofit the existing engines with the new link's design change, the link's associated hardware, and rub plates.  Airplanes in production will incorporate the SB items as a production change. Boeing's SB 717-78-004 stated, ""Operators have reported five instances of thrust reversers failing to deploy and ten instances of side beam gouging.  Inspections revealed that gouging had occurred between the over center link bolts and side beam assembly.  One recent event resulted in a relatively new thrust reverser having side beam gouging so deep, it required a doubler to restore airworthiness.  Rohr Incorporated Service Bulletin R715.78-008 provides instructions to modify the thrust reverser actuation system.  The purpose of modifying the thrust reverser actuation system is to minimize the possibility of gouging and inadvertent in-flight thrust reverser deployment procedures given in this service bulletin.""","The failure of the operator to provide complete and comprehensive thrust reverser lock-out maintenance procedures and guidance to the contract maintenance personnel resulting in a partial and inadequate securing of the faulty thrust reverser and a subsequent inadvertent deployment following takeoff.

The flight instructor looked out of his left door and based upon the part of the snowbank that he could see, he  thought he had about 50-75 feet to the snow bank.  However, he was unaware that the left rear skid was already under the crust of the snowbank directly behind the helicopter.  He took control of the helicopter with the intent of repositioning it  to the middle of the field.  When the flight instructor applied the collective to lift off, the helicopter pivoted on the left rear skid, and rolled over on its left side.  The flight instructor reported the accident could have been prevented had he maintained better situational awareness of the snowbank in the field where they were practicing, and if he had used a two stage pickup, where he first made the helicopter light on the skids, and then applied the collective to lift off more slowly.","inadequate visual lookout by the flight instructor on the helicopter's proximity to the snowbank, and subsequent lift off, which resulted in a dynamic rollover."

The pilot reported that about half way down the runway, he increased power to initiate a ""crow-hop"" maneuver.  As the gyroplane started to become airborne it also began a right drift, which the pilot believed was from a left crosswind with slightly gusty wind conditions.  The pilot reported that he ""...adjusted the cyclic control to arrest the right drift..,"" that ""...as the aircraft left the surface of the runway and became airborne, it immediately banked and drifted to the right...,"" and ""...in attempting to adjust the cyclic control to level the aircraft, I either failed to move the control adequately, or I mistakenly moved it in the wrong direction....""  The pilot reported a total of 918 hours of flight experience (all in rotorcraft) and 15 hours in the accident make.  He also reported that ""...the accident aircraft was fitted with an overhead cyclic control stick connected directly to the rotor head assembly..."" and that ""...this type of direct cyclic control can be described as having ""reverse"" control movements when compared to conventional cyclic control systems..."" (e.g., to move the gyroplane right the pilot applies left cyclic).  The majority of the pilot's flight experience was in ""conventionally"" controlled rotorcraft and he believed that he ""...may have reverted back to [the] deeply imbedded control reflexes and moved the cyclic control in the wrong direction....""","The pilot-in-command's reverse application of cyclic to counteract a right drift during the takeoff roll in a gyroplane whose controls had been designed reverse of standard.

The accident occurred during a dark night departure from a private unlighted airstrip.  The pilot had landed, assisted by the headlights of a car, on the landing strip/road about 1830.  After dropping off a passenger, he departed about 1900.  The departure direction was towards a sparsely populated area of rolling hills.  Local area residents reported hearing a plane depart, followed by a loss of engine sound, and an impact in a grape vineyard.  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the airplane impacted the ground in a nose down attitude.  According to maintenance records, the last recorded annual inspection occurred 12 months and about 299.5 flight hours prior to the accident.  Approximately 5 months before the accident, the FAA Certified Repair Station (CRS) that performed the maintenance on the airplane had given the pilot/owner a 15-item list of ""grounding discrepancies.""  The discrepancies were: Cracked nose cowling; fraying seat belts; LH mag switch broken; LH window cracked; LH windshield crazed; stall warning inoperative; turbine inlet temperature inoperative; door latch safety inoperative; several hydraulic components leaking; main gear trunion pins worn; several cracks in wing lower skins; fuel leaks; loose rivets on RH flap; wing spar bolts loose; and elevator trim cable frayed.  According to the CRS manager, the only item that had been repaired prior to the accident was the cracked nose cowling.  However, an engine log entry indicated the TIT gage had also been replaced.  Additionally, several witnesses reported that the pilot had been flying the airplane with an inoperative landing gear retract system for about 4 months.  During post accident examination of the wreckage,  investigators were able to verify that many of the listed discrepancies still existed; however, none of these discrepancies could be directly linked to the accident.",The pilot/owner/operator's failure to maintain control of the airplane during the takeoff initial climb resulting in an in-flight collision with terrain.  Contributing to the accident was the dark night light condition.

During a simulated single-engine out go-around, the pilot reported that he applied full power to the left engine (right engine had been set at zero thrust) and maintained ""blue line"" (118 MPH- IAS).  The descent rate was arrested and the flaps then the landing gear were retracted.  The pilot reported that at this point he was flying by visual cues and noted that the aircraft altitude was descending below the minimum descent altitude, and the aircraft felt ""mushy.""  The pilot crossed checked the flight instruments and noted that the aircraft was not climbing and continuing to descend.  The pilot stated that, he lowered the nose giving up altitude for airspeed, but realized that the airspeed was at the minimum controllable airspeed or a little above.  The pilot immediately applied full power to the right engine, however the aircraft continued to settle and contacted the runway in a wings level and slightly nose high attitude.  The check pilot onboard reported that full power was on the left engine, and nearly or full power was on the right engine at the time of impact.  Both pilots felt that the main landing gear was retracted, however the nose gear might not have been fully retracted.",Best rate-of-climb single-engine speed was not maintained.  Delayed remedial action was a factor.

The airplane  was destroyed when it impacted terrain 1.2 miles from the airport on a magnetic bearing of 003 degrees from the approach end of runway 18.  The CFI weighed approximately 149 pounds and the student pilot weighed approximately 310 pounds.  A witness reported seeing the airplane traveling toward him from west to east.  He reported hearing the airplane's engine initially, and that the engine was at a low power setting.  He reported the airplane was low, about 500 feet, and the airspeed was slow.  The airplane was in a steep angle of bank and in a turn to the right.  He reported the airplane was in ""...a kind of a climb in a bank.""  After 270 degrees of turn, the airplane flipped over on its back and became inverted.  The nose of the airplane then went down.  He reported the nose of the airplane started coming up and the airplane looked like it was going to recover when he lost sight of the airplane behind a tree line.  He reported hearing the airplane's engine revving to full power before hearing it impact the terrain.  An examination of the airplane's system revealed no anomalies.","The student pilot allowed the airspeed to get too low and inadvertently stalled the airplane, and the CFI delayed in taking remedial action."

During the landing slide, the main rotor blew back, contacted the tail boom, and severed it.  The flight purpose was refresher training and the specific maneuver at the time of the accident was training in the procedure for a stuck (fixed) right pedal.  According to the flight crew, there were no mechanical discrepancies with the helicopter.  A run-on landing with the fixed right pedal was made to the 260-degree taxiway.  The wind reported at the airport about 14 minutes after the accident was 330 degrees at 6 knots.  The pilots reported that the wind was 310 degrees at 6 to 8 knots with gusts to 12 knots.  According to information provided by the flight crew, the training pilot accomplished the maneuver: aligned with the runway heading with an airspeed between 55-65 knots; the instructor pilot (IP) held right pedal to induce a 10-degree right yaw; touchdown was estimated to occur about 30-40 knots; the low rotor rpm horn was ""on"" at or near touchdown, but the rotor speed was not noted; the collective was positioned at some point above half travel; cyclic was slightly forward of neutral; shortly after touchdown both pilots felt the main rotor strike the tail boom; directional control was lost and the helicopter rotated about 220 degrees nose right before coming to rest, upright.  The manufacturer indicated that main rotor/tail boom contact from blowback of the main rotor may result from forward velocity and low/decaying main rotor rpm (advance ratio) due to a high collective position during the ground run-out phase following the 30-knot plus touchdown.  The blowback condition is exacerbated by the high angle pitch setting which causes blade stall over a large portion of the rotor disk.  A blowback condition is present in all helicopters.  It may be more pronounced in the MD600N (versus the 500N) due to greater helicopter gross weight, reduced flare/deceleration capabilities because of tail boom length and installation angle, and the increased surface of the additional main rotor blade resulting in a more rapid decay of main rotor rpm.  A caution in the helicopter's Rotorcraft Flight Manual specifies for practice autorotation landings to avoid conditions of ROTOR RPM (Nr) less than 60 percent with headwinds across the rotor greater than 30 knots during touchdown autorotations.  These conditions during touchdown and subsequent ground slide, can lead to excessive rotor blowback, reduction in blade tip to tail boom clearance, and subsequent damage to the aircraft.  Avoid these conditions by reducing collective pitch after touchdown (surface conditions permitting) and minimizing ground run.","The student pilot's improper use of the rotorcraft flight controls, and the instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the maneuver."

During takeoff from a road, a vehicle, which had been cleared from the road, reentered the road and the pilot veered right to avoid it, striking a bush on the side of the road and nosing over.  On the previous day, the pilot had landed on the road due to a broken throttle linkage.  On the morning of the accident, the pilot, airplane owner, and a mechanic returned to repair the linkage.  When the repairs were completed, the owner and mechanic cleared the road for takeoff.  The investigator's record of telephone conversation with the pilot indicated that just prior to becoming airborne, a car used to clear the road was driven onto the road; the pilot executed the takeoff but had insufficient clearance from the car, veered right, contacted bushes, and the airplane nosed over.  In his report of the accident, the pilot stated that the car did not enter the road until the airplane was aligned for takeoff.  Since the airplane was tailwheel equipped, he was unable to see the car until during the takeoff roll, when the tail was lifted.  During the takeoff roll the engine power diminished.  To avoid colliding with the car, the pilot said, he attempted to abort the takeoff and veered off the road.  The main wheels entered a depression and the airplane nosed over, just past the car.",The pilot's inadequate preflight planning and his failure to dissiminate/coordinate the total distance required to successfully operate the airplane.

The helicopter is configured with an external horizontal platform mounted adjacent to the left loading door, between the fuselage and the skids, for use during in-flight transfer of a lineman from aircraft to structure during inspections of high tension transmission line supports. The exact procedures for the in-flight lineman transfer call for the helicopter-to-structure static electricity grounding cable to be clamped to the structure prior to the actual transfer. By design, the ground cable clamping is the very first procedural task and the unclamping is the very last procedural task. When the pilot sees the cable and clamp returned to its holding pouch on the platform, that is his cue to back the helicopter away from the structure. In this particular occurrence, the procedural tasks got out of sequence, and when the pilot saw the ground cable and clamp in its pouch, he backed the rotorcraft away. The lineman, still tethered to the rotorcraft, was pulled off the structure, and the lineman's choice of safety tether attachment point on the rotorcraft gave way under his weight, causing the fatal fall.","The lineman's failure to use the designed attachment point  for securing his safety harness to the helicopter, resulting in overload and failure of the component he did attach to.  A factor in the accident was the lineman's failure to follow exact sequential procedures for performing the in-flight transfer from rotorcraft to structure, resulting in his being dragged off the structure by the retreating rotorcraft."

The commercial certificated pilot landed a wheel airplane on a runway covered with several feet of snow.  The airplane nosed down, and received damage to the left wing, the left aileron, the nose wheel strut assembly, and the firewall.  The runway had accumulated between 4 and 5 feet of snow, and it had not been plowed.  According to the Airport Facility Directory/Alaska Supplement, the description of the airport contains a caution, that states:  ""Runway condition not monitored, recommend visual inspection prior to landing.  No winter maintenance.  Closed from first snowfall until after breakup.""  The airplane was found the following day of the accident, unoccupied, by a local police officer.  The police officer located persons at a local hotel who were pointed out by other patrons as being the pilot and passenger of the accident airplane.

The purpose of the flight was to photograph the parent's house of the adult passenger; the flight was returning when the accident occurred.  While descending for approach to a ball field about 250 to 300 feet above ground level (agl) at an indicated airspeed between 60-65 knots, the helicopter yawed.  He corrected the yaw with anti-torque pedal and noted that the engine rpm and main rotor rpm needles were ""split""; the main rotor rpm was in the green arc and the engine rpm was indicating zero.  He rolled the throttle to the right towards the fuel-on position, then lowered full collective and maintained 40-45 knots while descending for an autorotative landing to the down sloping road.  He cleared a bridge ahead and at approximately 15 feet agl, he applied aft cyclic to decelerate ""somewhat"", and pulled full collective.  He touched down at an indicated airspeed between 20 and 30 knots on the road that curved to the left and later reported, ""we didn't hit real easy.""  He lowered full collective after touchdown and while sliding, the right skid contacted grass on the side of the road causing the right skid to collapse.  The helicopter then rolled onto its right side and slid approximately 4-5 feet before coming to rest.  There was no postcrash fire or fuel leakage.  Examination of the helicopter by an FAA Airworthiness Inspector revealed 8-9 gallons of fuel on board; the carburetor bowl was found approximately 1/2 full with a slight amount of contamination.  The engine driven fuel pump would not produce 2 psi flow and would not produce any flow with a minor restriction.  Additionally, the auxiliary fuel pump strainer was ""so clogged and corroded it had to be removed with a metal hook and screw driver.""  The helicopter was inspected last in accordance with a 100-Hour inspection that was signed off on January 5, 2001; the helicopter had accumulated approximately 24 hours since the inspection at the time of the accident.  Review of the helicopter flight manual pertaining to engine failure when flying above 325 feet agl revealed to maintain 50-60 mph glide speed and to pull cyclic stick steadily back at approximately 75 feet agl.  Additionally, ""when 10-15 feet above the landing surface, level the helicopter with forward cyclic stick and then apply collective pitch, as necessary, to cushion the landing impact.""  The flight manual also states, ""To reduce the rate of descent and forward speed during an autorotation landing, the helicopter's flight path should be flared or leveled out, prior to ground contact.""  Excerpts from the flight manual is an attachment to this report.",The improper emergency procedure performed by the pilot due to his electing to perform a run-on landing resulting in excessive airspeed at touchdown and subsequent roll-over following ground contact with grass.  A contributing factor was the inadequate 100-Hour inspection performed last to the helicopter resulting in the total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.

The lone cabin attendant in the aft end of the airplane sustained a broken ankle when she was thrown to the floor after the airplane experienced an abrupt pitch change during descent.  The captain had the autopilot engaged as the airplane descended through 10,000 feet mean sea level.  The nose pitched down violently about 10 degrees, and then the nose pitched back up.  The captain disengaged the autopilot and hand flew the airplane to touchdown.  The Brasilia has two elevator trim actuators.  The manufacturer discovered moisture and corrosion in some of the actuators submitted for repair after similar occurrences.  They suspected that leaking seals allowed moisture into the actuators, which froze at altitude.  In numerous instances, the actuators functioned properly after descent to lower altitudes and warmer temperatures, where the units thawed.  One unit was dirty, corroded, and had overspray on it.

Shortly after departure, the flight instructor and his student became cold. The heater control was not in the usual position on the instrument panel (both pilots were accustomed to flying later model Cessna 172s). The student located a ""white knob"" but could not read the nomenclature plate. Believing it was the heater control, he pulled the knob. Approximately 1.5 hours later, the engine lost power. The instructor assumed control of the airplane and turned towards a private airstrip about 2 miles away. He instructed the student to make emergency radio calls and try restarting the engine. Strong headwinds prevented the airplane from gliding to the runway. The airplane stalled and impacted terrain. The airplane had been aloft for 1.7 hours when the engine lost power.

During a test flight, following maintenance on the helicopter, which required a functional flight check for vibration and autorotation, the helicopter was observed by witnesses to enter a rapid descent.  During this maneuver, the rotor system was observed to slow down and the rotor blades to ""fold"" over the top of the helicopter.  Pieces, which were later identified as fragments from the transmission cowling, were observed exiting the helicopter when the rotor system slowed down.  The helicopter descended into the ground in a right hand turning maneuver.  Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of either a structural or system failure or malfunction.  According to the helicopter's manufacturer, as the main rotor system slows while under aerodynamic load, the main gear box can ""walk"" (horizontal orbital movement) on its mounting structure, which can result in contact between the transmission cowling and the main rotor control rod ends.  Examination of the engines revealed evidence that engine power was applied when the rotor system was at low rotational speed.  No evidence of preimpact engine failure or malfunction was found.  According to available information, the pilot had received no training from the operator regarding the conduct of a maintenance test flight, not does the FAA require such training.","the pilot's failure to maintain rotor speed during an intentional autorotation, which resulted in a loss of control."

During a descent the pilot noted ""extreme pressure"" was required to pull back on the controls to level the airplane.  The pilot was unable to maintain altitude and continued on a straight-in approach for the airport.  During the landing flare, the pilot could not pull the control yoke ""far enough to roundout,"" and the airplane landed hard on the nosewheel, and came to rest off the side of the runway.  A flight control check after the accident revealed that the flight controls could only be deflected aft to the ""level flight"" position.  The horizontal situational indicator (HSI) was then removed from the instrument panel, and the flight controls could be deflected to their full aft position.  Examination of the control stop on the control column tube, revealed significant chaffing marks and black paint transfer on its upper surface.  Examination of the rear casing of the HSI revealed similar chaffing marks and an indentation consistent with the shape of the control column stop, on the lower edge of the instrument.  Additionally, five shock mounts were installed on the instrument panel, of which the lower right and lower center shock mounts were broken, and the upper left shock mount was not attached.  Examination of the shock mounts revealed they were fractured through their elastomeric center sections on one end of the mount, and large gaping cracks were noted on the opposite end of the mounts.  A large number of smaller circumferential cracks were also observed through the center section of the mounts.  The maintenance logbooks revealed that the HSI was installed in the airplane on August 17,1994, by an avionics facility, to replace the original directional gyro (DG) instrument.  According to the Cessna 210 Service Manual, ""The service life of shock-mounted instruments is directly related to adequate shock-mounting of the panel.

The pilot of the helicopter was looking for a group of people to be picked up at a designated point. Flying over the location, he realized that they had not yet arrived, so he decided to land at an alternate location and await their arrival. He had landed at the alternate location previously but not on the day of the accident. He said the visibility was good, but there were no shadows due to the overcast. The approach was normal, and the pilot used a small pine tree to the right front quarter of the helicopter as a reference point. As the helicopter touched down, the pilot heard a loud noise and the helicopter yawed. Believing there had been a mechanical failure, the pilot lowered the collective control and closed the throttle. Postaccident inspection revealed there had not been a mechanical failure. Rather, the pilot had not seen the snow covered slope to the left front quarter of the helicopter. The main rotor blades struck the surface of the ground and the helicopter settled into deep snow. The transmission separated from its mounts, the main rotor blades were destroyed, and the tail boom was severed.",The pilot's failure to maintain adequate lateral and vertical clearance during landing.

In preparation for an instructional flight, the flight instructor flew the helicopter from the student pilot/builder's yard to an open field across the street for the purpose of added take-off room with  two people on board.  Prior to this relocation, the  forward ballast weight required for solo operations remained on the front right skid.  The flight instructor and student agreed that the student would move the ballast weight  from the forward right skid to the tail boom before getting into the helicopter.  When the student met the instructor across the street, he was concerned about the skids being in the dirt.  The instructor reassured the student that the ground was solid.  The instructor then slid from the left seat to the right seat and the student got into the helicopter and sat in the left seat.  Both occupants forgot about repositioning the ballast weight.  When the instructor lifted the helicopter to hover, the nose pitched down and the helicopter accelerated forward into trees.  The instructor stated that he did not use the pre-take off checklist, which  would have reminded him about repositioning the ballast weight.  Examination of the flight manual revealed that in the weight and balance section, it stated:  ""SOLO flight is performed ONLY FROM THE LEFT SEAT, and must have the ballast weight placed on the front passenger skid.

According to the pilot, the engine lost power while in cruise flight.  He attempted to land in a small canyon, or ravine area, and was unable to avoid a single tree that was directly in front of him in the center of the ravine.  The left wing struck the tree and the right wing was bent when it struck the ground.  The pilot, who is also the builder of the airplane, inspected the engine and found a broken crankshaft at the number 1 piston rod attach point.  The engine had oil and no other anomalies were observed.  The pilot reported that the engine was overhauled 20 hours prior to the accident.  The manufacturer of the engine stated that the engine life for this model is 300 hours or 5 years.  The engine in the accident airplane was manufactured on March 10, 1991.  The manufacturer said they have no service history of crankshaft failures in this particular model engine.  The crankshaft is required to be replaced at each overhaul.  The engine was overhauled at a facility that only provides engines for ultralight aircraft.  The owner of the facility stated that he does not approve of the use of his engines in certified airplanes.

The pilot reported that during the approach to runway 27L with the wind from the southwest at 15 knots and no gusts, he confirmed that all gears were down and locked as evidenced by the down and locked lights.  He reported landing first on the left main landing gear followed by the right main then nose gear.  During the landing roll while almost stopped,  ""I felt like a blown tire, right wheel zig zag and suddenly I could not control turn to the right and landing gear collapse.""  The airplane came to rest upright; scrubbing was noted on the lower inboard portion of the right main landing gear tire and the right main landing gear wheel assembly was rotated nearly 90 degrees.  Additionally, the upper and lower link assemblies of the right main landing gear were separated from each other; the attach hardware for them remained in the upper link assembly.  Post incident examination of the airplane revealed that the bolt that secures the upper and lower link assemblies pulled through the lower link assembly on the nut end.  Two washers on the nut end with a thickness of approximately .023 inch were damaged during the pull-through.  A washer with a thickness of approximately .061 was installed under the bolt head.  A non-mandatory Cessna Service Information Letter indicates to install .066 inch thick washers on the head and nut end of the bolt that secures the upper and lower link assemblies.  There was no record in the maintenance records that the non-mandatory service information letter was complied with.  Post incident testing of the right main landing gear actuator revealed that the unlocking pressure was too high and one of the four lock keys was improperly installed.  Testing of the right main landing gear actuator for unlock pressure was performed by the operator approximately 2 months before the incident in accordance with a service bulletin (SB).  The SB states to replace the actuator if the unlocking pressure is not in specification; the actuator was not replaced.  There was no serviceable tag in the maintenance records and no determination was made indicating when or what facility overhauled the actuator.  The FAA approved inspection program for the operator does not list to inspect the main landing gear link assemblies as does the Cessna Progressive Care Program.","Incomplete compliance with a non-mandatory Cessna Service Information Letter by an unknown person resulting in pulling through of the attach bolt of the upper and lower link assemblies and subsequent rotation of the right wheel assembly.  Additionally, improper overhaul of the right main landing gear actuator by an unknown person resulting in collapse of the right main landing gear.  Findings in the investigation were: 1) Inadequate compliance with a Cessna Service Bulletin (SB) by company maintenance personnel for failure to replace the actuator as addressed in the SB due to a discrepancy with the actuator noted during the post incident testing, and 2) Failure of the FAA to include inspection of the main landing gear torque links in the FAA approved inspection program as described in the Cessna Progressive Care Program."

According to transcripts of the Saint Petersburg AFSS telephone brief of flight conditions given to a person represented as the pilot of N911PL for a VFR flight plan between Tampa, Florida and Beaumont, Texas, on March 3, 2001.  Due to a stationary frontal system lying between northern Georgia and a point in the Gulf of Mexico west of New Orleans, severe thunderstorm watches were in effect, moderate turbulence, strong headwinds, surface and aloft hail to 1 inch possible, wind gusts to 60 knots possible with maximum tops of thunderstorms about 45,000 feet existed along his intended flight path. Numerous SIGMETS, AIRMETS, and weather watches were in effect prior to and during the actual flight. The destination forecast called for IFR ceilings until 2000 local time although the flight plan called for a destination arrival time of 1438. The flight departed Tampa at 1208 and was advised by FAA Gulfport Approach Control that FAA New Orleans Approach Control recommended the flight not continue VFR. Once the pilot accepted the recommendation, Gulfport suggested a heading, but the radar return was observed to take a different heading, start a high rate of descent, and communications ceased at 1422 local time.  A Coast Guard helicopter sighted wreckage pieces at about the 216 degree radial/ 17 miles from the Gulfport VOR at about 1509.  A Coast Guard vessel was dispatched to the scene and recovered aircraft seats, interior parts, personal luggage, and an undeployed life raft. Subsequently, the left wing was recovered and the wing/fuselage attachments underwent NTSB Materials Laboratory analysis. The fractures were indicative of overstress in the upward, (assuming upright aircraft orientation) direction. No other pieces of the wreckage nor the pilot was recovered to date.","the pilot's attempted flight into known adverse weather, resulting in an in flight loss of control, exceedance of design limits of the aircraft, and wing separation prior to collision with water."

The pilot stated that after takeoff the flight proceeded to Melbourne International Airport where he visually flew several practice instrument approaches to the runway which terminated with touch-and-go landings.  The last approach before the accident landing was visually flown using the instrument landing system (ILS); he intended on terminating the approach with a touch-and-go landing.  The airplane was landed on the runway centerline about 65 knots and he retracted the flaps then advanced the throttle when a, ""...gust of wind picked up the wing and turned aircraft 30 degrees to the left.""  He applied aileron and rudder input which lowered the wing but did not correct the heading.  He reduced the throttle when the airplane departed the runway; the nose landing gear wheel and fork assembly separated after collided with upsloping terrain of a water retention ditch.  The airplane then nosed over and came to rest approximately 100 feet from the ditch.  He further stated that he could not recall if he had aileron input applied during the landing roll to counter the crosswind.  A special METAR weather observation taken approximately 10 minutes after the accident indicates in part that the wind was from 210 degrees at 12 knots; no gusts were reported.  Postaccident examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed no discrepancies with the flight control cables for pitch or roll; impact damage precluded check of the rudder flight control cables.  Additionally, the brakes and tires were checked with no discrepancies noted.",The failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll of the touch-and-go landing  resulting in the on ground collision with a ditch and subsequent separation of the nose gear wheel and fork assembly and nose over of the airplane.

	After takeoff the student pilot/lessee of the airplane performed airwork with a CFI on-board and returned for landing with the CFI flying the airplane.  The CFI stated that the flight entered the traffic pattern to land on runway 26, and while over the runway, ""there all of a sudden was no more controllability of the plane by the yoke.""  He asked the student to pull on the yoke but again there was no response.  The airplane touched down on all three landing gears then bounced, then after the second touchdown, the CFI applied rudder input and the airplane departed the runway onto grass.  Evidence of a hard landing was noted.  The yoke weld assembly was found completely fractured approximately 5.5 inches up from the bottom; that point was also located was approximately 5/32 inch above the yoke pivot point.  Extensive corrosion from the fracture location down approximately 3 inches was noted on the forward and left sides of the exterior surface of lower separated piece of the yoke weld assembly when viewed as installed in the airplane.  Extensive corrosion was also noted on the lower end of the yoke weld assembly which contains a rod end bearing and is the attach point for the elevator push/pull tube; the rod end bearing was not free to move.   No drain hole was found in the separated lower portion of the vertical tube of yoke weld assembly.  Corrosion was also noted on the pilots and copilots gusset areas of the yoke weld assembly.  The interior of the separated lower portion of the vertical tube appears filled with a substance mainly comprised of iron and oxygen.  Debris from the separated upper portion of yoke weld assembly did not contain significant inorganic material; an abundance of iron oxide was noted.  Small leaves, metal shavings, fasteners, grass, and dirt was found on interior surface of lower fuselage skin in cockpit area; some of the same type of debris (small leaves, grass, and dirt) was found inside the battery box.  Mold was found on the cockpit side of the firewall insulation blanket (white and green powder).  Examination of the two sections of the yoke weld assembly by personnel from Cessna Aircraft Company indicate that the wall thickness near the separation point was reduced to near zero.  The material was correct and the hardness tests of the tubing revealed they were greater than the minimum specified values.  Evidence of water marks were noted on the upper portion of the separated vertical tube of the yoke weld assembly.  The airplane was determined to be partially submerged by salt water as a result of hurricane Floyd in September 1999, the water level was reportedly up to the battery.  The airplane was then sold as salvage; the then owner reported to the FAA that the airplane was ...""destroyed/scrapped.""  The airplane was re-registered with the FAA; there was no entry in the maintenance records indicating the airplane was partially submerged; none was required.  The airplane was inspected last in accordance with an annual/100-Hour inspection using the Service Manual checklist.  The Service Manual indicates the 50-Hour, 100-Hour, 200-Hour, and special inspection items comprise a complete inspection of the airplane.  The control ""U"" is listed to be inspected in the 200-Hour column.  The airplane had accumulated approximately 12 hours since then at the time of the accident.  According to Cessna Aircraft Company personnel, there is no inspection listed in the airplane service manual required when an airplane becomes partially submerged or submerged in salt water.  Additionally, review of the Advisory Circulars (AC)'s revealed no inspection criteria or advise on what to do with respect to a salt water partially submerged or submerged aircraft.","The total failure of the yoke weld assembly due to corrosion resulting in the inability of the flight crew to maintain elevator control of the airplane.  Additionally, inadequate annual inspection of the airplane by other maintenance personnel for failure to identfiy extensive corrosion of the yoke.  Findings in the investigation were: 1) The airplane was partially submerged in salt water as a result of hurricane Floyd in September 1999, 2) The Advisory Circulars do not identify inspection procedures what to do in case an airplane is sumberged or partially submerged in salt water, and 3) The airplane manufacturer does not have inspection procedures when an airplane is submerged or partially submerged in salt water."

The pilot reported that while en route, ""the oil pressure dropped rapidly followed by decreasing engine RPM.""  He stated that he decided to land on a frontage road for an interstate highway.  During his approach, he ""noticed a lot of dark smoke coming from the starboard side of [the] engine just as I was starting to turn final.""   The pilot reported , ""During base to final turn airspeed was allowed to decay causing excessive sink rate and not completing the turn on centerline for landing.""  He stated that ""touchdown was made in soft sand with high vertical speed causing [the aircraft's] landing gear to fail and [the] nose of [the] aircraft to get in the dirt.""  An FAA inspector who examined the aircraft after the accident observed that a wrist pin plug in the engine had failed, producing metal that entered the engine oil system and restricted oil flow to the crankshaft.  The connecting rod bearings were also found severely distressed.  The airplane had not been operated for approximately 17 years before the pilot purchased it shortly before the accident.  The engine log contained no indication that the engine manufacturer's recommended engine preservation procedures for storage had been followed during this time period.  However, the aircraft received a condition inspection about one month before the accident and was signed off as being found in a condition for safe operation.","Failure of a wrist pin plug in the engine, resulting in partial blockage of the engine lubrication system and partial failure of the engine connecting rod bearings; and the pilot's subsequent failure to maintain adequate airspeed during a forced landing approach, resulting in a stall."

The flight was cleared for the approach to runway 7 and the Captain briefed the First Officer for the approach.  After getting their gate assignment, the crew requested, and was cleared for, the approach to runway 8.  No briefing was conducted for the approach to runway 8, nor was there any discussion about runway length or that runway 8 was a visual runway and would not have lighting and markings associated with an instrument runway.  The target airspeed was 135 knots, and the last airspeed callout was 137 knots.  The flight data recorder indicated that the approach speed was 137.5 knots.  According to information on the Flight Data Recorder, the airplane touched down approximately 2,000 feet past the approach end of the 6,000 foot long runway. Upon landing, the captain deployed the thrust reversers and applied the wheel brakes.

During cruise flight the pilot noted smoke coming from the engine cowling.  He initiated a precautionary landing at an airport along his route of flight.  When the pilot added power to adjust his glide path, he noticed that the engine was responding to throttle input, but the propeller was not.  The pilot stated that when he realized he could not make the airport, he directed the airplane to a plowed agricultural field.  During the landing sequence, the nose gear ""dug in"" and collapsed; the airplane was nosed over.  The airplane came to rest inverted.  The pilot, who is also the builder of the airplane, noted that the propeller drive belt pulley had been heated and distorted, and  the drive belt had separated.  He also noted what appeared to be spots of molten aluminum near the drive pulley.  The pilot stated that the reduction drive bearing and belt had failed for unknown reasons.  The FAA approved manufacturer of this particular airplane kit stated that they do not support the use of non-aviation applications, equipment or hardware on the airplane designs they offer.  The manuals and plans provided with the kit call for Continental or Lycoming engines only.  The accident airplane used a marine version of the General Motors LT-1 350 automotive engine with a non certified V-belt reduction drive unit.","Failure of the propeller reduction drive unit  which resulted in drive belt and pulley failure and a subsequent loss of thrust requiring an emergency landing on soft terrain.

Prior to takeoff in a powered glider, the pilot opened and closed the canopy a number of times in order to communicate with members of his ground crew. When he was given clearance for departure, he closed the canopy one last time, but inadvertently did not get the latching mechanism fully engaged. After liftoff, as the aircraft climbed to about 30 feet above the runway, the canopy unexpectedly swung open. The pilot's attention was then momentarily diverted to the open canopy, and when he looked back toward the front of the aircraft, it was just about to impact the surface of the runway in a nose-down attitude. It was later determined that he had not reviewed his checklist just prior to departure to ensure that he had accomplished all critical items.","the pilot's improper remedial action upon experiencing the unexpected opening of the aircraft's canopy during the initial part of the takeoff climb.

The three-engine jet was parked outside in snowy weather all day.  During the 2 hours prior to departure, the airplane was treated three times with de-ice and anti-ice fluid.  At takeoff, sparks were observed coming from the #2 (center), tail-mounted engine.  No abnormal indications were observed on the engine instruments in the cockpit, but a slight vibration was felt, and the flight crew elected to return to the departure airport.  At touchdown, reverse thrust was selected on all three engines and a  fire erupted from the #2 engine.  Both the flight crew in the airplane, and crash/fire/rescue personnel on the ground responded to the fire, and no one was injured.  An FAA airworthiness directive mandated that a thorough preflight inspection of the #2 engine inlet and bellmouth area be conducted in icing conditions.  The maintenance personnel that performed the de-ice procedure and the preflight inspection, said that a puddle of de-ice fluid was visible in the #2 engine bellmouth area.  Post-accident examination of the #2 engine revealed ""soft body"" damage, consistent with the ingestion of ice, and ""hard body"" damage, consistent with the ingestion of ice-damaged engine parts.

The amateur-built, airplane impacted mountainous terrain in dark night conditions after experiencing a loss of engine power while in cruise flight at 13,000 feet.  The airline transport pilot obtained a weather briefing prior to departing on a visual flight rules (VFR) flight.  During the briefing, the pilot was advised that VFR flight was not recommended and that flight precautions existed for icing conditions above 7,000 feet, the potential for mountain obscurement, cloud layers predominant through the route of flight and the chance of widespread rain.  The pilot reported experiencing weather during his flight and the air traffic controller asked him if they wanted to continue in instrument flight conditions (IMC).  The pilot stated he would like to continue in IMC and indicated if he encountered icing conditions he would ""ask for a 180"" and divert to another airport.  Later during the flight, the pilot told the air traffic controller he was encountering snow.  He called the controller again and reported he was experiencing a rough running engine and that he wanted to divert to a nearby airport and declare an emergency.  The controller then issued radar vectors to the airport.  The pilot continued to ask for and received terrain information as he descended past 5,000 feet.  Radar data and communications were then lost.  The airplane was found on the side of a mountain ridge at 4,700 feet.","the in-flight collision with mountainous terrain during a forced landing following a loss of engine power resulting from the pilot's inadequate weather evaluation, continued flight into icing weather conditions, his delay in carburetor heat use, and his delay in diverting to an alternate airport."

Horizon Air flight 2325, a de Havilland DHC-8-102, on a scheduled 14CFR121 flight sustained an engine fire in a Pratt & Whitney (P&W) PW120A engine while on approach to Portland International airport, Portland, Oregon.  An engine examination and teardown determined that the #5 bearing assembly had failed.  Additional examination ascertained that the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube had become disconnected, and the NL probe port sealing tube had melted, allowing an oil fed fire outside of the engine casing and into the engine compartment.  Investigation determined that the engine had not been placed on oil consumption and daily chip detector examination by company maintenance as required by the engine maintenance manual following a loss of oil event approximately 180 hours previous to the fire.  Additionally, the mandatory implementation of P&W service bulletin 20914, which addressed the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and NL probe port sealing tube was not carried out by the company, nor was it required, as the FAA airworthiness directive making the service bulletin mandatory did not include the PW120A engine.  The investigation also revealed that the company mandated implementation of P&W service bulletin 21446R3, was not carried out during an earlier hot section inspection and immediately preceding the earlier oil loss event.",The failure of the number 5 engine bearing assembly followed by the disconnection of the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and the melting of the NL probe port (sealing tube) which allowed an oil fed fire beyond the constraints of the engine casing and into the engine nacelle.  A contributing factor was the company's failure to follow several maintenance procedures within the maintenance manual after a previous oil loss event.  A second factor was the omission of the PW120A engine from the airworthiness directive issued by the FAA which mandated the completion of Pratt & Whitney service bulletin 20914.  The lack of inclusion of the PW120A engine in the AD resulted in the company’s correct interpretation that the service bulletin was not mandatory.

The pilot flew a normal approach, and landed the airplane, with the throttle closed, on a runway with patches of slushy snow and ice, and some blowing dry snow.  The airplane touched down on centerline, about 60 knots, and the pilot kept his feet off the brakes during rollout.  About 500 feet into the rollout, the airplane began to yaw, then slowly veer and skid to the left.  The pilot attempted to straighten the airplane by increasing right rudder pressure.  He also considered aborting the landing, but given the airplane's slow speed, and its proximity to a 4-foot snow bank, he decided an abort would be unsuccessful.  The airplane continued to veer to the left, and hit the snow bank at approximately a 30-degree angle, about 30 miles per hour.   Winds, about the time of the accident, were from approximately 15 degrees left of the runway, at 5 knots.  The pilot had 92 hours of flight time, with previous experience landing on contaminated runways.",The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll.  A factor included the patchy snow on the runway.

The pilot reported that, following a normal approach, the airplane bounced slightly on touchdown.  As it touched down a second time, the aircraft started to veer to the right and, although he applied left rudder, the plane continued to veer more sharply to the right and a groundloop ensued.  The left main landing gear strut collapsed and the aircraft came to rest on the right-hand edge of the runway about 800 feet from the threashold.  The pilot reported there were no mechanical malfunctions and that weather was not a factor.  The wind was calm.",The failure of the pilot to maintain directional control during landing.

The Canadian ATP rated pilot, who was reported to have in excess of 30,000 hours of flight experience, was attempting to fly the company's Cessna U206G from Seattle, Washington, to Calgary, Alberta.  He obtained 3 weather briefings from Seattle Flight Service between 0823 and 1040 on the day of the accident.  VFR flight north to Vancouver, British Columbia, and east across the Cascade Mountains was not recommended and the pilot chose a southerly route taking him south from Renton, WA, to the Columbia River, then east along the River to The Dalles, Oregon, and then northeast to Spokane, WA, where he planned to stop en route to Calgary, Alberta.  The pre-departure weather briefing, as well as the in-flight briefing the pilot subsequently received, as well as the validity of the weather information provided (forecasts and advisories) was found to be correct and satisfactory.  Although the pilot was IFR rated, he did not file an IFR flight plan.  Additionally, he filed his flight plan as transponder Mode ""C"" equipped, but approaching Spokane advised the tower that ""...we're having some transponder trouble here....""  The pilot's son reported that the aircraft's transponder was questionable.  Unable to utilize radar vectors approaching the Spokane area due to the lack of a transponder signal, the pilot radioed ""...I'm going to see if I can work my way over to Coeur d'Alene or go back south and pick up a small airport....""  The aircraft was observed heading north-northeast at an elevation of approximately 300 feet AGL by a witness driving on highway 27 (2,600 MSL) . The witness reported that the aircraft was under the fog line and then it disappeared into the fog heading toward Mica Peak.  The aircraft impacted trees on a  heading of approximately 015 degrees and in a slightly nose up attitude before impacting the rising terrain near Mica Peak at an elevation of 4,760 feet MSL.  The witness reported weather conditions at his location as poor visibility, strong rain, low clouds and fog.","The pilot's continued flight into instrument meteorological conditions.

While en route in conditions conducive to carburetor icing, the pilot noticed a reduction in the aircraft's exhaust gas temperature (EGT). Although he leaned the fuel mixture, this did not seem to increase the EGT to where he thought it should be. He therefore momentarily applied the carburetor heat and checked for a decrease in engine rpm, as is the proper procedure in an aircraft equipped with a fixed-pitch propeller. But since this aircraft was equipped with a constant-speed propeller, he should have checked for a drop in manifold pressure, which he did not do. Soon thereafter, the engine lost all power and the pilot descended to a forced landing in a soft wet field. Although the intentional gear-up touch-down was uneventful, as the aircraft slid across the field, it encountered a barbed wire fence. In a telephone interview after the accident, the pilot stated that he had been unaware that the proper procedure to use in checking for the accumulation of carburetor icing with a  constant-speed propeller was to check manifold pressure drop. He was also not aware that as ice accumulated in the carburetor throat, resulting in a gradual reduction of power, that  the propeller governor would keep the rpm constant as long as it was able to flatten the pitch of the propeller. He was also unaware that a drop in EGT may also be an indication of ice accumulating in the carburetor throat.","the pilot's improper use of the carburetor heat while attempting to determine if there was ice accumulating in the carburetor throat. Factors include flight in conditions conducive to carburetor icing, and a fence running across the field in which the forced landing took place."

The owner of the airplane said that he and the pilot had flown to Detroit Lakes (DTL), Minnesota, in the airplane so that the owner could pick up another airplane and ferry it back to Fergus Falls (FFM), Minnesota.  The owner said the flight to DTL was uneventful.  At DTL, they checked the weather for the return flight.  The automatic weather observing/reporting system (AWOS) at FFM was reporting a ceiling of 800 feet overcast and 7 miles visibility.  The owner took off in a Piper Seneca before the pilot took off.  The owner said that he heard the pilot over his airplane radio departing DTL.  En route to FFM, the pilot contacted the owner and inquired if the owner got up okay.  The owner responded that everything was working.  The pilot then said, ""You must be close to Fergus [Falls]"".  The owner said that he was 11 miles from FFM at that time.  The owner said he landed right at 2000.  While taxiing to the ramp, the owner said he tried to call the pilot on the airplane's radio.  There was no response.  The owner parked his airplane and went into the fixed base operator (FBO) to contact the pilot on the FBO radio.  Again, there was no response.  A witness on a farm located near the accident site said that he first heard the airplane.  ""We couldn't see it.  It was in the clouds or fog.""  The witness said the ground visibility was good.  ""The airplane appeared out of the fog approximately up 150 ft. spiraling sharp to the right, and going down fast.  It only took a few seconds for it to hit the ground.""  The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a single-engine land airplane rating.  At 2017, the AWOS at FFM, 15 miles south of the accident site, reported sky conditions 600 overcast, 7 miles visibility, temperature 21 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 14 degrees F, winds 150 degrees at 12 knots, and altimeter 29.91 inches of mercury.  An examination of the airplane systems revealed no anomalies.","The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control.

The airplane sustained substantial damage on impact with trees and terrain during a forced landing to a field following an in-flight loss of engine power.  Skydivers had been dropped prior to the loss of engine power and the pilot reported no injuries.  The pilot stated, ""I climbed to 11000 [feet.]  Was not getting usual climb rate[.]  Before decent found I could not close cowl flaps.

The pilot said there was an intermittent loss of engine power during cruise flight . He suspected carburetor icing ""since the Stromberg carburetor, standard [equipment] on the Ercoupe 415C, is prone to icing,"" and he immediately applied carburetor heat. The carburetor air temperature gauge indicated 10 degrees C. The engine ""continued a pattern of power off/power on/power off in cycles of 4 or 5 seconds."" He left the carburetor heat on but soon realized that his rate of descent left insufficient altitude to arrive at the destination airport. He landed on rough desert terrain, extensively damaging both wings and the nose and left main landing gears. According to the Carburetor Icing Graph, a temperature of 12 degrees C. and a dew point of 4 degrees C. [as reported by the nearest weather observation station] could result in serious icing at glide power, and a temperature of 10 degrees C. (as reported by the pilot) could result in serious icing at cruise power.",The unsuitable terrain on which to make a forced landing. A contributing factors was the carburetor icing conditions.

The airplane collided with terrain following an encounter with clouds and low ceilings.  Two witnesses observed the airplane.  One had been a licensed pilot.  A loud engine sound caught their attention.  The engine sounded like it was revving to a high rpm.  The airplane sounded very low.  They heard the sound for 2 or 3 seconds before they saw the airplane.  It came out of clouds with the nose pointing down more than 75 degrees.  They were looking north at the side of the airplane as it moved right to left.  They did not observe any rotation of the airplane as it disappeared behind a ridgeline, and then they heard a muffled thud.  The engine sound simultaneously ceased.  They did not observe any pieces separate in flight.  The weather was overcast and misting.  A weather study indicated cloud tops were generally in the 4,000-foot range on the coast and increased to nearly 7,000 feet in the vicinity of the accident site.  Several pilot reports indicated a broken to overcast layer of clouds with cloud tops ranging from 4,500 to 9,000 feet.  Recorded radar data showed the airplane maintained a northeasterly track for nearly 20 minutes after takeoff.  It then began a gradual left turn for 2 minutes.  The target made a sharp left 90-degree turn, and then made a right turn.  After 360 degrees, the right turn decreased in radius and continued for over 270 degrees until the last recorded target.  This last target was near the accident site.  The target reached a peak mode C reported altitude of 6,700 feet at the beginning of the first right turn.  The last mode C reported altitude of 4,900 feet occurred about 180 degrees into the second right turn.  The accident site elevation is about 2,800 feet msl.  The pilot did not possess an instrument rating.","the pilot's continued VFR flight into IFR conditions, which resulted in a loss of control due to spatial disorientation."

The airplane did not return to the departure airport and an ELT signal directed searchers to the wreckage.  The airplane had impacted a steep rock face near the top of a 4,900-foot mountain.  Witnesses reported that, about the time of the accident, the mountain tops in the area were obscured in clouds above about 4,000 feet.  The wreckage showed the airplane had ""pancaked"" against the side of the mountain while in a 45-degree left bank.  Both communication radios were tuned to the emergency frequency.  During the wreckage examination, the fuel injection flow divider diaphragm was found to have a tear in it.  A tear in the diaphragm during flight would cause the engine to abruptly and completely cease operating.  Examination of the diaphragm revealed that the Dacron fabric was not centered in the elastomer as called for in the manufacturer's drawing.  The lack of centering in the elastomer led to micro buckling failure of the Dacron fibers due to tensile fatigue.","Rupture of the fuel injection flow divider diaphragm due to improper manufacture of the raw material stock from which the diaphragm was fabricated.  The diaphragm tear resulted in complete engine power loss, which required the pilot to descend into an undercast.  The undercast obscured the mountain, which the airplane impacted.  A factor in the accident was the manufacturer's inadequate quality control."

Arriving in the Bridgeport Airport area, the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) received the ATIS, which stated that the visibility was 1/2-mile with snow and fog.  The ILS Runway 06 approach was in use.  Braking action advisories were in effect, and all surfaces were covered with thin wet snow.  During the approach to the airport, with the Second-in-Command (SIC) at the controls, the PIC visually observed that the hydraulic pressure gauge, ""smiley face,"" was normal, and he performed a ""brake test.""  The tower controller advised the flightcrew that a Navajo had just landed and reported a 250-foot ceiling, 3/4 miles of visibility, and that the runway braking action was ""good.""  On final approach, the airplane broke out of the overcast clouds about 400 feet above the ground.  The runway appeared dry, with only blowing snow across it.  As the airplane touched down about 1,463 feet beyond the approach end of the 4,677-foot long runway on the runway, the SIC stated that she did not have any braking effectiveness, and selected the ""dump flaps"" to slow the airplane.  The airplane continued down the runway and did not seem to be slowing to a safe speed.  The flightcrew observed the 1,000-foot marker approaching and the SIC selected the emergency brakes.  After she felt a lack of deceleration, the SIC selected the parking brake.  The airplane continued off the end of the runway, impacted a non-frangible fence, and came to rest with about 4 feet of the airplane protruding onto a public access road.  Examination of the airplane revealed a reference speed set on the pilot's airspeed indicator of 117 knots.  According to the Hawker Siddeley HS-125 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) performance section, the uncorrected landing distance, on a dry runway, at the estimated landing weight of the airplane was approximately 2,610 feet.  The AFM performance section also had a chart for the ""Effect of Slippery Runway on Landing Distance.""  The chart determined that the ""equivalent scheduled landing distance available,"" was approximately 2,150 feet.  According to airport records, a NOTAM was issued the day of the accident, which referenced the condition of the runway surfaces as having ""Thin wet snow all surfaces.""  An air traffic controller observed slush ""spraying"" from the airplane, which extended 5 feet from the airplane, as the airplane rolled out.  The airplane's braking system was tested after the accident and no abnormalities were noted.",The pilot-in-commands inadequate preflight planning resulting in an approach to a runway with insufficient length.  A factor related to  the accident was the slush covered runway which resulted in a hydroplaning condition.

While on final approach to land on runway 6, 100 feet above the ground and 1/4 mile from touchdown, both engines lost power. The pilot attempted a forced landing in a pasture. During the forced landing, the main landing gear was torn from the airframe, and the airplane sustained major structural damage.  Examination revealed the airplane's engines failed due to fuel starvation. The pilot did not report any component failure before his forced landing in the field. He had flown only approximately three hours before experiencing a loss of power on both engines.  He used the fuel from the auxiliary fuel tanks en route to the destination airport and switched the fuel selectors to the main tanks on final approach. Both the descent and before landing checklists require that the pilot switch the fuel selectors to the main fuel tanks.",The pilot's failure to follow the descent and before landing checklist  that resulted in fuel starvation to both engines and the subsequent loss of engine power.

The pilot departed for a cross-country flight.  No record could be found that the pilot received a preflight weather briefing or any in-flight weather advisories.  A partial radar track indicated that the airplane was flying at 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet agl, at an average ground speed of 124 knots.  Radar data and weather records indicate that the airplane flew up the Arkansas River Valley into deteriorating weather conditions.  A winter storm warning was issued, at 0654, from Pueblo Regional Forecast Office (National Weather Service), for potentially heavy snow, and potential areas of blowing and drifting snow resulting in poor visibility.  The airplane impacted mountainous terrain approximately 8,600 feet msl.

According to the pilot, he flew to an area on his property where he and his passenger planned to test some equipment.  The equipment was not related to the helicopter.  He stated that the helicopter was in a 2-foot hover beneath a marked static wire that was 30 feet agl.  He noticed that the wire began coming closer to the helicopter and initiated a descent; however, the wire continued to descend with the helicopter.  Subsequently, the wire contacted the main rotor blades, and the helicopter landed without further incident.

The orientation of the runway was 340 degrees.  The weather at the nearest reporting station indicated that the winds were from 100 degrees at 6 knots.  This would have resulted in a 4-knot rear quartering tailwind and a 2-knot crosswind from the right.  Using the performance data listed in the airplane's pilot operating handbook, the landing distance was calculated to be 2,109 feet, without using reverse.  The Gila River West runway on which the accident occurred was 2,400 feet long.  Assuming that the airplane was flown at the reference speed of 73 knots, with no wind, and touched down on the threshold, there would have been only 291 feet remaining on the runway.  The tailwind present at the time of the accident would have increased the landing distance required, and thereby reducing the available runway.  The presence of an irrigation sump at the end of the runway would have eliminated any margin for error, and made it impossible to overrun the runway safely.  The placement of a truck along the side of the runway at the departure end further limits available options in the event of a long landing or overrun.  Under the conditions at the time of the accident, there would have been no allowance for error either in pilot technique, or in a real or perceived mechanical malfunction.  These factors would force the pilot to make sudden, last minute maneuvers to avoid obstacles at the end of the runway.  During an engine inspection, performed by factory personnel, and witnessed by an inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration Southwest Manufacturing District Office (FAA MIDO-41), the engine was operated up to 30 percent of  its power range with no anomalies noted.  The power was reduced to idle several times and the propeller did not feather.  The propeller operated throughout the operating range, including beta, with no defects noted.  It was noted that with the power lever in the full aft position, the beta plunger was slightly depressed.  This may have been enough to allow the propeller to go slightly past the low pitch stop, toward reverse, when the power lever was pulled back to the idle position.  It was observed that rubbing had occurred between the two controls.  The FAA inspector and assisting personnel attempted to force the throttle lever to move the propeller control lever aft.  The two levers did move aft together, only when the power lever was pulled inboard against the propeller control lever.  However, the propeller control lever could not be made to move past the feather detent.  If the throttle had been closed, the propeller would move to the low pitch (high rpm) position even with the propeller control pulled aft to the control stop.",Inadequate selection of landing facilities and improper placement of vehicles near the runway.  An additional factor was the use of a runway which resulted in a downwind landing.

The helicopter also began to yaw to the left and the wind was 17 to 21 knots, blowing from right to left.  The student pilot then made an abrupt input to the cyclic control and the left skid contacted the ground.  He also applied ""full up collective a little too early.""  The CFI said that the helicopter's left skid dug into the soft ground, and it began to roll over.  He further stated, ""When I realized the helicopter was about to pivot over, it was already too late....""  The helicopter rolled onto it's left side, and the main and tail rotor blades contacted the ground.  The CFI reported he had accumulated approximately 900 flight hours in helicopters, of which, about 800 hours were in the R-22.  Winds reported at the airport, about the time of the accident, were from 290 degrees at 11 knots, with 19 knot gusts.","The certified flight instructor’s inadequate supervision and delayed remedial action, which resulted in a roll-over.  Factors in this accident were the crosswind condition and soft landing area."

The pilot approached the remote snow covered mountain site into the wind.  During the descent at about 50 feet, the wind increased and shifted.  The helicopter began to descend rapidly, and the pilot increased power in an attempt to arrest the rate of descent.  Shortly thereafter, the low rotor rpm horn sounded and the helicopter touched down just past the normal landing site with sufficient force and forward speed to prevent him from holding it on the landing site.  The pilot applied forward cyclic in an attempt to prevent the helicopter from falling off a 30 foot drop.  Due to the low rotor rpm and the inability to maintain altitude, the pilot elected to land the helicopter in a large open snowfield.  During the landing, the helicopter settled in the snow and the main rotors contacted the ground.  The helicopter subsequently rolled over.  The weather at the accident site was reported as high overcast.  The wind direction was not indicated, however, the wind velocity was reported at 15-20 knots.  No mechanical failures or malfunctions were reported.","The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control.  Snow covered terrain, high and variable wind conditions, and failure of attaining the proper touchdown point were factors."

The cross-country flight was receiving visual flight rules (VFR) flight following.  At 1127, the controller provided the pilot with the 1115 weather observation for his destination as a few clouds at 2,100 feet agl, scattered clouds at 3,000 feet agl, broken clouds at 3,400 feet agl, and visibility of 7 statute miles.  Conversion of the cloud heights to msl, using the destination elevation of 6,445 feet msl, indicated the cloud bases were between 8,545 and 9,845 feet msl.  At 1129, the pilot advised the controller that he was going to descend from 12,500 to 10,500 feet msl.  When the controller asked the pilot if he was familiar with the high terrain in the area and the pilot said that he was not, the controller advised the pilot of instrument flight rules minimum altitudes (MIA's) in the area of his destination, ranging from 10,000 feet to 14,000 feet msl.  At 1136, radar data depicted the airplane 40 nautical miles southeast of its destination at 11,500 feet msl turning left toward the south.  An 1130 satellite image showed a band of clouds near the location where the airplane turned toward the south, with cloud tops estimated to be between 12,000 to 12,500 feet msl.  At 1139:36, radar data showed the flight approximately 5 nautical miles south of its 1136 position, level at 10,800 feet (2,800 feet agl).  The last radar contact was at 1141:31 and showed the airplane at an altitude of 10,800 feet, approximately 48 nautical miles southeast of the destination.  After radar contact was lost, the airplane reversed course and headed northwest towards the destination.  The airplane impacted mountainous terrain approximately 16 miles southeast of the destination at an elevation of approximately 10,400 feet msl.  Visible satellite images for 1145, 1200, and 1215 showed an area of scattered to broken clouds just west of the airplane's last radar (1141:31) position extending northward toward the destination.  The clouds became broken to overcast near the accident location.  It is likely that the airplane entered clouds shortly before impact.  The non-instrument rated private pilot had a total of 13 hours instrument flight time.  Examination of the airplane did not reveal any pre-impact anomalies that would have prevented its normal operation.","the pilot's continued VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions which resulted in an inflight collision with terrain during cruise flight.  Factors were the pilot's inadequate preflight planning in that he failed to familiarize himself with the terrain conditions, the mountain obscuration due to clouds, and the pilot's lack of instrument flight time."

The airplane was 4 months overdue for an annual inspection, and the pilot applied for a ferry permit to fly it to an inspection facility.  Two days prior to the accident, a local mechanic examined the airplane, and observed a ""significant amount of water"" in the fuel samples he drained.  He also noted that the fuel filler necks were corroded.  The mechanic drained all of the water out of the tanks, and then ran the engine for 30 minutes with no abnormalities.  The pilot stated that he performed a thorough preflight inspection prior to his departure, and drained water out of the fuel drains ""until the fuel was clear.""  After departure, about 3 to 4 miles from the airport, the engine lost power and the pilot performed a forced landing to a river.  The airplane sank in the river, and was not recovered.

The air carrier airplane experienced severe vibrations and a loss of right engine power following a partial loss of 4th stage turbine blades during the takeoff sequence.  According to the flight crew's statements, they noticed the vibration and loss of hydraulic fluid quantity and pressure shortly after VR.  They then observed a loss of right engine pressure ratio (EPR) and the right engine thrust reverser indication lights.  The flight crew reduced right engine power and landed uneventfully at the departure airport.  The post-incident examination of the right engine revealed the engine event was caused by the imbalance of the low pressure turbine (LPT) rotor due to a significant loss of the 4th stage blade airfoil and shroud material.  This imbalance resulted in rub between the LPT shaft and the high pressure turbine (HPT) shaft.  A hole was eventually rubbed through the LPT shaft.  Oil in the vicinity of this shaft rub was ignited, giving the LPT shaft the appearance of burn through.  The extent of the damage to other systems (hydraulic lines, EPR reference lines, fire warning systems, etc.) was attributed to the duration of excessive vibration experienced until the engine was safely shutdown.  Prior to the incident, the right engine was placed on a 50-cycle continue-in-service limitation in accordance with a P&W internal engineering notice for missing 4th stage turbine blade shroud/shrouds.  At the time of the event, the right engine had accumulated 13 cycles of the 50-cycle limit.  The post-incident blade material loss observed was well above that allowed under the continue-in-service limits, and the imbalance was most likely the result of another event that occurred after the continue-in-service shroud inspection.  The cause of the 4th stage material loss could not be conclusively determined.","the failure of 4th stage turbine blades during takeoff roll, which resulted in a dynamic imbalance in the engine."

The pilot of the skydiver dropping aircraft reported that the engine lost power at the end of his descent from the 12,000-foot drop altitude as the airplane approached a landing 3-mile base leg.  When the engine lost power, he checked that the fuel selector was in the ""both"" tanks position, the mixture was in the ""rich"" position, and checked individual magnetos; all with no effect.  He was then at low altitude and diverted his attention to completing the off-airport landing.  A postaccident examination of the aircraft by the operator found about 10 gallons of fuel in the left tank and 5 gallons in the right tank.  Examination of the aircraft and engine by the operator's mechanics did not reveal any mechanical anomaly.  The cylinder combustion chambers and the electrodes of the engine upper spark plugs were found with a whitish appearance.  The operator reported that the pilot had worked for him for 2 weeks.  When he was hired, the pilot was given about 10 hours flight training as a jump-plane pilot.  The flight on which the accident occurred was the pilot's fourth or fifth unsupervised flight, and required that the jumpers be dropped from 12,000 feel msl.  In cases involving high drops, like this, the pilot was taught to descend with the mixture leaned in order to reduce spark plug fouling.

According to the witness the airplane struck the trees on the east side of a four-lane road, then the median area between the south and northbound lanes.  A post impact fire ensued.  The pilot/passenger stated that on the downwind leg to runway 24, he observed the pilot-in-command/instructor ""...turn the right engine fuel selector to the 'OFF' position,"" as they turned to ""long final, very far from the runway.""  The flying pilot in the right front seat (second pilot), reduced power on the engines to start a descent, but did not realized he had an engine failure.  The pilot/passenger further said, ""...he could see the right engine fuel selector in the off position,"" and the airplane started to ""lose"" airspeed.  He noted the stall warning light coming on, and he said, ""...watch the speed...watch the speed.""  He heard the PIC say to the second pilot, ""...he's right, watch the speed.""  After a few seconds they realized that the airplane was descending ""faster"" than it was supposed to and the PIC started to shout ""Speed...Speed.""  The PIC took control of the airplane in an attempt to recover from the descent, but the airplane impacted the trees and road.  Due to the degree of injury to all three occupants, none were able to talk with investigators; however, the PIC's wife revealed to the NTSB investigator-in-charge that her husband told her there were ""...no mechanical problems with the airframe or engines.""  Examination of the wreckage confirmed that the right engine fuel selector was in the ""OFF"" position in the cockpit and at the wing selector valve.  The right propeller was found in the ""feathered"" position.  No visual pre-impact discrepancies were noted on the airframe, flight controls or engines.

The Airbus A320 contacted the runway and the terrain during takeoff on runway 3C (8,500 feet by 200 feet, wet) at the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.  An emergency evacuation was made during which time the emergency evacuation slide on the 2 left (2L) door failed to deploy.  The captain reported that during the initial takeoff run, he held half forward pressure until reaching 80 knots.  He reported that up to this point, everything was normal.  He stated he released forward stick pressure by about 100 knots and the nose of the airplane began lifting off the ground with neutral stick, which was not normal.  He reported he applied about half forward stick and the nose came back down.  He reported that at 120 knots the nose again began to rise with one half to one quarter stick input.  He then pushed the stick forward to the forward stop and the nose came up at a rapid rate.  The captain reported that his attention was focused outside the airplane and he did not hear the first officer call V1.  He reported that he felt the airplane was going to stall so he pulled the power off and aborted the takeoff.  The captain stated that he was trained not to perform high-speed aborted takeoffs, but he felt the airplane would have been uncontrollable if the takeoff continued.  The captain stated the thrust reversers were deployed and he initially thought there was enough runway remaining to stop.  He assumed the autobrakes activated, but he pressed on the brakes anyway.  He reported the airplane was not decelerating and it departed the end of the runway at a high speed.  The captain reported that deceleration was rapid once the airplane departed the paved surface and the engines flamed out during the ground roll.  Post accident inspection of the airplane revealed the horizontal stabilizer trim was set to negative 1.7 (units of trim), when it should have been set at positive 1.7.  The first officer stated he set the trim while on the taxiway.  The captain did not notice the improper trim setting during the cross check which was part of the taxi checklist.  Further investigation revealed the operator procedures were to set the trim using units instead of percentage of mean aerodynamic chord as recommended by the manufacturer.  In addition, it was discovered that the manner in which the units of trim were displayed on the trim control wheel, on the electronic centralized aircraft monitoring system (ECAM), and in the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) were not consistent.  As a result the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendations A-02-06 and A-02-07.  Post accident examination of the 2L slide/raft that did not deploy revealed an improper chamfer on the telescopic girt bar which attaches the slide/raft to the airplane structure.  This allowed the slide/raft to detach from the airplane when the 2L door was opened.   As a result the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendations A-01-27 and A-01-28.  Being a fly-by wire airplane, the Airbus A320 has two sources of control lag in the pitch control.  One is the latency between the pilot's input and the elevator movement through the elevator aileron control (ELAC) computer and the other is the rate limit of the elevator.  Examination of the digital flight data recorded data for this accident revealed the pilot changed the pitch input faster than the elevator system would respond and saturation occurred in the rate at which the elevator surface could respond to the inputs.  This resulted in pilot inducted oscillations (PIO) during the takeoff roll.","The pilot induced oscillations and the delay in aborting the takeoff.  Factors associated with the accident were the first officer used an improper trim setting and the captain did not identify and correct the setting during the taxi checklist, and the wet runway conditions."

According to the pilot, after about 15 minutes of flight, the airplane was in a turn and descending slightly, when ""the stick suddenly snapped back with no pressure on it.""  The nose immediately ""ducked down"" and the pilot ""pulled"" the trim back to raise the nose while leveling the wings.  After leveling off, the pilot started back to his airstrip.  On short final, he noticed that he did not have enough time and distance to achieve a steady descent with only trim tabs to control the pitch.  After a ""go-around"", the pilot attempted to set up for a shallow approach.  About 75 to 100 feet above the ground on final, the pilot felt ""turbulence"" and the airplane began descending quickly.  The airplane then impacted the ground ""pretty hard"" breaking the left landing gear, skidding about 40 feet, and coming to rest in an upright position.  Examination of the airplane after the accident revealed that the elevator control cable was found liberated from its ""Nicopress"" fitting.  The elevator cable had been replaced with a new cable by the pilot, under the supervision of a A&P mechanic on February 8, 2001.  According to the pilot, the new elevator cable was fabricated for him by an aircraft maintenance facility.  The airplane was given an annual inspection on March 6, 2001 by the same A&P mechanic who assisted with the elevator cable installation.  The last time the airplane flew prior to the accident was on March 8, 2001, when the pilot flew the airplane for about 35 minutes with no anomalies.","the loose clamp (Nicopress fitting) on the elevator control cable due to inadequate quality control during the cable's manufacturing, which allowed the cable to disconnect and restricted the pilot's control of the airplane during landing."

The airline transport certificated helicopter pilot was conducting nighttime aerial surveillance in support of law enforcement activities over a densely populated residential area.  As he orbited the helicopter about 600 feet above a residential area, all engine power was lost.  The pilot entered an autorotation, and attempted to make an emergency landing on a residential lawn, located within the dimly lit residential area. The helicopter struck a small gauge residential power supply line that was stretched across the emergency glide path.  After striking the power line, the helicopter landed hard and nosed down, coming to rest in the front lawn of a residence.  The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the main rotor hub assembly (starflex), tail boom, and fuselage.  Postaccident examination of the Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 turbo shaft engine revealed a fractured bevel gear, part number 0292107960, located in the engine accessory gearbox.  A metallurgical examination of the fractured bevel gear disclosed evidence of radial cracks between the teeth of the gear, consistent with high cycle fatigue (HCF) phenomenon.  As a result, Turbomeca issued a service letter to all operators of Arriel engines outlining an inspection method for engines currently in service, suggesting that the bevel gear will be checked systematically. The service letter reported, in part: ""The fracture was the result of a fatigue propagation. Metallurgical and dimensional analyses have not revealed any defect.""  The failure of the accessory bevel gear will result in the failure of the fuel pump and fuel control unit, and a loss of engine power.","The fatigue fracture of the engine accessory drive gear while maneuvering, which resulted in a loss of engine power and collision with a residential transmission line during the ensuing forced landing.  A factor associated with the accident was the residential transmission line."

The pilot reported that he listened to the airport's Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) prior to landing.  After landing and turning onto a parallel taxiway, the aircraft ran over a 10-foot-long horizontal barricade, which was ""sitting in [the] taxiway"" approximately perpendicular to the taxiway centerline.  The pilot, who was seated in the rear seat of the tailwheel-equipped aircraft (as required for solo flight for the type) at the time, reported that he was doing ""S"" turns for taxi visibility, but that the barricade was obstructed from view by the nose of the aircraft.  Upon striking the barricade, the aircraft's left main gear collapsed and the left wing dropped, striking another barricade.  The pilot stated that the presence and location of the barricade were not announced on ATIS.  On-site investigation disclosed that the barricade extended to within two to three feet of the yellow taxiway centerline.   Review of a re-recording of ATIS disclosed that ATIS announced closure of several taxiways, but did not indicate that barricades were in place on the parallel taxiway.","The pilot's failure to visually detect the barricade, resulting in a collision with the barricade.  Factors included the barricade, and inadequate information on the ATIS broadcast."

The helicopter collided with terrain and rolled over during an autorotation following a loss of engine power.  The helicopter was in cruise at 4,700 feet, and the pilot planned to fly along a ridgeline northwest of Lake Casitas.  As he approached the mountaintop, the nose suddenly veered to the left.  He heard several coughing sounds from the engine.  He entered an autorotation, but could not reach the flat mountaintop.  The helicopter collided with the terrain and rolled over.  The helicopter was examined following recovery from the site.  Investigators established control continuity for the throttle, mixture control, collective, and cyclic.  The bottom spark plugs were gray in color, which corresponded to normal operation according to the Champion Aviation Check-A-Plug AV-27 Chart.  Investigators started the engine; the oil and fuel pressures indicated within the green operating range on their respective instruments and the engine ran smoothly.  The engine was accelerated to 2,000 rpm; a smooth drop of 200 rpm was noted when each magneto was individually cycled.  Engine shutdown was unremarkable.",A loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.

On March 19, 2001, about 1825 eastern standard time, an Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, S/A (Embraer) EMB-120, N266CA, operated by Comair Airlines, Inc., as flight 5054, encountered icing conditions while in cruise flight at 17,000 feet mean sea level (msl) and departed controlled flight, descending to an altitude of about 10,000 feet.  The pilots recovered control of the airplane and diverted to West Palm Beach, Florida, where they landed without further incident.  The 2 flight crewmembers, 1 flight attendant, and 25 passengers were uninjured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the elevators and the horizontal stabilizer. Flight 5054 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a scheduled international passenger flight from Nassau International Airport, Bahamas, to Orlando International Airport, Florida.  

The flight departed in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). In postaccident interviews, the captain stated that while in VMC, the airplane flew normally. Flight data recorder (FDR) data indicate that about 7 minutes before the upset occurred, the airplane was at about 17,000 feet msl, with the autopilot engaged and airspeed stabilized near 200 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). These data indicate that beginning about 1818, the airspeed slowed to 185 KIAS over a 1?minute period as the autopilot began trimming airplane nose-up (ANU) to maintain altitude.  The airspeed then decreased to about 137 KIAS over the next 3 minutes. The airplane continued to maintain a constant altitude as the autopilot trimmed the airplane from about 0 to about 7 degrees ANU. The first officer stated that immediately before the upset occurred, he switched the leading-edge deicing system inflation cycles switch from ""light"" to ""heavy"" and the propeller deicing system cycles switch from ""norm"" to ""cold"" because he saw ""more ice accumulation than he had ever seen"" on the wing and spinner. FDR data indicate that when torque indications for both engines were about 55 percent and the airspeed was about 141 KIAS, the autopilot was disengaged.  The airplane then pitched down and rolled about 80 degrees to the left, then rolled back to near level.  During the next 20 seconds, engine torque increased to about 98 percent on both engines, the airplane rolled about 110 degrees to the left, returned to level flight, rolled about 130 degrees to the right, returned to level flight, then rolled 360 degrees to the right before returning to near wings level, with torque on both engines stabilized at about 22 percent.  The airplane's behavior during the upset is consistent with an ice-induced stall event. The first officer stated in postaccident interviews that the stick shaker and aural stall warning, which is part of the airplane's stall warning/protection system, activated but did not indicate whether it was before, during, or after the upset. The Safety Board's investigation could not precisely determine whether or when the stick shaker and aural stall warning activated.

Meteorological data at the time of the accident indicate that Comair flight 5054 may have encountered an area of icing conducive to the formation of super-cooled large droplets (SLD). The EMB-120 is not certified for flight in SLD conditions. FDR data indicate that airspeed had decreased to only about 137 KIAS before control of the airplane became difficult and altitude was no longer maintained.  However, according to the Embraer EMB-120 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) performance section, the airplane stalling speed is about 115 knots calibrated airspeed for an airplane at the accident airplane's approximate gross weight at the time of the event (23,800 pounds).","the failure of the flight crew to maintain airspeed during an encounter with severe icing conditions, which resulted in an inadvertent stall, loss of control, and structural damage to the airplane."

In the pilot stated that there were 38 gallons of fuel on board the airplane prior to a 1 hour and 10 minute flight to  an airport with no services. At 1 hour and 20 minutes into the returning flight the engine lost power. He made an emergency landing in a field approximately 3/4 of a mile east of the airport. The airplane hit a berm during the landing roll. The nose landing gear collapsed and was torn off the airplane. The pilot later stated, ""I think my reading of the fuel quantity in the site tube was in error. While I was measuring the fuel, I was interrupted, and I think I mentally recorded the wrong amount of fuel, resulting in a fuel starvation accident.""",loss of engine power during cruise as a result of fuel exhaustion due to the pilots failure to refuel. Contributing factors were the pilots inadequate aircraft preflight and the unsuitable terrain for a forced landing.

The airplane was on a visual approach to the runway 38 minutes after official sunset, with no moon.  The airplane approached the airport over rural, heavily wooded terrain that produced low levels of ambient light.  Examination of radar data revealed the airplane approached the airport at 120 knots groundspeed, but descended at 1,200 feet per minute.  The airplane struck trees and crashed less than 1/2 mile from the approach end of the runway.  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the instrument lighting rheostat was in the full bright position, and that there were no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane.  The pilot recorded two takeoffs and landings at night about 1 year prior to the accident.  Previous to that, the pilot had not flown at night for 7 years.  Examination of the environmental conditions at the time of the accident revealed that they were conducive to a ""black hole approach"", a night visual illusion that results in low approaches, and landings prior to the runway.",The pilot's spatial disorientation due to a night visual illusion.  A factor was the dark night condition.

During takeoff roll from a touch and go the airplane veered off runway 08 when full throttle was applied.  The pilot reported, ""I lost control of the plane while still on the runway.  First, the plane went to the right and then to the left.  Power was pulled off and the plane went off the runway into the soft ground and mud next to the runway.  I tried steering to the right, but the airplane started sliding sideways.  When the plane straightened out it hit a taxiway marking light.  The plane then went across the taxiway hitting a marking light on the other side of the runway.  While braking on the soft ground, the airplane went up on its nose and right wing.  The plane came to a stop and righted itself back down on its landing gear.""  The pilot reported the wind direction was 110 degrees at 8 knots at the time of the accident.",The pilot failed to maintain directional control of the airplane.  Factors included the soft ground and the runway lights.

The pilot stated that he had just passed over the airport at 9500 feet mean sea level and entered the downwind leg for the approach to runway 20. At that moment he encountered a flock of large birds that flew up from below. One bird struck the leading edge of the right wing at approximately 3 feet inboard of the tip tank. The pilot declared an emergency and landed without further incident. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing's leading edge, skin, wing spar and auxiliary fuel cells. At the time of the accident, winds were light and variable at 3 knots.

During a simulated engine out procedure the airplane landed short of the runway in desert terrain colliding with brush and coming to rest in a ditch.  The purpose of the flight was to conduct simulated engine out landings.  Both pilots estimated the wind as coming down the runway about 5-10 knots.  The student had landed two previous times with no problems noted by him or the CFI.  On the third landing the CFI simulated an engine out.  When the student entered onto the final leg of the approach he noted that the winds had increased, or were stronger than expected.  He informed the CFI that he was not going to add the second notch of flaps because of the increased drag.  On short final he estimated that at his current altitude and airspeed, with the given wind condition, he would not be able to make the landing.  He called out a go-around, and was instructed to continue the approach.  The CFI then added the second notch of flaps.  He adjusted his airspeed to compensate for the increased drag and noted that the airplane was rapidly losing altitude.  He called out for a go-around and advanced the throttle full forward; however, the airplane continued to sink.  The CFI thought they had encountered a wind shear event, from a straight headwind to no wind at all.",Failure of the CFI to properly supervise the flight and the failure of the dual studen to maintain flying airspeed.  A contributing factor was the wind shear encountered.

On the landing roll out following an emergency landing, the nose landing gear dug into the soft dirt and the airplane nosed over.  During cruise, the CFI asked the student if he heard knocking.  The student replied that he did hear the knocking.  Both pilots saw the oil pressure gage reading zero, simultaneously the knocking increased, and then the engine quit.  The external examination of the engine revealed that the bottom of the fuselage, firewall, and the rear of the engine were coated with oil.  The inspection further revealed that the oil filter had not been tightened or safety wired to the engine.  Review of the engine logbook disclosed that an oil change was completed the day prior to the accident.","Failure of company maintenance personnel to properly install and safety wire the oil filter, which subsequently lead to a loss of engine power."

While on approach to land, about a mile away from the airport, the airplane collided with rugged terrain.  The purpose of the flight was to conduct touch-and-go takeoffs and landings.  No anomalies were noted with the first portion of the flight.  After departure from a local area airport, the student pilot obtained weather information for another local area airport, as well as the accident airport.  The other airport, about 20 miles northwest of the accident airport, reported weather conditions as IMC.  The accident airport was reporting 7 miles visibility, with no mention of any weather; however, he could see the rotating beacon operating.  He requested clearance to land, and was informed that the airport had just gone to IFR operations due to a fog bank that had moved in.  The local controller asked his intentions and if he wanted special VFR to land.  The pilot indicated that he did.  The airplane entered the fog bank.  Prior to impact the pilot saw the ground and pulled the yoke full aft.  Reported weather conditions prior to the accident were 5 miles visibility with haze and clear skies.  A special weather update issued at the time of the accident was reporting 2 miles visibility, mist, and few clouds at 100 feet agl.  Weather issued right after the accident reported visibility at 1 1/4 miles, with mist and a broken ceiling of 100 feet agl.   Review of the student's logbook revealed that he was endorsed for VFR weather conditions: visibility greater than 5 sm, ceilings greater than 5,000 fee,t and winds less than 15 knots.  Official sunset occurred at 1801.","The student pilot's poor inflight planning/judgement to continue a flight into IFR conditions and not divert to an airport operating under VFR conditions.  Factors were the pilot's misunderstanding of his flight limitations, special VFR, and not obtaining a weather briefing from FSS prior to the flight."

On the landing rollout the right main landing gear began to collapse.  The right wing struck a runway exit sign as the flight instructor aborted the landing then made an uneventful landing at home base.  The purpose of the flight was to provide transition training for insurance coverage for the owner.  After touchdown the pilot observed a 5-knot crosswind from the left and applied left aileron to correct for it.  The airplane veered to the right contacting the runway exit sign.  There was damage to the inside of the right main tire, the inner landing gear door, the right main gear actuating arm, and the right wheel well aft bulkhead that was consistent with premature retraction of the landing gear.  The landing gear was electrically tested with no mechanical anomalies noted.",The premature retraction of the landing gear and the failure of the CFI to properly supervise the flight.

During a night flight, the helicopter was in level flight, about 1,400 feet MSL over a lake as the student pilot commenced a turn to the left with a forward airspeed of about 45 to 50 knots.  The CFI then ""came onto the controls"" to assist with the coordinated turn, and noticed that the cockpit turn indicator showed that the helicopter was ""slipping.""  Subsequently, the CFI applied left pedal to correct, and as soon as the left pedal was applied, the airframe shuddered and started to yaw to the right.  The airspeed started to decrease and the helicopter began to ""spin to the right rapidly.""  The CFI then applied full left pedal and the helicopter continued to spin to the right.  After lowering the collective and reducing the throttle, the helicopter stopped spinning.  The CFI then lowered the nose and maneuvered the helicopter toward shallow water near the heavily vegetated shoreline, flaring and pulling up on the collective to cushion the landing.  The helicopter came to rest on its left side in the shallow water.  Examination of the helicopter revealed that the splined coupling at the aft end of the forward tail rotor drive shaft segment was damaged.  Removal of the dust cover for the coupling revealed that the screw and washer, part numbers AN501A10-4 and AN960-10, were loose with several of the threads stripped, thus allowing grease to weep during operation.  The forward tail rotor drive shaft assembly, part number 47-644-18-9, was replaced on January 29, 2001.  The helicopter had accumulated 70 hours of flight time since the last 100- hour inspection and 23 hours since the last 50- hour lubrication.",the loss of tail rotor control during maneuvering resultant from the failure of the tail rotor drive shaft coupling due to a stripped thread which allowed the grease lubricating the shaft to leak out.  A factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing (autorotation).

During an autorotation, the pilot made a hard landing and the tail boom was severed.  The purpose of the flight was to conduct pattern work, and takeoffs and landings to prepare the private pilot for his commercial pilot practical test flight.  During the flight the private pilot was on the flight controls, with the CFI monitoring the flight.  No discrepancies were noted with the first two takeoffs and landings.  During the first autorotation, the CFI noted that the student allowed the airspeed to fall below 60 knots, and that the rotor rpm was moving outside the top of the green arc.  He instructed the student to maintain airspeed at 65 knots until close to the ground, and to raise the collective to maintain rotor rpm inside the green arc.  On the second autorotation, the CFI noted that the student maintained rotor rpm inside the green arc, but let the airspeed fall below 58 knots.  The low rotor rpm warning horn sounded and the caution light illuminated.  Due to the close proximity of the helicopter to the ground, a flare for landing was initiated.  The CFI came up on the controls and noted that the collective was higher than normal.  Prior to touchdown the CFI applied forward pressure on the cyclic to maintain a level attitude after touchdown.  The helicopter landed hard and slid across the ground before coming to rest in a grassy area next to the helipad.  The CFI noted that after coming to a stop he attempted to move the anti-torque pedals, but did not receive a response.","Failure of the CFI to adequately monitor the flight, which resulted in a low airspeed autorotation and hard landing."

The pilot departed Tracy, California, on a nonstop delivery flight to the new owner of the recently sold 1959 Mooney M20A. Approximately three hours and 19 minutes later (more than 470 nautical miles of flight), descending toward his destination of Troutdale, Oregon, the engine stopped.  The pilot executed an emergency landing to a golf course approximately 2.5 nautical miles south of his destination airport and the aircraft impacted trees during the forced landing to a golf course.

During a FAR Part 135 proficiency check ride in the helicopter, the check airman, who was an FAA inspector, gave the commercial pilot a stuck pedal situation after takeoff by blocking the left pedal slightly forward of the neutral position.  Both pilots indicated the commercial pilot was unfamiliar with the maneuver, and the check airman talked the pilot through the process during the flight around the traffic pattern.  The check airman told the pilot to bring the helicopter to a hover at a preselected spot, which the pilot did.  The check airman then instructed the pilot to reduce power to effect a slight heading change and settle the helicopter onto the ground.  The pilot reduced the engine power to idle ""rapidly"" and the helicopter yawed to the left.  The pilot attempted an autorotational landing and flared too high resulting in a hard landing.  During the hard landing, the right main landing gear failed, and the helicopter rolled onto its right side.  The check airman and the pilot both reported the check airman did not brief the pilot of the maneuver prior to the flight, nor did he demonstrate the maneuver to the pilot.  According to the helicopter manufacturer, stuck pedal emergency procedures are not provided in the emergency procedures section of the operating handbook, and the maneuver should be discussed first and demonstrated with neutral pedal settings.","the pilot's misjudged flare during an autorotation, which resulted in a hard landing.

While performing fire spotting duties, the pilot reported to the operator that he had ""been flying for three hours [and that he] was headed to get some fuel.""  The operator instructed the pilot to complete another circuit before departing for fuel.  Five minutes later, the pilot called the operator ""to remind him that [he] had been flying for over three hours, and that [he] was headed to get some [fuel].""  The operator acknowledged and told the pilot to report when he was ""back in the air.""  Subsequently, the pilot set his global positioning system (GPS) to his refueling location and figured that it would take him approximately twenty-five minutes to get there.  While in cruise flight, approximately eight minutes before reaching his destination, the pilot noticed a decrease in rpm and engine roughness.  Shortly after, the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power.  The pilot executed a forced landing to a field surrounded by trees that he had previously flown over.  Upon touch down, he applied the brakes, but the airplane would not stop due to the wet field.  During the landing roll, he made a turn to avoid a ditch which was at the end of the field, and the airplane hit small trees and an object on the ground, nosed over and came to rest inverted.  The pilot stated the accident could have been prevented with the ""use [of] better judgment"" and by ""exercising pilot in command responsibility regarding fuel consumption, wind direction, time and other condition.""",fuel exhaustion in cruise flight due to the pilot's delay in refueling.

The student made a normal landing with his CFI in the conventional gear airplane that the student had recently purchased.  Seconds after touchdown the airplane started turning slowly to the left.  The CFI applied rudder pressure for the correction, but was unable to move the right rudder pedal more than 3 or 4 inches.  The left turn continued, and the CFI shouted for the student to ""get off the controls.""  The CFI reported that he pushed ""very hard"" on the right rudder in an effort to stop the turn to the left.  However, the right rudder would not move farther regardless of the force applied.  The turn to the left continued to accelerate.  Directional control was subsequently lost, and as the airplane ground looped the right wing tip touched the ground and the right wheel separated from the strut at the axle.  The investigation revealed that the student's shoe size is 14, he weighs about 250 pounds, and he is 6 feet 6 inches tall.  During rollout the student's left foot had slipped off the rudder pedal.  It had become jammed between the top portion of the pedal and the console, thus restricting the pedal's movement.  This control interference resulted in the CFI's inability to take corrective action to preclude the loss of control.",The student's inadvertent restriction of the rudder pedal's movement during landing rollout precipitated the loss of directional control and ground loop.  A finding was that remedial action by the CFI was not possible due to the student’s control interference.

A design change was made to the main rotor pitch system of the experimental prototype gyroplane prior to the accident flight.  The change incorporated an increase to the main rotor pitch with the collective in the down position.  The flight was to takeoff from the runway, climb to 50 feet, fly along the runway, and land on the departure end of the runway.  After lift off from the runway, about 5 feet, ""a severe out of track condition"" was noted and the fuselage rolled left.  The pilot immediately reduced the throttle to abort the takeoff and attempted to level the aircraft.  In order to level the aircraft prior to touchdown, the pilot had to increase the collective to keep the aircraft airborne until the roll could be corrected.  The airspeed had increased to 60 mph, ""which was too high [an] airspeed for the collective position and rotor rpm.""  The rotor exceeded the flapping limits and struck the tail and pusher propeller on landing.

During an aborted landing the airplane collided with a fence and came to rest upright in a construction area on the airport.  The pilot received wind information prior to landing, indicating that winds were from 140 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots.  At the time of the accident the winds were from 190 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 20 knots.  On the landing rollout the pilot applied the brakes; however, the airplane veered to the right of the runway.  He attempted to counteract the movement with left rudder input.  The airplane continued off the runway, and the pilot applied full throttle to abort the landing.  The pilot placed the airplane in a climb attitude and made a shallow left bank.  He saw the right wing pass over a box and simultaneously heard scraping.  He then noted that the bank angle had increased and returned the airplane to straight-and-level flight and lowered the nose.  He lined up on a dirt road and landed without further incident.  There were no mechanical anomalies noted by the pilot with the airplane prior to or during the accident sequence.","The pilot's inadequate compensation for the existing crosswind condition, and his failure to maintain runway alignment."

At 1623:41, the pilot requested taxi clearance.  The Green Bay (GRB) tower (ATCT) told the pilot to taxi to runway 18.  At 1626:47 the pilot said that he was ready for takeoff.  The ATCT local controller (LC) told the pilot, ""proceed on course, cleared for takeoff"".  At 1627:33, radar showed the airplane began to accelerate down runway 18.  At 1628:17 the LC told the pilot to contact departure control.  The pilot responded, ""ah papa charlie we have a little problem here we're going to have to come back.""  The LC asked the pilot, ""what approach would you like?""  The pilot responded, ""like to keep the vis.""  At 1628:35, the LC asked the pilot, ""like the contact approach that what you're saying?""  There was no response from the pilot.  At 1628:50, GRB radar showed the airplane on a heading of 091 degrees, at an altitude of 855 feet msl (160 feet agl), and at an airspeed of 206 knots.  The airplane was 1.28 miles southeast of the airport radar.  Radar contact with the airplane was lost at 1628:55.  A witness to the accident said, ""It was snowing moderately at that time.  The road was wet but not slippery.  Crossing the intersection of Morning Glory Rd. & Main St., I noted a white private jet flying from the south.  It was flying at approximately a 75-80 degree angle perpendicular to the ground with its left wing down & teetering slightly.""  The witness said, ""It then crossed Main Street with the lower wing tip approximately 20 to 30 feet above the power wires.  The plane became more perpendicular to the ground at a 90 degree angle with the left wing down & (and) lost altitude crashing into the Morning Glory Dairy warehouse building.""  An examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies.  At 1638, GRB weather was reported as ceilings of 200 feet broken, 800 feet overcast, visibility 1/2 statute mile with snow and fog, temperature 32 degrees F, dew point 32 degrees F, winds 120 degrees at 3 knots, and an altimeter setting of 29.99 inches Hg.  Witnesses at the FBO said the pilot arrived to pick up the airplane after 1600.  The pilot was briefed by the mechanic as he did his walk around inspection of the airplane.  The pilot then got into the airplane.  The airplane was towed out and the tow bar removed.  About two minutes later, the engines started.  Less than five minutes after the engines started, the airplane taxied.  The NTSB Audio Laboratory reviewed radio communications between ATCT and the pilot to determine from the speech evidence the pilot's level of psychological stress and workload.  The examination indicated the pilot's speech characteristics were consistent with an increased stress/workload that might accompany a developing emergency.  Referring to the pilot's final transmissions, ""His unusually long reaction time suggests that he was distracted by competing cockpit priorities and/or was having a difficult time determining his answer, while his fast speech and microphone keying provide further evidence of an urgency to return to other cockpit activities.""  The report states that the pilot's statements remained rational and showed good word choice and grammar.  ""These factors, along with the relatively small change in fundamental frequency, suggest that the pilot did not reach an extreme level of stress.""","The pilot not maintaining aircraft control while maneuvering after takeoff and the pilot's inadequate preflight planning and preparation.  Factors relating to the accident were the pilot's diverted attention while maneuvering after takeoff, the pilot's attempted VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions, the pilot's visual lookout not being possible, the low ceiling, snow, and fog, the airplane's low altitude, and the building."

The airplane sustained substantial damage on impact with trees and terrain during a forced landing following an in-flight loss of engine power on initial climb.  A post impact fire occurred. The pilot reported no injuries. The pilot stated, ""I had just completed an annual inspection on it.  ... On Monday morning I drained the sumps did a full power run up and proceeded to take off on runway 36 for a local check flight.  Everything seemed normal until just after I rotated and cycled the landing gear.  A few seconds later I lost power.  I switched on the boost pump not normally used for take off, to no avail.  The stall warning horn activated and I came down in the trees off the north end of the airport.  I had a fire originating from the fuel line to the distrabution valve on top of the engine.  I exited the aircraft unhurt but neglected to turn off the master switch or the boost pump which was feeding the fire.  ... It seems like I lost fuel pressure from the line at the distrabution valve which did not come off but was leaking.  This caused the engine to quit.""","The fuel starvation.

The commercial certificated pilot and six passengers were en route between remote villages on a VFR scheduled commuter flight.  The pilot contacted the village agent at the destination airport via radio, and received a weather report as 800 feet overcast, with the visibility as 5 miles.  The director of operations for the company reported that the weather at the accident scene was an indefinite ceiling of about 500 feet, and a visibility of about 2 miles.  After departure, the pilot proceeded toward the destination airport about 450 feet above the ground.  About 10 minutes after departure, the pilot said the horizon began to become obscured and the area ahead of the airplane turned white. He said there was no precipitation, rather the ground and sky became indistinguishable. He began a right turn toward the east, but about 2 seconds after beginning the turn, the airplane suddenly collided with snow-covered terrain.  A passenger reported the visibility was about 1 mile under gray skies.  The airplane was equipped with an avionics package provided by the FAA's Capstone Program.  The Capstone Program is a joint industry/FAA demonstration program that features, among others, global positioning system (GPS) avionics, weather and traffic information provided through automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), traffic information service-broadcast (TIS-B) equipment, and terrain information depicted on a multifunction display (MFD) installed in the cockpit.  The Capstone program provides radar-like services to participating air carrier aircraft operating in a nonradar environment of Western Alaska.  Terrain depiction information, based on GPS data, is one of several visual display options available to the pilot on the MFD.  Selection of the terrain mode for display, provides the pilot with color shading depicting areas of terrain that are black (2,000 feet below the aircraft), green (between 2,000 and 700 feet below the aircraft), yellow (between 700 and 300 feet below the aircraft), and red (at or within 300 feet of the aircraft).  Accurate depiction of terrain (in the terrain mode) requires the pilot to manually set a barometric pressure setting in the MFD menu.  The Capstone avionics equipment does not receive barometric pressure data from the aircraft's altimeter.  Selection of the map mode does not provide any terrain awareness information.  During the interview with the NTSB IIC, the pilot said that he selected the moving map display with a five mile scale. He did not observe any warning flags illuminated on the MFD, and he did not manually enter any barometric pressure data into the MFD.  The pilot said that he routinely utilized his own personal GPS receiver that has a color moving map display.  He said he is more familiar with his own GPS, and had it installed on the top of the instrument panel glare shield.  He said that since the terrain in Western Alaska is usually quite flat, he routinely utilized the Capstone map mode with the GPS ""go to"" function for each leg/destination of a route, not the terrain mode.","The pilot's continued VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions, and his failure to maintain adequate distance/altitude from terrain, resulting in a collision with terrain while maneuvering.  Factors in the accident were flat light conditions, snow-covered terrain, and the pilot's failure to utilize on-board Capstone flight/navigation instruments to display terrain awareness data."

The pilot in command, flight instructor stated the engine runup prior to takeoff was within normal parameters. The dual student performed a normal takeoff. While maneuvering 5 miles southeast of Lake Ashby, the dual student applied climb engine power and initiated a climb. The dual student stated that the right engine loss of power occurred at about 2,000 feet. The flight instructor took control of the airplane and turned back toward the airport. The right engine had a short power recovery and then failed completely. While maintaining VySE, 88 knots, the airplane was descending about 200 feet per minute. At this time it became evident that they could not make it back to the airport and would have to make a landing in a field. He assisted the flight instructor with the ""Landing with an inoperative engine"" checklist and at this time they feathered the right propeller. The field they picked looked to be flat with grass. After landing they found the braking was not effective on the very wet grass. At the end of the field there was a 12 feet wide and 4 feet deep canal that sloped down. The airplane slid off the embankment and landed hard on the next field. The airplane suffered landing gear damage. Postcrash examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector, showed the right engine magneto was inoperative The internal inspection of the magneto revealed that neither set of breaker points were opening. Examination of the right magneto by Teledyne Continental Motors personnel, under the supervision of an FAA inspector, showed that there were signatures indicating excessive temperature that suggest overheating of the rear bearing as the origin of the magneto malfunction. The Piper Aircraft Corporation, PA-44-180 Pilot Operating Handbook, states in Section 3, Emergency Procedures, Engine Inoperative Procedures, that if altitude permits, a restart may be attempted. If restart fails or if altitude does not permit restart, see Engine Securing Procedure.

The pilot attempted a takeoff from a ""slight upslope,"" 2,200-foot grass strip with random low spots.  The takeoff was attempted after several days of rain, and the ground was still soggy.  After liftoff, the airplane struck a 6-inch square wooden fence post at the departure end of the runway, which tore skin off a wing, and damaged the wing spar, aileron and anti-servo trim tab.  The pilot then landed the airplane ahead, in an open field, about 300 feet beyond the departure end of the runway.  During the landing, the right main landing gear collapsed.  No mechanical malfunctions contributed to the accident.  The owners handbook stated that takeoffs should be made with flaps up, but only provided takeoff distance data for airplanes configured with flaps 25 degrees, and maximum power from a paved, level, and dry runway.

During landing, the airplane touched down and drifted right towards the infield.  The pilot aborted the landing, but the airplane did not climb, and departed the left side of the runway.  The stall warning horn sounded, the airplane struck a fence, and then came to rest on a railroad bed.  The pilot stated that when he aborted the landing, he retracted the flaps completely from their fully deployed, 30-degree position.  The pilot reported that the airplane reached a height of no more than 10 - 15 feet after he applied full throttle.  According to the airplane's Information Manual, the flaps are to be retracted incrementally; to the 10-degree position until obstacles are cleared, and not fully retracted until the airplane reaches a safe altitude and 60 knots indicated airspeed.  According to the FAA Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge: ""The effect of torque increases in direct proportion to engine power, airspeed, and airplane attitude.  If the power setting is high, the airspeed slow, and the angle of attack high, the effect of torque is greater.

When the pilot departed the airport, the wind was favoring runway 25.  About 90 minutes later, the pilot returned to the airport.  Before landing, he monitored the automated terminal information service (ATIS) of another airport, located on an island about 13 miles south.  According to the pilot, that ATIS information indicated a direct crosswind for runway 25.  The pilot aborted his first landing attempt because  he was too fast.  During the second landing attempt, the airplane touched down, but a gust of wind pushed the empennage to the left.  The airplane departed the right side of the runway and struck a tree.  The pilot added that before landing, the windsock near the trees appeared ""limp,"" but he did not recall the position of the windsock on top of a hangar.  However, after the accident, the pilot observed the windsock on top of the hanger, and the winds were favoring runway 07.

The non-instrument rated private pilot was flying at 7,500 feet on a cross-country flight when he reported to air traffic control (ATC) that he wanted to descend due to ""haze.""  The flight descended to 5,200 feet and the pilot requested another descent; however, ATC informed the pilot that they would not have radar contact with the airplane below 5,500 feet.  The pilot elected to stay at 5,500 feet and repeated that it was hazy.  The final radar data depicted the airplane descending and making a right corkscrew ground track.  A witness, who was located in the vicinity of the accident site, heard the sound of a ""motor speed up,"" and heard an aircraft clear a ridge and impact the ground.  After the impact, he saw the ""flash of a fire ball.""  The witness added that it was ""too foggy"" to see the airplane.  According to local residents, the weather was foggy and misty at the time of the accident.  The airplane's outboard wing sections separated in overload and came to rest in trees on the north side of a ridge.  The fuselage impacted trees and terrain on the south side of the ridge approximately 0.2 miles from the outboard wing sections.  Its measured descent angle was 50 degrees.  All of the control cable and structural separations were consistent with an overload failure.  It is unknown how much, if any, instrument or simulated instrument flight time the pilot had accumulated.  Metabolites of cocaine were found in the pilot's muscle tissue; however, it could not be determined when the pilot may have used cocaine.","the pilot's continued VFR flight into IMC, which resulted in spatial disorientation and the ensuing loss of aircraft control while in cruise flight.

The pilot said that the takeoff seemed normal, and at an altitude of about 75 feet he tried to retract the gear, and it moved half way and then stuck. He said he tried several times with no luck, and then he made  a slight left turn in order not to overrun the ultra light traffic, which had taken off ahead of him, but kept struggling with the gear, and had briefly looked between the seats at the gear to see if he could see an obstruction, and the only memory he had after that  was looking straight down, while in a full stall. A witness said that the aircraft was departing the airport and it entered  a steep bank of about 60 degrees, while in a left turn. The witness further stated that while less than 100 feet above the ground the aircraft stalled, snap rolled to the left, and crashed nearly straight down.","the pilot's failure to maintain airspeed during takeoff/initial climb, which resulted in an inadvertent stall, an uncontrolled descent, and collision with the ground.

The pilot stated that he was at cruise altitude, and had been airborne for about an hour when he decided to transfer fuel from the right wing tank. He said about 2 minutes after transferring fuel, the engine started to ""cut out"", and then it ceased operating. The pilot said he then executed a forced landing to a field, and during the landing the airplane incurred substantial damage. Postcrash examination of the aircraft by an FAA licensed mechanic with inspection authorization, revealed that the carburetor drain plug had drops of moisture that did not appear to be fuel. In addition, the examination revealed that the gascolator fuel bowl, mounted on the firewall, was full of water and debris. According the mechanic, the fuel bowl had a drain valve that was clogged.","the pilot's improper preflight inspection, which resulted in his operating an aircraft with contaminated fuel that resulted in a loss of engine power and and a forced landing to a field and damage to the aircraft during the forced landing."

The pilot purchased the airplane in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was destined for Woodbine, New Jersey.  On the second day of his trip, while in cruise flight over West Virginia, the engine momentarily lost power and then returned to cruise rpm.  This intermittent condition continued and the pilot was unable to return the engine to normal operation.  He elected to perform a precautionary landing in an open field below him.  After main wheel touchdown, the nose wheel touched down, and dug into the soft ground.  The airplane nosed over, and came to rest inverted.  Examination revealed that the mixture control cable housing had come loose, which allowed it to move toward the idle cut-off position.  The engine ran satisfactorily after the mixture control cable housing was properly secured.","a loose mixture control cable housing which resulted in an intermittent running engine, and the pilot's subsequent decision to perform a precautionary landing.

The airplane contacted a rock and directional control was lost during a forced landing following a loss of engine power.  The pilot reported the engine quit while he was six miles out over the water from the shoreline of Lake Michigan.  The pilot reported he was able to temporarily restore engine power as he positioned the airplane for a forced landing.  The right main gear separated from the airplane during the landing roll after it contacted a large rock.  The airplane came to rest part way down an embankment.  Examination of the airplane after the accident revealed the carburetor had separated from the engine; however, there was no evidence of fuel leakage at the accident site.  One and one-half ounces of fuel were drained from the fuel line between the header fuel tank and the fuel selector.  The fuel gages indicated the right tank was empty and the left tank contained 1/3 tank of fuel.  A visual inspection of both tanks revealed they were empty.  The airplane had been modified with an extended range fuel system.  The airplane had not been flown since September, 2000.  The pilot reported that three days prior to the accident, he noticed fuel leaking out of the carburetor.  He reported that he was told by a mechanic and the airplane owner that the float needle was stuck and that he should tap the carburetor with a wrench.  He reported he did this, then flew the airplane around the traffic pattern.  The airplane  then sat until the day of the accident.  The pilot reported he did not visually check the fuel level prior to takeoff on the accident flight.","The inadequate preflight performed by the pilot which resulted in an insufficient fuel supply and the subsequent fuel exhaustion.  Factors associated with the accident were the inaccurate fuel quantity indicator, the rock which resulted in the overload failure of the right main landing gear, and the embankment which the airplane traveled down."

The student pilot/passenger had recently traded the airplane and the new owner had contracted with the commercial pilot to ferry the airplane to his home base. The purpose of this flight was for the commercial pilot to familiarize himself with the airplane. The commercial pilot had no previous experience in this make/model of aircraft. A witness saw the airplane  ""flying very slowly"" on the downwind leg approximately 200 feet agl. When the airplane was abeam the runway threshold, it ""rolled to the left and dove inverted"" into the ground.

The pilot/owner prepared to land on an estimated 7 degree slope with the right/uphill skid first.  When the right skid made contact with the ground, the helicopter began to rock back and forth longitudinally.  The pilot then lifted the helicopter back up into the air, but it nosed forward.  To counteract the nose down attitude, the pilot applied aft cyclic, but it did not arrest the situation.  The pilot was then concerned about striking trees that were directly in front of him, so he ""dropped"" the collective to set the helicopter down again.  However, the helicopter landed on the front part of the skids, and rolled over onto its nose, and came to rest on its left side.  According to Advisory Circular 90-87-Helicopter Dynamic Rollover, ""During normal or slope take-offs and landings with the same degree of bank angle or side drift with one skid on the ground, the bank angle or side drift can place the helicopter in a situation where it is pivoting (rolling) about a skid, which is still in contact with the ground.  When the uphill slope skid hits the ground, the dynamics of the motion can cause the helicopter to bounce off the upslope skid, and the inertia can cause the helicopter to roll about the downslope ground contact point and over onto its side.  The collective should not be pulled suddenly to get airborne, as a large and abrupt rolling moment in the opposite direction will result.  This movement can be uncontrollable.  If the helicopter develops a roll rate with one skid on the ground, the helicopter can roll over on its side.""  The pilot reported that there were no mechanical deficiencies.","pilot's failure to properly control the helicopter during a slope landing, which resulted in a dynamic rollover."

The pilot took off towards the south, flew a left downwind leg, then turned west onto a left base leg.  At the time, he was maintaining a 500-foot altitude, and 6,000 rpm on the airplane's Rotax 503 engine.  As the airplane continued along the base leg, it began a descent.  While passing through 400 feet, the engine experienced a partial power loss, and thereafter would not provide any more than 3,000 rpm.  The airplane continued its descent, and struck power lines that approximately paralleled the runway, at a height of 60 feet.  It subsequently impacted the ground, and was consumed by fire.  Post-flight inspection revealed that the engine rotated freely; however, due to its condition, further engine examination was not performed.  Winds at the time of the accident were from 270 degrees true, at 14, gusting to 19 knots.

Witnesses observed N262MM taxi to runway 29 left and the pilot perform what appeared to be a normal engine runup. The airplane then taxied onto runway 29 left for takeoff. The wind was from the east, making the takeoff with a tail wind. During the takeoff, the engine seemed to operate at a steady level, but appeared to be low on power. The flight lifted off about halfway down the runway and the landing gear was retracted. The airplane climbed slowly and turned slowly to the left. The airplane then entered a 60-80 degree left bank followed by the airplane rolling level and the wings rocking back and forth. The airplane was now on a southerly heading and the nose dropped. The airplane then collided with trees about 15-20 feet above the ground, fell to the ground, and burst into flames. Witnesses stated they saw no smoke or flames coming from the airplane prior to impact with the trees. At the time of the accident the landing gear was retracted and the engine was running. Transcripts of recorded communications show that at 1205:40, the local controller instructed the flight to taxi into position and hold on runway 29 left. At 1206:43, N262MM was cleared for takeoff and a north bound departure was approved. At 1208:03, the passenger transmitted ""we need to land we have to turn around"". The local controller cleared the flight to return to the airport when able. At 1208:20, the passenger transmitted ""two mike mike we're going down we're going down"", followed by ""over the golf (unintelligible)"". The local controller responded ""copy over the golf course"". No further transmissions were received from the flight. Analysis of background noise contained on the ATC recordings show that at the time the passenger on N262MM transmitted to controllers that they were ready for takeoff and when he acknowledged the takeoff clearance, the propeller was rotating at 1,261 and 1,255 respectively. When the passenger transmitted to controllers after takeoff, that they needed to land, the propeller was rotating at 1,980 rpm. When the passenger transmitted we have to turn around, shortly after the above transmission, the propeller was rotating at 2,017 rpm. When the passenger made his last transmission stating they were going down, the propeller rpm was 1,965. The maximum propeller speed at takeoff is 2,000 rpm. Additional evidence was found indicating electrical arcing and progressive fatigue cracking in the engine’s P3 line, which could result in a rapid rollback of engine power. Simulator testing showed that a P3 line failure would result in the engine decelerating from full takeoff power (2,000 propeller rpm) and stabilizing at an idle power setting in less than 9 seconds. However, the sound spectrum analysis of the first radio transmission indicated the propeller rpm was 1,980, and two subsequent radio transmissions, the last of which was made 17 seconds after the initial transmission, detected the propeller rpm at near takeoff speed. Thus, there was no evidence of dramatic rpm loss, making the P3 line failure an unlikely cause of the accident. Postcrash examination of the aircraft structure, flight controls, engine, and propeller, showed no evidence of failure or malfunction. Witnesses indicated the flight used about 3,650 feet of runway for takeoff or about half of the 7,296 foot long runway. Charts contained in the Piper PA-46-500TP, Pilot's Operating Handbook, indicated that for the conditions at the time of the accident, the airplane should have used about 2,000 feet of runway for the ground roll during the takeoff with no wing flaps extended. The charts also show that the airplane indicated stall speed at 60 degrees of bank angle with the landing gear and wing flaps retracted is 111 knots.",The pilot's excessive bank angle and his failure to maintain airspeed while returning to the airport after takeoff due to an unspecified problem resulting in the airplane stalling and colliding with trees during the resultant uncontrolled descent.

The student said he had some difficulty with the traffic pattern and that during the landing as he started reducing power and initiating the flare,  it seemed like it was a high flare, and they hit the runway hard. He said the instructor told him to go around, so he gave the airplane full power and tried to liftoff, but he ""blew to the left, and headed off the runway."" The instructor stated that she immediately told the student to go around, but as he added power,  the airplane headed hard to the left, and did not liftoff. She said she yelled ""my controls"" but the left wing hit the wind sock. She said she did not know what caused the airplane to turn so severely, and further stated that she taught the student ""CRAMB, CLIMB, CLEAN, COMUNICATE,""  when executing go-arounds, and the ""CLEAN"" part of the sequence had not been performed, since the climb had not been established. She said that full flaps were still down, and had been down before, during, and after the event. The instructor said that the student has large feet and she had warned him several times about making sure they were far enough back on the floor so that he would not hit the brakes accidentally.  A functional check of the aircraft did not identify any preaccident failure or malfunction to the aircraft or any if its systems. The information handbook for the Cessna 172R, Section 4 specifies that the wing flaps must be retracted to 20 degrees immediately after the application of full throttle while executing balked landings.",the flight instructor's inadequate supervision  and the dual student's improper use of brakes which resulted in the loss of directional control and collision with a wind sock. Contributing to the accident was the flight instructor's failure to follow procedures/directives.

The passenger stated the deceased pilot applied full power and started the takeoff roll on runway 09. Review of the surface weather observation for the airport revealed the pilot was taking off with a tailwind. A short time later the pilot was observed by the passenger to pull back on the flight controls to rotate, and the tail collided with the ground slowing the airplane down. The pilot lowered the nose in an attempt to regain airspeed and attempted to rotate again with the same results. He repeated his actions one more time with negative results. The passenger observed the end of the runway approaching. The pilot said something, but he could not understand him. The pilot pulled the throttle back, but did not apply any brakes before the airplane went off the end of the runway and collided with a ditch. Examination of the airframe, flight controls, engine assembly and accessories revealed no evidence of a precrash mechanical failure or malfunction.","	The pilot's delay in aborting the takeoff in a downwind condition resulting in an overrun and subsequent collision with a ditch. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to conduct performance planning for the flight."

The composite aircraft impacted the side of a mountain approximately 20 minutes prior to sunset after the noninstrument rated private pilot departed on a cross-country flight.  The pilot obtained printed weather information via a DUATs system approximately 9 hours prior to the flight's departure.  AIRMETS for mountain obscurement, moderate turbulence and moderate rime/mixed icing conditions were in effect, and included the area of the accident site.  Previous weather observations from the departure airport reported snow showers located over the mountains in the vicinity of the flight's route.  A witness located near the accident site, reported he could not see the base of the mountain throughout the day due to sleet, snow, rain, and wind.  Nearby airport weather observations indicated VFR weather conditions; however, forecasts for the flight route indicated there was still a chance of mountain obscurement.  No evidence was found that the pilot obtained updated weather information for the route of flight prior to taking off.

A witness stated that she heard an aircraft flying low, with its engine operating ""fast"",  pass over her house, so she ran out of the house for fear it would hit  the house.  She further stated that she then saw the airplane, just above treetop level, in the direction of the Claxton-Evans County Airport, in an extreme nose low pitch attitude. She said the airplane had been ""falling fast, and the engine sounded wide open, or full throttle."" She also said that ""the wings were rocking, and it was obvious to her that the pilot was fighting hard to keep the airplane stable and level.""  According to the witness, she then saw the  airplane drop into the trees, and heard the crash.  She said she then got into her car and sped to the airport, and as she approached the airport, she saw the airplane at the edge of the trees. The witness said that she then saw an explosion, followed by a fireball which shot about 300 feet into the air, followed by a column of black smoke. She then ran into the airport manager's office and reported the accident. When she returned, she saw a man emerging from the woods, who had been badly burned. The pilot/owner of the accident airplane received fatal injuries as a result of the accident. The pilot rated passenger who survived the accident and who went through an extensive period of hospitalization later stated that his memory is fragmented, but that he remembered the run-up and takeoff, and that everything was normal until they were in the air when he saw fuel streaming  back over the left wing. He said he could not see the fuel cap to see what the trouble was, and he remembers asking the pilot/owner if he needed some help, but did not remember the pilot/owner's answer, or if he gave any assistance to the pilot in handling the airplane. He said the next thing he remembered was telling the pilot ""we're not going to make it"", followed by the impact. Examination of the airplane revealed that the left fuel cap had separated from the wing, and it was found in the area of the airplane's initial impact with trees while the pilot had been returning to land at the airport he had just departed from. No preaccident failures or malfunctions were noted to the airplane's structure flight controls, or engine as a result of the postcrash examination.","The pilot in command's failure to maintain airspeed while performing an emergency  landing after having just taken off with an unsecured fuel cap, which resulted in an inadvertent stall mush, an uncontrolled descent, and an impact with trees."

In a telephone call to the Seattle Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) about 20 minutes before departure, the pilot asked for the current conditions for the departure and destination airports.  Both airports were reporting marginal visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, with conditions worse at the destination.  The ceilings at both locations were lower than forecast at the time of the call, and were forecast to lower during the planned flight.  When offered terminal forecasts and other weather information by the briefer, the pilot declined.  Shortly thereafter, the flight departed under VFR during dark night conditions; no flight plan was filed and no air traffic services were provided.  While flying toward the destination at low altitude, the flight encountered an area of rapidly deteriorating weather including low ceilings, rain, and snow.  The airplane subsequently struck a stand of trees, separating its left wing, and crashed.  Post-accident examinations of the aircraft and engine did not reveal any evidence of pre-impact mechanical or structural defects with the aircraft or engine.  The aircraft's emergency locator transmitter (ELT) did not activate in the crash; the flight was not reported missing for several hours and was not located until several hours after being reported missing.  Investigators found the switch on the ELT, whose battery had been changed 2 months before the accident, in the OFF position in the wreckage.  The ELT functioned as designed when checked with the switch in the ON and ARMED positions.","The pilot's failure to maintain altitude and/or clearance over trees, resulting in a collision with trees, separation of a wing and uncontrolled collision with terrain.

The pilot took off on runway 34 and climbed to 5,000 feet msl.  After leveling off, the engine started to shake violently.  The pilot turned to initiate a forced landing on runway 16 and realized he was not going to make the runway, but was going to make the gravel run-out area. The pilot said that he maintained 55 mph until the beginning of the flare.  He said the airplane's energy bleeds off very fast, and the flare is done at the last moment.  Upon landing the left main landing gear collapsed, and the fuselage hit the ground and skidded for 35 to 50 yards.  The pilot stated ""that a FOD (dental pick) used in maintenance two days earlier and not found in two to three times going over the engine and one preflight, had dislodged from [a] hiding place and hit the prop.""  A 2 x 2 inch section of propeller tip was missing.","the pilot's misjudged landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing.  A factor was the propeller tip separation due to foreign object damage."

The night cross country visual flight rules flight had been airborne for 3 hours and 37 minutes when the instrument rated pilot reported to a local flight service station (FSS) that he had 10 minutes of fuel on board, and was disoriented.  The FSS connected the pilot with the Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center, who provided radar vectors to the nearest airport.  However, 10 minutes later the pilot reported that he had run out of fuel and, subsequently, the final radar return was received.  The airplane impacted a fence and trees 10 miles north of the destination airport.  Review of the radar track revealed that, during the final 36 minutes of the flight, the airplane was not maintaining a constant altitude and had been making ""S"" turns, 360-degree turns, and at one point had flown past the destination airport.  Marginal visual meteorological conditions and patchy instrument meteorological conditions existed near the accident site and destination airport.  There was no record of the pilot having received a weather briefing from a flight service station prior to or during the flight.  The airplane was examined and the integrity of the fuel system was confirmed.  Further examination of the fuel system revealed that only unusable fuel was present in the fuel system.  No anomalies were found with the airframe or engine that would have precluded operation of the airplane.","the pilot's delay in taking remedial action (contacting ATC) after he became lost/disoriented during a night cross country flight, which resulted in a forced landing due to fuel exhaustion.

The pilot stated that the first flight departed at 1915 to spray chemical for mosquitoes but returned due to plugged spray nozzles that he noted midpoint of the second spray pass.  Without securing the engine, the plugged nozzles were replaced and the flight departed to again spray chemical.  After takeoff while flying about 200-250 feet above ground level (agl) at an indicated airspeed of 30-40 knots, with a 10-15 knot wind from the southeast, he began a left turn to line up for his spray swath.  The helicopter yawed 20-30 degrees to the right which could not be corrected with full left anti-torque pedal input.  He lowered the collective in an attempt to recover but with insufficient altitude, the helicopter collided with trees then the ground.  He further stated that there was no engine or flight control malfunction and the right yaw is a characteristic of ""loss of tail rotor effectiveness.""","The poor in-flight planning by the pilot for failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering to begin spray operations resulting in the loss of tail rotor effectiveness, subsequent in flight loss of control, and in flight collision with terrain."

The pilot requested and was cleared for the ILS Runway 27 approach.  While on final, the airplane encountered light to occasional moderate turbulence, and required a 30-40 degree drift correction to maintain course.  When the airplane was 2 miles from the runway, the tower controller reported the wind as 300 degrees at 18 knots.  The pilot continued the approach and 100 to 50 feet above the ground felt the crosswind ""dramatically"" subside.  The pilot was then able to maintain runway alignment with no wind correction.  The landing phase continued without incident until the airplane was 3-5 feet above the runway.  The pilot then felt a ""significant and abrupt"" buffeting of the airplane.  The airplane ""weather-vaned"" to the right, rolled left, and started to drift left of the centerline.  The pilot applied corrective action; however, the airplane touched down nose wheel first, bounced back into the air, and then touched down nose wheel first again.

The flight instructor said the purpose of the flight was to provide multi-engine instruction to the private pilot, and to practice short-field landings.  The private pilot completed one short-field landing, and was on final approach for the second short-field landing when the landing gear struck the leading edge of the runway, and collapsed.  He said the airplane was stabilized on the approach for landing when the flight instructor made an abrupt, nose-down input to the control yoke.  The flight instructor stated that he had ""lowered the nose"" to increase airspeed during the approach, in compensation for gusty conditions.  According to the flight instructor, the airplane encountered a downdraft in close proximity to the ground, and he was unable to take the controls and arrest the descent before the airplane struck the leading edge of the runway.

During the takeoff, the glider began an uncontrolled climb at a 45-degree nose up attitude behind the tow plane.  The tow plane pilot was forced to cut the tow rope due to the severe pitch down moment caused by the glider.  The glider then arced over into a 45-degree nose down dive and hit the ground.  The glider's flight control system was equipped with Hotalier quick disconnect fittings at various locations to facilitate the disassembly of the glider for trailer transport.  A postaccident examination of the flight control system disclosed that the elevator control push rod was disconnected from the elevator at a quick disconnect fitting in the vertical stabilizer.  There was no damage noted to the elevator bell crank or the terminal end of the elevator control push rod.  A close friend and former partner in the glider was interviewed.  He was present on the day of the accident and knew the pilot very well.  He stated that he and the pilot had purchased the glider a little less than a year prior to the accident.  The pilot had flown it over 50 times and had assembled it as many as 25 times.  On the day of the accident, he and the pilot completed a control check while qued for the tow plane.  He stated that he held the elevator while the pilot applied full up elevator control input.  He felt the elevator move in the up position.  He said neither the pilot nor he attempted to apply full nose down control input, as it was assumed the elevator was properly attached to the control rod fitting.  He stated that in retrospect, the only way to positively check the connection is to hold the elevator in the up position while the pilot applies full nose down control input.","The failure of the pilot to attach the elevator control rod to the elevator, resulting in a loss of pitch control and subsequent ground impact.  Additional factors were the failure to complete a positive control check and the lack of clear guidance in the assembly procedures."

The pilot reported that at the time he was landing, multiple runways were being used and he was sequenced between two jets.  He was dividing his time and attention between the other airplanes and his airplane.  He remembered that he rotated the landing switch to the down position, and believed the landing gear had extended.  However, when he flared to land, the propeller contacted the runway, and at that point he realized the landing gear was not down and locked. The airplane slid to a stop on the runway with the landing gear retracted.   Examination of the airplane revealed the rotary switch which initiated the electro/hydraulic extension of the landing gear was worn and it was necessary to ensure that the switch was rotated fully to make the electrical contacts necessary for landing gear extension.  A check of the warning light that illuminated with a closed throttle, and landing gear not extended, revealed it would illuminate only of the throttle was pulled forcibly to the throttle closed position.  The airplane was also equipped with a pair of red painted wires on the top of the wing which were visible when the landing gear was retracted, and not visible when the landing gear was extended.

One flight attendant in the aft galley was seriously injured and four others aboard the air carrier flight received minor injuries when the airplane encountered moderate to severe clear air turbulence in cruise at flight level 310 (FL310, 31,000 feet).  About 30 minutes before the turbulence was encountered, the company flight dispatcher communicated to the flight crew that the flight was approaching an area of forecast moderate to severe turbulence associated with mountain wave activity between FL310 and FL390 (39,000 feet).  The dispatcher recommended that the flight alter course and descend to FL280 (28,000 feet).  Eighteen minutes before the turbulence was encountered the pilot requested a ""ride report"" at FL310 from air traffic control and was told to expect ""occasional light chop, nothing real bad.""  The pilot remained at FL310 and remained on the existing routing.  Approaching the area of forecast turbulence, he illuminated the seat belt sign and advised the passengers of the potential for turbulence.  He also advised the flight attendants to stow the galley equipment.  Approximately 3 to 4 minutes later, the flight encountered turbulence.  The injured flight attendant was one of two in the aft galley.  The other flight attendant reported that when the turbulence started they were ""jolted"" a couple of times during which she recalled her feet came off the floor and then the turbulence subsided.  They ""scrambled"" toward their jumpseats; however, they encountered additional, more severe, turbulence and it became impossible to hold onto anything.  She recalled being thrown about the galley; hitting the ceiling, counters, and doors before being ""slammed"" to the floor.  When the turbulence ceased, the flight descended to flight level 280 and continued to its intended destination without further incident.  The airplane's digital flight data recorder showed the aircraft encountered three vertical acceleration excursions between 1.449 g's and -0.379 g's over a 16-second period.",The failure of the pilot-in-command to properly evaluate a hazardous weather advisory and his failure to adequately alter course and flight altitude to avoid the area of hazardous weather.

During a touch-and-go landing, the aircraft veered off the runway, encountered soft terrain, and nosed over.  No skid marks were found leading to the accident site.  The tires were examined and no flat spots were observed.  The airplane was uprighted and rolled to see if there was any resistance from the brakes.  None was noted.  The brakes were inspected and operated with no defects observed.  The wind was calm at the time of the accident.  The pilot received his private certificate on April 4, 2001, and had approximately 78 hours total time when the accident occurred.  All of the pilot's primary flight training experience was accrued in the Katana DA-20 airplane.  After obtaining his private pilot certificate, the pilot received 3.7 hours of flight instruction in the Cessna 172, and had logged an additional 2.4 hours of flight time prior to the accident.  A flight instructor from the same flight school flew with the pilot in another Cessna 172 the day after the accident.  He stated that the pilot had a tendency to land very flat, with no flare.  The instructor was experienced in both the Katana DA-20 and the Cessna 172.  He stated that the landing characteristics of the Katana require little or no flare by the pilot.  In contrast, the Cessna 172 requires a considerable amount of flare to achieve a proper touchdown attitude.  Since the pilot had received all of his primary training in a Katana, his tendency in any airplane would be to land it like a Katana.  In the event of a nose first landing, the airplane will ""wheel barrow"" and can become nearly impossible to control.  This landing condition can easily result in a rapid and uncontrollable change in direction on the runway.","The failure of the pilot-in-command to execute a proper landing flare, which resulted in an improper touchdown attitude and a subsequent loss of directional control.  A factor in the accident was the difference between landing characteristics of the Katana and the Cessna 172, and the resulting habit interference for the pilot."

Before departure, the airplane was fueled and the pilot was observed loading cargo into the airplane; the airplane held a  total of 77 gallons of fuel at the time of engine start.  The airplane rotated about the ""Delta"" intersection and approximately 1 minute 36 seconds after the controller cleared the flight to takeoff, the tower controller asked the pilot is she was experiencing any difficulty, to which she replied, ""slightly uh i may have to circle.""  The tower controller and an FAA employee both noted that the airplane was porpoising at a point approximately 6,000 feet down the 9,000 foot runway; the airplane was at between 80 and 100 feet agl.  The flight crew of a U.S. Airways flight next in line for takeoff reported that the airplane never climbed higher than approximately 300 feet agl, and began drifting to the left.  The flight continued and when near the end of the runway, a witness later reported that the engine sounded like it was operating at full throttle and the airplane was porpoising.  A witness near the accident site reported that the engine was surging and the airplane pitched nose-up, then banked to the left in about a 45-degree angle of bank.  The airplane then pitched nose down followed by impact with trees then the ground.  Witnesses near the accident site reported hearing discrepancies related to the engine immediately before the airplane pitched nose down.  Examination of the engine, and flight controls revealed no evidence of  preimpact failure or malfunction.  The forward baggage compartment was found to contain cargo that weighed a total of approximately 244 pounds; the limitation is 100 pounds.  The remaining cargo scattered throughout the airplane and/or located outside the airplane weighed a total of approximately 211 pounds.  The NTSB has not talked with the pilot nor received the NTSB report form sent to the attorney representing the pilot and airplane owner.  As a result, since the exact placement of cargo could not be determined, all cargo except that located in the forward baggage compartment was placed in the aft baggage compartment for calculation purposes.  An individual did note cargo in the aft portion of the cabin before the flight departed.  At the time of takeoff, the airplane was approximately 8 pounds under gross weight and was greater than 4 inches forward of the forward center of gravity limit.  The center of gravity moved further forward when some of the cargo that was found in the cockpit and cabin was placed in the cabin, instead of all being placed in the aft baggage compartment for calculation purposes.  Personnel from the airplane manufacturer would not comment on the flight characteristics of an airplane being operated outside the center of gravity envelope.  Analysis of voice transmissions was negative for determination of engine/propeller rpm and any of the times of communication from the pilot.  Testing of fuel from the facility that fueled the airplane indicated the fuel met specification.  The pilot had agreements with at least one individual and one company that paid her a yearly fee to transport mail to and from the Bahamas.  Additionally, the FAA reported the pilot was carrying property for compensation or hire contrary to 14 CFR Part 119.5(g).  The pilot advised an individual in the Bahamas that he did not have to speak to FAA if the FAA made an inquiry.","The pilot's exceeding the forward center of gravity (CG) ) limits at the time of engine start, the inability of the pilot to control the airplane due to the exceeded CG limits, the failure of the pilot to abort the takeoff with sufficient runway remaining, and the inadvertent stall by the pilot while maneuvering shortly after takeoff."

	According to the flight instructor, all pretakeoff checks were conducted by the instrument student, and his observation was that all preflight walk-around, radio, navigational, and engine checks were normal. Engine operation was normal, even characterized as ""smooth"" for initial power application and rotation, however, at about 200 to 300 feet agl, while crossing the departure end of the runway, the engine ""burped"" and regained power. About the time both pilots decided to return for a landing, the engine quit completely. The instructor took control of the aircraft, and they completed the emergency checklist for engine failure on takeoff, including switching fuel selector to the other, (left) tank, but power was not regained and a landing in the trees was unavoidable. Both pilots are adamant about the fuel selector being in the right tank detent at the start of the takeoff roll. Enough fuel spillage existed at the wreckage site that the Chapel Hill Fire Department was called, therefore fuel exhaustion was not considered by the FAA inspectors. Atmospheric conditions were not conducive to formation of carburetor ice by reference to icing probability charts. Subsequent engine run at an engine repair station with FAA oversight, after making adjustments for minor impact damage,  revealed a satisfactorily running engine from idle to takeoff power.","	The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons during takeoff, resulting in an inflight collision with trees during the subsequent emergency landing. A factor in the accident was the lack of suitable terrain to conduct an emergency landing."

	According to the pilot, at about 4,500 feet msl, the engine quit without warning. His emergency landing field choices were, trees, a river, or previously forested clearcut fields. He chose a small clearing surrounded by trees and he sustained a hard touchdown and noseover. FAA inspector statements revealed that fuel exhaustion, weather, or pilot human factors were not at issue. Teardown inspection of the modified fuel injection servo by NTSB and repair station personnel revealed internal separation of parts within the servo's regulator assembly which effectively shut down the fuel flow to the engine.","	A total loss of engine power during cruise flight due to an internal disconnection in the fuel injector control assembly as a result of a failure of the maintenance facility to follow proper installation procedures, resulting in a forced landing and collision with trees and the terrain."

After landing, while taxing back to the ramp area, the pilot observed a fire in the left engine.  He secured the engine and evacuated the airplane.  Examination of the engine revealed that the fuel boost pump was leaking.  At the time, the pump manufacturer had a service bulletin to inspect, and retorque if necessary, four screws that secured the  pump valve assembly.  Examination and testing of the pump at the manufacturer's facility revealed that the wrong set of four screws had been torqued.  Discussions between the pump manufacturer and airplane operator revealed that there was some ambiguity in the current service bulletin, and the maintenance personnel were confused at to which four screws the bulletin referred to.  Subsequently, the pump manufacturer revised the service bulletin.","The company maintenance personnel's failure to comply with the service bulletin, which resulted in a fuel boost pump leakage and subsequent fire during taxi.  A factor was the manufacturer's confusing service bulletin."

The pilot stated that he departed with full fuel tanks, and the fuel selector was initially positioned to the left tank.  The pilot reported that he switched fuel tanks every 15 minutes.  However, about 3 hours en route to his intended destination, the left fuel gauge displayed ""E"", and the right gauge displayed ""1/4.""  The pilot decided to divert to a closer airport, but he could not activate the pilot-controlled runway lighting.  Therefore, he continued to his original destination, and continued to select the left fuel tank.  While on approach to the intended airport, the engine lost all power, and the pilot made a forced landing into trees.  Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  The right wing had separated from the airplane, and the right fuel tank was compromised.  The left fuel tank was still intact, and the inspector found approximately 1 to 2 pints of fuel remaining in the left tank.  Additionally, the airport manager at the alternate airport reported that he tested the pilot-controlled lighting, and it functioned properly.  The pilot reported a total flight experience of 84 hours, of which, about 55 were in the make and model accident airplane.  He obtained his private pilot  certificate  about  2 months prior to the accident.","The pilot's inadequate fuel management, which resulted in fuel starvation."

The airplane was on approach to runway 28, a 3,600 foot-long, 75 foot-wide, asphalt runway.  The pilot stated he encountered a ""strong gust or shear,"" which pushed the airplane up and to the right and had almost completed the correction from the right edge of the runway to the center line, when ""the bottom dropped out.""  The airplane bounced, began to porpoise and the right wing and front propeller contacted the runway.  The airplane then veered off the right side of the runway and entered a ditch.  Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any pre-impact malfunctions; nor did the pilot report any.  The pilot obtained his multi-engine private pilot rating about 1 month prior to the accident.  The pilot reported about 1,100 hours of total flight experience, which included 25 hours of multi-engine flight experience.  Prior to the accident flight, the pilot accumulated 15 hours of flight experience in the accident airplane, all with a flight instructor.  Winds reported at an airport about 11 miles west of the accident site, were from 200 degrees at 14 knots.","The pilot's improper recovery from a bounced landing.

The pilot, holder of a student pilot certificate, was on a cross-country personal flight over remote terrain.  While in cruise flight, the engine suddenly began producing a heavy vibration.  It also began to smoke and produce oil on the windshield, and then the propeller stopped.  The airplane began to descend and the pilot turned toward a small frozen lake, located about 5 miles from a major highway.  The area around the lake was surrounded by tall trees.  The pilot selected a forced landing area between several trees in an area only large enough to fit the main fuselage.  During the collision, the windshield was broken out, the cabin doors were torn off, and the wings were extensively damage, including rupturing of the wing fuel tanks.  The cockpit area remain intact and the pilot exited the airplane with a small backpack.  A postcrash fire then erupted and the airplane was consumed.  The flight was not reported overdue, and no emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signals were detected by search and rescue personnel.  The following day, the pilot said he used a handheld radio to contact an airplane flying over the area and requested assistance.  The pilot of the other airplane landed on the small frozen lake and picked up the pilot.  Following the accident, the pilot reported that internal components of the engine failed and ruptured the engine case.",A total failure of the engine and subsequent rupture of the crankcase during cruise flight.  A factor in the accident was unsuitable terrain for a forced landing.

The commercial certificated pilot was landing on runway 29 at an airport which was an intermediate stop on a cross-country government flight.  The wind conditions were reported to the pilot as 070 degrees at 6 knots.  After touchdown, the airplane veered to the left.  The pilot applied right rudder and right brake pressure, but the airplane continued to the left.  The right wingtip and the right aileron struck the gravel-covered ground along the left side of the runway.  The wingtip was bent upward slightly, and the trailing edge of the right aileron was buckled upward.  The pilot decided the airplane was airworthy, and continued the flight to his final destination.","The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions, and inadequate weather evaluation resulting in a loss of directional control during the landing roll.  Factors in the accident were the presence of a quartering tailwind, and an inadvertent ground loop."

The airplane sustained substantial damage on impact with terrain while maneuvering.  The pilot sustained minor injury and passenger sustained serious injury.  The flight's purpose was to track weather balloons.  The pilot stated, ""On the third pass over one of these roads, I did a similar climbing turn then descending turn as I had done (and have done hundreds of times before) however, I did not carry enough power in the climbing turn.  On the descending turn portion, our descent rate was high enough that out leveling off point ended up below the ground.  At impact we were in an almost 3 pt attitude with full power, but again not in the attitude long enough to arrest descent.""",The pilot not maintaining clearance from the terrain.

The pilot stated that he performed a power-off approach to the 10th fairway but just before touchdown he elected to fly closer to the club house and pitched the nose up then added power but the engine did not respond.  A high sink rate developed resulting in a hard landing.  The gyrocopter then began to wobble resulting in main rotor blade contact with the grass fairway.  The gyrocopter then rolled over and a postcrash fire damaged one of the main rotor blades, the main rotor pitch change assembly, and the carburetor.  He further stated that there was no flight control preimpact failure or malfunction and he believes the engine quit during the approach due to ""flooding"", as it had happened before.  He also stated that he should have added power before pitching up to air taxi.",The failure of the pilot to maintain airspeed during the approach resulting in a hard landing.

Just after takeoff, the aircraft started rolling to the left. As the pilot applied right roll inputs, the aircraft accelerated its roll to the left. As it reached a bank angle of approximately 80 degrees, it descended into the runway surface. The flight was intended as a post-maintenance test flight after installation of a replacement set of wings. A post-accident inspection determined that the ailerons had been misrigged so that they deflected opposite to the inputs of the pilot. Neither the pilot nor the mechanic who accompanied him on the flight detected the aileron reversal during the walk-around inspection or the pre-takeoff flight control test.",the reverse rigging of the aileron flight control system resulting in aileron deflections opposite that of the pilot's inputs which lead to an uncontrolled descent into the terrain.

The pilot obtained three weather briefings prior to takeoff for a visual flight rules night cross-country flight.  According to the weather briefings, thunderstorms, heavy rain and hail were forecast for the destination area.  The pilot radioed a flight service station over a flight watch frequency while en route to obtain updated weather for the destination.  The pilot was informed that rain had passed through the destination airport area within the previous hour and that there were thunderstorms northwest of the airport.  The airplane disappeared from radar 13 minutes following this in-flight weather update.  The radar data depicted the airplane descending from 2,800 feet to 2,300 feet prior to disappearing from radar coverage.  The last two radar returns depicted the airplane making a turn towards the northwest.  One of the surviving passengers stated that while en route, ""the weather started getting bad.""  The airplane struck trees in hilly terrain approximately 1,675 feet msl.  No aircraft or engine anomalies were noted that would have prevented normal operations.

The airplane was in cruise flight at 3,500 feet in the vicinity of the Potomac River when the airplane experienced a partial loss of engine power.  The pilot said he checked the magnetos and engine controls, and experienced a slight restoration of power when he adjusted the mixture.  Within 3 minutes, there was a total loss of engine power.  The pilot turned away from the river, and performed a forced landing to a farm pasture.  Examination of the airplane at the scene revealed that the # 3 cylinder was loose on the crankcase, and the number 3 intake tube was not installed, and rested in the bottom of the engine compartment.  The #3 exhaust riser was found separated at the flange.  The flange was found loose, as the two nuts were not tight, with one nut having no washer or lock washer installed.  Further examination revealed the 2 case studs and 2 thru studs along the bottom of the # 3 cylinder were broken off.  The cylinder was removed and visually examined.  The cylinder skirt exhibited chafing and scratching.  There was corresponding scratching to the cylinder case pad material.  Examination of the fractured cylinder studs revealed fracture surfaces with features consistent with fatigue.  The engine was overhauled 14 years and 917 flight hours prior to the accident, and no cylinders had been removed during that time.  The engine manufacturer recommended that the engine be overhauled every 2,000 hours or 12 years, whichever occurred first.","The failure of cylinder case and thru studs due to fatigue, which resulted in a loss of engine power over unsuitable terrain."

The airplane made an off field forced landing following a loss of engine power during climb out from a touch-and-go landing.  The pilot had practiced touch-and-go landings for over an hour and experienced no difficulties with the airplane.  After a break, he completed another preflight inspection and practiced more landings.  As the airplane climbed through 200 feet on the fourth takeoff, the engine made a clunking noise and stopped producing power.  He steered the airplane to an open field and landed on soft dirt, but the airplane dug in and damaged the wings, stabilizer, landing gear, and propeller.  The engine had accumulated about 1,860 hours since it had been manufactured in 1953, and the factory had no record of it returning since that time.  The engine had accumulated about 910 hours since a field overhaul in 1960, and about 255 hours since a ""top overhaul"" in 1970, when the exhaust valves were replaced.  All cylinders were undamaged except cylinder No. 3, which exhibited extensive mechanical damage.  The exhaust valve for cylinder No. 3 fractured and separated where the valve stem transitions to the valve head.  The fracture surfaces on the valve pieces were obliterated by the mechanical damage.  The piston face exhibited mechanical damage over most of its surface, which contained two holes.

According to the pilot, he entered the landing pattern for multiple landings on Runway 35.  During the second landing, he encountered what he believed to be ""variable cross/tail wind gusts"" during landing rollout.  The airplane veered off the runway, and onto an adjacent, water-saturated turf runway.  The wheels furrowed into the turf, and the propeller and right wing struck the ground.  There were no weather reporting facilities at the airport, and the nearest airport that had reporting facilities was approximately 25 nautical miles to the southwest, and separated by mountainous terrain.  Weather, recorded at that airport about 25 minutes after the accident, included clear skies and winds from 230 degrees at 6 knots.",The pilot's loss of directional control during the landing roll.

The pilot boarded the experimental acrobatic aircraft after completion of an annual inspection, started the engine, and began to taxi from the ramp.  About half-way down the taxiway, she noticed that she was using ""a lot"" of power to taxi downwind.  During the taxi, the ""brakes seemed to be okay"" as they assisted directional control ""normally"" during turns.  The pilot then stopped and turned into the wind to see if the parking brake was engaged.  The brake handle was not ""out"" (on) so she pulled it out and tapped the brakes several times to release it.  After calling on UNICOM frequency for assistance, she started to taxi back to the hangar. Just prior to reaching the ramp, the right brake failed.  The aircraft turned left and the pilot stopped the aircraft.  As airport personnel approached the aircraft, the pilot shut down the engine and saw smoke coming from the right side of the aircraft.  She exited the aircraft and attempted to use a fire extinguisher on the wheel that was in flames.  The fire did not extinguish, so both she and the airport personnel backed away as the aircraft was consumed by the fire.  The fire damage was too extensive to discern specific anomalies with the normal and parking brake systems.",Failure of the brake system during taxi.  A contributing factor was the pilot's decision to continue taxiing after discovering the brakes were not functioning normally.

The single engine helicopter impacted trees and terrain during a forced landing following a reported loss of engine power.  According to the crew's statements, during the positioning flight back to their hospital base one of the flight nurses spotted a herd of antelope and pointed them out to the pilot.  The pilot turned toward the herd.  As he slowed down and maneuvered the helicopter to view the animals he detected the engine out audio warning and corresponding engine out warning light.  The pilot noticed the rotor rpm dropping and he looked at the engine turbine outlet temperature gauge to verify that the engine had lost power.  He added that he could no longer hear the engine.  The pilot lowered the collective at 500 feet agl, and entered an autorotation.  The pilot noticed the rotor rpm was in the low 90's at the time of autorotation entry.  The pilot selected a landing area and informed the cabin crew that this was for real and to brace themselves.  As the helicopter decelerated, the pilot rolled the throttle to the off position.  When the pilot realized that he was going to impact a tree, he pulled up on collective to cushion the landing.  The helicopter impacted the tree, then the ground, and came to rest upright in flat desert terrain covered with scrub brush.  Photographs taken at the accident site revealed open areas void of trees surrounding the landing spot.  The helicopter was examined and nothing was noted that would have precluded normal operation.  A post-accident test run of the engine revealed no anomalies during repeated accelerations and decelerations.  The engine's measured power output exceeded new engine specifications.  The engine was not equipped with an auto reignition system.","A loss of engine power due to the likely unporting of the fuel tank pickups as the helicopter was maneuvered to look at animals on the ground.  Also causal was the pilot's misjudged touchdown point during an autorotational approach, which resulted in the in-flight impact with a tree."

	According to the pilot, as a result of his preflight walk-around inspection, he felt confident that he had at least 12 gallons of fuel on board. Since his planned flight was for about 20 minutes, and knowing fuel burn is about 8.5 gallons an hour, he felt he had adequate fuel aboard. Actually, the fuel aboard was about 4 gallons, and 10 minutes into the flight, the engine quit while he was overhead a residential area of Germantown at 1500 feet msl. He reasoned that his only alternative was a forced landing to a residential street, and during the landing, the aircraft sequentially collided with an automobile rear window with the landing gear, a utility pole and mailbox with the wings, and a street sign with the horizontal stabilizer. Postcrash examination by FAA inspectors and the pilot revealed no evidence of fuel aboard.","	The pilot's failure to conduct proper preflight planning and preparation, resulting in fuel exhaustion during cruise flight, and the subsequent emergency descent and forced landing to a residential street  colliding with a vehicle, utility pole, mail box, and street sign."

During cruise flight, the horizontal stabilizer jammed in the (-1)-degree trim position.  After an uneventful landing, the elevator trim actuator was forwarded to the manufacturer for examination under the supervision of a Safety Board investigator.  The elevator trim actuator contained a primary and back-up clutch gear, and each gear had a respective torque nut and lock washer.  The examination revealed that that the tabs on the lock washers were not bent over into the locked position.  Additionally, there was no evidence that the tabs had ever been bent into the locked position.  The back-up clutch torque nut had backed off and down the shaft, coming to rest against the clutch gear cluster bearing outer race.  The backed-off nut exhibited a scratch around the outer edge of the face, consistent with fouling against the clutch gear cluster bearing outer race, subsequently jamming the unit.

Upon arrival at the destination airport, the commercial pilot of the Part 135 cargo flight reported to the tower that he was 7 miles to the east, intending to land on runway 13.  Subsequently, the pilot reported that he would circle the airport a few times ""because he was having trouble with his autopilot.""  After circling, the pilot positioned the airplane on final approach to runway 13.  The pilot of another airplane in the traffic pattern observed  the accident airplane on a ""one to two mile final, in a normal flight attitude but possibly a little low.""  After looking at her instruments for several seconds, she made visual contact again and observed the airplane impact the ground with the ""tail of the aircraft falling forward on top of a fence.""  She further stated that all of the radio transmissions from the accident airplane were ""calm and completely un-alarmed prior to the accident.""  Another witness, who was located at a fixed base operator at the airport, observed the airplane turn onto final.  He stated that the airplane ""suddenly stalled and slammed into the ground from about two hundred feet.""  The 1,140 hour pilot had accumulated a total of 70 hours in the Cessna 402.  The airplane was found to be within its prescribed weight and balance limitations at the time of the accident.  Ground impressions and airframe deformations indicated that the impact angle was approximately 25 degrees nose down on a magnetic heading of 155 degrees with the landing gear extended and the flaps partially extended.  A post-impact fire destroyed the airplane.  Flight control continuity was established from the aft section of the cockpit to the rudder and elevator flight control surfaces.  The elevator trim tab (located on the right elevator) was measured with a protractor and found to be in the 28 degrees tab-up position (aircraft nose down).  According to the airplane manufacturer's specifications, the maximum tab-up travel limit (when connected) is 5 degrees.  The trim tab would not move freely by hand forces and appeared to be jammed.  The elevator skin was cut open (top side) to observe the trim tab connecting hardware.  It was observed that the clevis end of the trim tab actuator rod was wedged against the front spar of the elevator's internal structure.  Additionally, the bolt which connected the clevis end of the tab actuator rod to the actuator screw, was missing.  After further inspection, neither the bolt nor the nut were found in the cavity of the elevator structure or the surrounding area.  The clevis end of the actuator rod and the actuator screw were not damaged, and no impact damage was apparent on the trim tab.  The operator's maintenance records showed that the right elevator had been replaced 10 flight hours prior to the accident.","the loss of control due to a jammed trim tab, which resulted from the failure of maintenance personnel to properly secure the trim tab actuator rod when installing a replacement elevator."

The pilot said the preflight, engine start, run-up, taxi and takeoff were ""normal"".  The pilot said that during the climb after takeoff, approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the ground, the airplane's engine ""spooled down, slowly and smoothly, like a loss of torque or the propeller going to feather.""  The pilot performed a forced landing to a field, where the airplane nosed over, and came to rest inverted.  Examination of the engine and propeller revealed that the propeller-reversing lever was installed on the wrong side of the reversing lever guide pin, and that the reversing linkage carbon block was no longer installed, and had departed the airplane.  Examination of the airplane's maintenance records revealed that the carbon block was replaced during a 100-hour maintenance inspection, 5 hours prior to the accident.  Installation of the reversing lever on the incorrect side of the guide pin resulted in improper seating and premature wear of the carbon block.  According to the engine manufacturer, any disconnection in operation of the propeller control linkage will cause the propeller governor beta control valve to extend, and drive the propeller into feather.","The incorrect installation of the propeller reversing lever and carbon block assembly, which resulted in a loss of propeller thrust."

According to the pilot, the freighter flight was normal in all aspects until the landing gear were extended for landing at destination. The left main landing gear, (LMLG) indicated ""unsafe"", and all attempts, using the emergency/abnormal checklists and telephone/radio-relayed communications with company maintenance, failed to extend it.  An emergency, LMLG retracted landing was performed with minimal damage to the aircraft. Postcrash investigation revealed that company maintenance installed a one-way check valve in the LMLG extend hydraulic lines instead of a restricted flow valve. The wrongly installed valve had no factory specification or part number attached, and the tag reportedly removed from it at installation possessed the wrong factory specification number, and the correct vendor' s part number. The company maintenance manual states that upon completion of the valve installation, a leak and operational test of the MLG retract/extension system be performed. The valve installation mechanic and the company inspector both stated that the finished job was leak and ""ops"" tested.","The failure of company maintenance personnel to install the correct hydraulic landing gear extension component, and the failure of company maintenance inspection personnel to comply with proper post maintenance test procedures, resulting in the impossibility of the LMLG to extend, and the subsequent LMLG up landing.

The first two legs were uneventful.  The pilot stated that the flight departed on the third leg and approximately 15 minutes into the flight, he noted a problem with the airplane's radios.  He attempted to troubleshoot the radio problem and checked the ammeter which indicated a slight discharge.  He turned on all the aircraft's lights to see if the ammeter would change; it did not.  He then secured all electrical equipment with the exception of the No. 1 communication transceiver and transponder.  He checked the circuit breakers and reset the alternator switch; with negative results.  He was cleared to land via a light signal from the tower and lowered the landing gear electrically.  He reported hearing the landing gear motor operate, felt a sensation that he equated to was the landing gear locking into position, and looked out and thought that the main landing gear were locked into position; he could not see the gear down and locked light due to sunlight.  After touchdown, the main landing gear collapsed; the nose landing gear did not collapse.  Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the ""A+"" electrical cable which is connected to the alternator and a terminal block on the firewall was separated from the wire connector at the terminal block on the firewall.  Further examination determined that the cable was locally manufactured and appeared to be too short which did not allow for vibration.",The pilot's delay in securing all non-essential electrical equipment in-flight resulting in battery depletion before complete gear extension was accomplished using the normal system and subsequent collapse of the main landing gear.  A contributing factor in the accident was the inadequate manufacture of an electrical cable by company maintenance personnel resulting in separation of one end of the cable in-flight.

The pilot departed on runway 16, which is located on a narrow mesa (the surrounding terrain is 300 to 350 feet  below).  He said that immediately after takeoff, he experienced a loss of power on the right engine.  The pilot feathered the propeller on the left engine and performed a forced landing.   He had raised the landing gear with runway left to land on.  The FAA Advisory Circular 61-21A, Flight Training Handbook states that the landing gear should not be raised until a safe landing can no longer be made on the remaining portion of the runway.  Postaccident examination of both engines revealed no mechanical anomalies which might have affected their performance.  Recovery personnel reported that both propellers were ""dramatically"" bent in the opposite direction of rotation.  Additionally they found that the right wing root fuel sump valve was installed improperly, and was impossible to sump.  When they removed the valve, they found that the fuel sample was approximately 25% water.  The wind, at the time of the attempted takeoff, was 130 degrees at 21 gusting to 31 knots.  The direct crosswind was calculated to be 16 knots, which was within the airplane's demonstrated crosswind limit of 20 knots.","the pilot's failure to sump all the fuel drains during preflight and the subsequent loss of power in the right engine during takeoff, the pilot feathering the wrong engine's propeller during the forced landing, the pilot improperly raising the landing gear with usable runway in front of him, and lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.  Contributing factors were the water in the fuel, the terrain induced turbulent cross wind condition, and the mountainous/hilly terrain for the forced landing."

After the Piper Malibu Meridian touched down on the runway, it started to veer right.  Rudder control inputs were ineffective, and the airplane continued off the right side of the runway.  With the airplane heading toward hangars and bystanders, the pilot elected to abort the landing.  He applied full power, and the airplane began to turn back toward the runway.  The airplane drug its left wing along an embankment, continued onto the departure end of the runway and struck a  runway end identifier light.  The airplane crossed a road, struck a fence, small trees, and continued over uneven terrain collapsing the landing gear before coming to a stop.  No pre-impact anomalies with the aircraft were identified during the post-accident examination.  The aircraft manufacturer conducted numerous taxi and flight tests in an attempt to duplicate what the pilot reported.  Tests consisted of normal and crosswind takeoffs and landings, high-speed taxi testing, and landing and taxi tests using ""abnormal, abusive nose steering techniques.""

	Within 3 miles of landing, as the pilot was completing his before landing check list, the engine surged to 2,700 rpm two or three times, and then stopped developing power, completely. The pilot thought his best alternative was a forced landing to a corn field, which was accomplished but the airframe sustained substantial damage. Post crash examination by FAA inspectors revealed adequate fuel was aboard. Examination of engine, fuel, ignition, and airframe components revealed the fuel selector cover assembly was loose, missing mounting screws, and had shifted aft of its designed position. Such a repositioning would render the mechanical safety stop that would prevent an inadvertent switch to ""off"" inoperative. A search of the aircraft maintenance logs revealed an entry where the aircraft seats, door panels, plastic, and carpeting were removed for replacement or cleaning.","	A total loss of engine power due to the failure of maintenance to properly secure the fuel selector cover, resulting in the pilot inadvertently selecting ""off"" instead of ""left"" tank, and the subsequent forced landing to uneven terrain."

He practiced flight maneuvers and three wheel landings at a nearby dry lake bed and then landed at Jean, Nevada, airport for a 20-minute rest stop.  He did not fuel the aircraft at Jean airport, which had fuel service available.  He stated that during his return to Henderson, the engine slowed down and stopped approximately 3 miles from the airport.  He attempted a restart.  The engine restarted and ran for about 1 minute and stopped again, resulting in a forced landing 1 mile short of the airport in rough desert terrain.  He stated that the accident happened at 1400.  This would indicate a flight time of 1 hour 10 minutes.  According to the owner's manual for the airplane, the maximum fuel consumption at sea level with the mixture leaned is 12.5 gallons per hour.  At a cruise altitude of 5,000 feet with mixture leaned, the fuel consumption is 9.6 gallons per hour.  The airplane holds 42 gallons of fuel in two wing tanks.  The useable fuel is 37 gallons.  This leaves approximately 2.5 gallons of unusable fuel in each wing tank, which would result in 13 gallons available when the airplane initially departed.","The failure of the pilot to refuel the airplane, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a forced landing in rough terrain."

Once over the runway, the pilot identified that the windsock was ""slightly moving,"" so he elected to land on runway 03, which was 1,700 feet long and 60 feet wide.  With the flaps set to 30 degrees, the pilot slowed the airplane to 65-70 knots in preparation for a soft field landing.  Once over the runway, the pilot flared the airplane.  While the pilot was waiting for the airplane to settle onto the runway, it ""lurched"" to the left.  The pilot applied right rudder, but the airplane continued to the left.  The airplane departed the runway and came to a stop after impacting some small trees.  The pilot reported a total of 57.4 hours of flight experience, all of which was in the accident airplane.  In addition, it was the pilot's first attempt at making an actual soft field landing.  He had practiced soft field landings on hard surface runways, but had never actually landed on a soft surface.  Examination of the airplane revealed no pre impact failures or malfunctions.",The pilot's failure to maintain runway alignment during landing.  A factor in the accident was the pilot's lack of experience in conducting soft field landings.

The pilot planned a direct flight from Leesburg, Virginia, to Pittsfield, Pennsylvania, which would have required a course of 344 degrees magnetic.  Examination of radar data revealed the airplane initiated the flight on an approximate ground track of 340 degrees, and continued on that track for about 15 minutes.  During the next hour, the airplane performed three consecutive left-hand orbits and then rolled out on a ground track of 240 degrees.  The airplane flew for about an hour on that track, and the last radar identification was about 5 miles from the accident site.  Examination of the airplane and engine revealed no mechanical deficiencies.  According to a friend of the pilot's, the pilot had a history of ""passing out,"" with no particular reason or trigger identified.  She stated that the pilot had passed out three times in the 2 weeks prior to the accident, and once the day before the accident.  The pilot's doctor reported that the pilot had undergone extensive testing to determine a cause for his recurring loss of consciousness.  During the testing process, the pilot was instructed not to fly his airplane, until a cause could be identified for the episodes.  Four months prior to the accident, the pilot was diagnosed with ""vascular syncope,"" a nervous system reaction in which the heart rate and blood pressure drop for no reason.  On his last FAA medical application, dated three months prior to the accident, the pilot stated he had never experienced dizziness or fainting spells, unconsciousness, or high blood pressure.  A review of every FAA medical application on file for the pilot revealed he never reported any health problems.","The pilot's loss of consciousness due to a medical condition, which resulted in his failure to maintain control of the airplane and subsequent impact with rising terrain."

The airplane was making a precautionary landing due to a fluid leak (most likely fuel) in the cockpit and had an explosive flash fire in the cabin during the landing roll.  The pilot stated that a clear fluid was running down the cabin side of the firewall from an area right of center.  The right seat passenger reported that the leak appeared to be coming from behind the instrument panel directly in front of her position.  The pilot then pulled back the power slowly and headed for the closest airport.  A passenger and the ground witnesses described the touchdown and rollout as normal until an explosion occurred, which filled the cabin with flames and blew the entry door off the right side of the airplane.  Witnesses on the ground reported seeing flames coming out of the front-bottom of the aircraft before hearing a ""pop"" in conjunction with the explosion inside the cockpit.  The fabric-over-tubular-steel-frame airframe was thermally destroyed except for the steel components.  An examination of the thermal damage patterns disclosed that the most extensive thermal damage appeared to be forward of the right front seat where the passenger reported the fluid leak.  Also parts of the metal frame were severely warped, especially on the lower right-hand side near the firewall and below where the instrument panel would be.  In addition the bottom braces of the engine mount were warped due thermal damage.  Furthermore, there was sooting and heat resultant discoloration on the firewall in the engine compartment.  On the topside and on the right-hand side of the firewall red and black discoloration without sooting was evident.  The color on the right side of the firewall was a mixture of black and tan, with a little red.  On the bottom part of the firewall there was minimal sooting and a tan color.  The only flammable fluid lines on the right quadrant of the firewall are the pressure measurement lines for fuel, engine oil, and hydraulics.  These Mil-6000 hose lines are connected to firewall and pass-through fittings, that are located almost directly in front of the right seat passenger's location on the upper part of the firewall.  On the cabin side of the firewall, three other Mil-6000 hoses connect these fittings to a ""3-in-1"" instrument panel gage that displays the operating pressure of these three systems.  No evidence was found in the maintenance records that these fuel lines had ever been replaced.  While the fuel related components (i.e. carburetor, fuel pump, and associated lines) attached to the engine were thermally damaged, the degree of damage was significantly less than the fuel components attached to the firewall.  The thermal damage and sooting patterns indicate that an accelerant based fire originated on both sides of the firewall near the bottom.",A fuel leak on the cabin and engine sides of the firewall with a probable origin at the firewall pass-through fitting for the fuel pressure gage line.  The fire likely began on the engine side of the firewall near the bottom with the explosive ignition of the pooled fuel/vapors in the cockpit after burn through penetration of the fuselage fabric skin on the bottom aft side of the firewall.  Further refinement of the leak source between the pass-through fitting and the lines/connectors could not be established due to thermal destruction of the components.

The pilot stated that on the day of the accident, he flew between 5-6 hours, but estimated an endurance of 7 hours based on full tanks at the economy cruise setting.  During his fourth flight of the day, the engine lost all power.  The pilot told the passenger that he thought he was out of fuel, and performed a forced landing into a cornfield.  The pilot added that before he departed on his first flight of the day, he instructed the fixed based operator to completely fuel the airplane.  Subsequently, during the preflight inspection, both tanks appeared to be full.  However, the manager of the fixed based operator stated that prior to the accident pilot arriving at the airport, the airplane was flown 1.2 hours by a different pilot.  After that flight, the airplane was not refueled before the accident pilot departed.  The manager believed the accident pilot departed with 76 gallons of fuel, instead of the 88-gallon useable capacity.","The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection of the aircraft, which resulted in fuel exhaustion during cruise flight."

The pilot reported that shortly after takeoff, he leveled the aircraft about 150 to 200 feet AGL and adjusted the power for cruise.  The pilot noted that the fuel lever did not appear to be in its usual position, and he applied pressure to the lever to confirm that it was against the stop.  Shortly after application of this pressure, the engine quit.  Due to the low altitude, the pilot did not attempt a restart.  The pilot initiated a forced landing to an open field.  During the landing roll, the airplane collided with a mound of downed trees and nosed over.  During the airframe and engine inspection, no mechanical failures or malfunctions were noted.  The fuel control unit was removed and tested.  The FCU performance was nominal and within field adjustment limits.  The unit was held in a maximum fuel flow condition for a five minute period.  No decay of fuel flow was observed.  The fuel control reacted to speed, P3 air pressure and power lever test inputs.",Loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.  Trees were a factor.

The left seat pilot, who was undergoing training, accompanied by the right seat pilot (both pilots were instructors), taxied the floatplane out for departure.  The aircraft was turned into the wind and takeoff power was beginning to be applied when the aircraft's right wing was picked up by a wind gust.  The aircraft momentarily became airborne, pivoted and impacted the water slowly nosing over.  A cold front was passing through the Puget Sound area shortly before the accident and strong, gusty winds out of the south were recorded at all Puget Sound stations in the area near the time of the accident.  The pilot reported that the wind at the time of the accident was from 150 degrees at 25 knots with gusts to 43 knots.",The high wind conditions encountered as the aircraft began its takeoff roll.  Contributing factors were the variable and gusty wind conditions.

The airplane was substantially damaged when it was struck by an aircraft tug during passenger boarding.  The aircraft was parked and was being prepared for departure. The driver of the tug was moving the vehicle into position in order to connect the aircraft tow bar in preparation for pushback.  He said that when he placed the tug into gear, it lurched forward into the parked aircraft.  He said that pieces of the aircraft protruded through the windshield of the vehicle and pinned him into his seat.  He said that he was unable to shift the vehicle into reverse and his leg was pinned on the accelerator pedal.  Other ground workers in the area attempted to shut off the tug's engine.  The driver said that the vehicle continued to drive forward until the engine was finally shut off.  During the event, the pilot of the aircraft had applied the brakes when he noticed the unplanned movement of the airplane.  The aircraft was pushed backward about 30 feet causing damage to the nose section of the fuselage. Subsequent to the accident, the tug was placed on jacks and a check performed.  During the check it was found that the normal engine shutoff switch would not shut the engine off if the engine was operated at high throttle settings.  It was further discovered that at high throttle settings, the brake system was not able to stop the rotation of the drive wheels.  No anomalies were found during this test that would explain the lurching described by the tug driver.  The tug had been involved in a previous incident where an aircraft was damaged.  A report of the previous incident showed that the tug lurched when the driver was attempting to move the tug into position to connect to the aircraft. The tug manufacturer does not have records of operational problems associated with that model tug.  The manufacturer also said that they were not aware of a history of lurching problems concerning the model tug in question.  It was found that the distance from the cab of the tug to the nose of a DC-9 aircraft when the tow bar is attached is 4 feet 2 inches.",The partial failure of the aircraft tug for undetermined reasons.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the planned cross-country flight for which the pilot obtained a weather briefing, filed an IFR flight plan, and received an ATC clearance.  Approximately 8 minutes after takeoff, radar indicated the airplane was at 11,200 feet msl, heading 241 degrees, with a ground speed of 180 knots.  No distress calls or additional communications with the pilot were recorded, and radar contact was lost.  The airplane impacted the ground in an uncontrolled descent.  The right wing tip tank separated from the airplane and was found 0.18 nautical miles from the main wreckage.  The teardown and examination of both engines disclosed that the type and degree of damage was indicative of engine power section rotation and operation at the time of impact.  There were no complete systems intact at the accident site due to the impact sequence and post-impact fire which consumed the aircraft.  The landing gear and flaps were found in the retracted position.  The portion of the right propeller shaft coupling found at the site was fractured through 360 degrees.  Metallurgical examination revealed that the propeller shaft coupling failed in fatigue.  The presence of the fatigue cracks indicated the coupler fractured in fatigue in service, and the fatigue cracks were not the result of ground impact.  The circumferential fracture intersected the ends of several internal spline teeth.  The origin of the fatigue crack could not be determined because of severe corrosion damage on the fracture surface.  Fatigue propagation was in the aft direction and from the inside to the outside of the coupling.  The engine core rotating components would have bee free to rotate when uncoupled from the propeller shaft.  The maintenance records indicated that the failed coupling had accumulated approximately 4,000 hours since new, and 1,250 hours since engine overhaul in 1989.  Since 1990, as a result of fatigue fractures, the manufacturer introduced several design changes for the propeller shaft coupling via optional Service Bulletins to be accomplished at the next access or hot section inspection (HSI).  Impact and thermal damage of the right propeller precluded a determination of the in-flight blade angles.  The calculations by the airplane manufacturer indicated that ""the [intact] airplane was capable of continued flight"" with the right propeller feathered, and that the ""airplane can keep attitude, but cannot climb and cannot maintain altitude"" with the right propeller in the flat pitch or wind milling positions, respectively.  Metallurgical examination of the component brackets and associated bolts from the right tip tank revealed the separation of the tip tank resulted from a single-event overstress fracture of both the forward and aft tank attachment fittings.  Calculations showed that a 3.763 radians per second (35.9 RPM) spin rate would cause the failure of the forward wing fuel tank attachment fitting.  There had not been a previous in-flight separation of a wing tip fuel tank on this model airplane.","The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control following a loss of right engine power, which resulted in impact with terrain in an uncontrolled descent.  A contributing factor was the loss of right engine power as a result of the fatigue failure of the propeller shaft coupling."

The pilot reported that during the landing roll, the aircraft began to veer to the left.  When aileron and rudder control were not effective to re-align the aircraft's direction of travel, the pilot transferred over to the nose wheel steering control.  The pilot applied corrective input all the way to the right when he heard a ""clink"" sound.  The aircraft exited the side of the runway and collided with the terrain.  Post-accident inspection of the aircraft found that the nose wheel steering cable was broken.  The cable was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory for examination.  The specialist reported that the end of many wires exhibited fractures on a flat plane that was perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, typical of a fatigue crack.  About 90 percent of the flat areas extended through the fracture face.  The metallurgist reported that approximately 50 percent of the wires from the cable contained fatigue cracking.",Fatigue failure of the nose wheel steering cable during the landing roll.  Rough/uneven terrain was a factor.

While in cruise flight, the airplane encountered icing conditions. The pilot contacted ARTCC and requested various altitudes to avoid further icing. However, the airplane was unable to maintain altitude, and the pilot requested vectors to the nearest airport. Approach control cleared him to intercept the ILS. At approximately 15 feet above the ground, he flared and the airplane ""dropped hard onto the runway."" As he added power, the airplane drifted to the left and struck a runway and a taxiway light. The pilot stated that he was able to taxi the airplane back onto the runway and then park it on the ramp. An initial inspection of the airplane revealed that it had an accumulation of ice on the leading edges of both wings, that in some places was up to as much as 2 and 1/2 inches thick.",the pilot's failure to maintain the proper decent rate during the flare resulting in a hard landing.

While in cruise flight, the pilot reported that a ""slight vibration became noticeable.""  After a few minutes, the vibration became more pronounced, and was accompanied by a noise.  During an attempted precautionary landing to an offshore platform, the vibration and noise level increased again, and total engine power was lost.  The pilot then initiated an autorotation to the water, deployed the skid floats, and landed safely.  While the helicopter was being towed in the water, the helicopter rolled inverted.  Examination of the helicopter after recovery revealed that the KAflex engine-to-transmission driveshaft was fractured, and the forward tail rotor driveshaft segment was separated.  Examination of the KAflex driveshaft revealed fatigue fractures that originated from a bolt hole in the first flex frame of the coupling at the transmission end of the shaft and fatigue fractures in the end fitting at the transmission end.  The primary fracture was a fatigue crack that occurred in a bolt hole where a bolt joined the first flex frame to the center flex frame.  The driveshaft was determined to be manufactured within engineering specifications.  The fractured tail rotor driveshaft showed evidence of torsional overstress.  The KAflex driveshaft coupling had a total time of 2,114.2 hours and an airworthiness life limit of 5,000 hours.

As the flight approached the destination airport, the airplane was cruising about 1,500 feet.  About 4 miles from the airport, the engine lost power, and the pilot headed for an ultralight landing strip, located adjacent to the main destination runway.  The runway surface was occupied by vehicles and pedestrians and the pilot began a turn to the left.  About 20 feet above the ground, the airplane stalled and descended to the ground in a nose down attitude.  The fuel selector was found on the left tank.  The left fuel tank did not contain any fuel.  The right fuel tank contained a small amount of fuel.  The pilot said he always leaves the fuel tank selector on ""BOTH"" but the selector must have inadvertently been moved during the flight.  During the emergency, the pilot said he did not check the position of the fuel selector.","The pilot's failure to refuel the airplane, and subsequent fuel exhaustion.  A factor in the accident was an inadvertent stall during an emergency descent/landing."

The airplane nosed over during the water landing with the wheel extended.  The pilot reported that after takeoff from the lake, he was unable to lower the landing gear in preparation for a hard surface landing.  He returned to the lake where he recylced the gear and performed emergency procedures to verify the gear was retracted.  The pilot reported that he thought the gear was retracted prior to touchdown.   He reported that as he slowed the airplane, the force of the water pulled the landing gear down and the airplane nosed over.  Inspection of the airplane after the accident revealed that the hydraulic line to the left gear had separated porting the hydraulic fluid.  It was determined that the hydraulic line was not properly flared at the fitting.",the improper installation of the left landing gear hydraulic line which allowed it to separate and port the hydraulic fluid.  This resulted in the landing gear extending during a water landing.

The pilot obtained a weather briefing, filed an IFR flight plan, and departed on a non-scheduled domestic cargo flight, carrying 270 pounds of freight. The flight proceeded uneventfully until it was established on the VOR/DME-C approach. Radar data indicates that after turning inbound towards the VORTAC from the DME arc, the airplane began its descent from 10,600 feet to the VOR crossing altitude of 9,200 feet. Enlargement of the radar track showed the airplane correcting slightly to the left as it proceeded inbound to the VORTAC at 9,400 feet. Shortly thereafter, aircraft track and altitude deviated 0.75 miles northwest and 9,700 feet, 0.5 miles southeast and 9,600 feet, and 0.5 miles northwest and 9,400 feet before disappearing from radar. Witnesses said the weather at the time of the accident was 600 foot overcast, 1.5 miles visibility in ""misting"" rain that became ""almost slushy on the ground,"" and a temperature of 36 degrees Fahrenheit. One weather study indicated ""an icing potential greater than 50% and visible moisture"" in the accident area. Another report said ""icing conditions were likely present in the area of the accident."" The airplane was equipped and certified for flight into known icing conditions. The wreckage was found in a closely area. There was no evidence of pre-impact airframe, engine, or propeller malfunction/failure. The pilot was properly certificated, but his flight time in aircraft make/model was only 38 hours. He had previously recorded 16 icing encounters, totaling 11.2 hours in actual meteorological conditions. He recorded no ice encounters and only 1.0 hour of simulated (hooded) instrument time in the Cessna 208. Microscopic examination of annunciator light bulbs revealed the GENERATOR OFF light was illuminated. This condition indicates a generator disconnection due to a line surge, tripped circuit breaker, or inadvertent switch operation. The operator's chief pilot agreed, noting that one of the items on the Before Landing Checklist requires the IGNITION SWITCH be placed in the ON position. The START SWITCH is located next to the IGNITION SWITCH. Inadvertently moving the START SWITCH to the ON position would cause the generator to disconnect and the GENERATOR OFF annunciator light to illuminate. He said this would be distracting to the pilot.","an inadvertent stall during an instrument approach, which resulted in a loss of control. Contributing factors were the pilot's attention being diverted by an abnormal indication, conditions conducive to airframe icing, and the pilot's lack of total experience in the type of operation (icing conditions) in aircraft make/model."

While maneuvering to land after experiencing a loss of engine power the right wing dug into the soft dirt and the airplane came to rest inverted.  Three weeks prior to this accident the airplane was involved in an incident where it came to rest on its nose with the fuel tank remaining partially submerged in water.  Efforts were made to clear the water out the fuel system; however, the header tank that sits in the forward portion of the airplane was not removed and flushed properly.  The airplane had been ground run after the incident, but not flown until the day of the accident.  No mechanical anomalies were noted during the ground runs.  During the engine examination trace amounts of water were found in the carburetor.","Failure of the pilot to properly flush out the fuel system after the header tank became submerged in water, which precipitated a loss of engine power and forced landing in a soft open dirt area."

On the landing rollout, the airplane veered to the right, departed the runway, and collided with a ditch.  The purpose of the flight was to conduct three takeoffs and landings for currency.  The accident landing was the first landing of the day.  On the landing rollout the airplane went to the left and the pilot corrected back to runway centerline.  The airplane then moved to the right of centerline.  The pilot attempted to correct back to runway centerline with left rudder input and then left brake; however, the airplane continued to the right and into a ditch.  A postaccident examination of the nose wheel and steering assembly revealed excessive play or wear that may have reduced steering control.",Failure of the pilot to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll.

On touchdown the airplane was struck by a gust of wind.  The CFI aborted the landing and the airplane struck taxiway signs, traveled through a ditch and came to rest on the opposite side of the ditch on it's landing gear.  The purpose of the flight was to provide transition training for the front seat pilot who had recently purchased a similiar airplane.  The CFI reported that the previous landings had been on runway 21L, and that the front seat pilot had not done as well as the CFI had hoped.  Prior to the accident landing, the local controller switched the active runway to 30 due to a change of wind direction.  Reported METAR winds at PRC were from 350 degrees at 9 knots gusting to 18 knots.  The CFI was flying the airplane on the accident landing.  The airplane touched down in a slight crab.  Before the CFI could straighten the airplane it departed the runway.

As the helicopter cleared trees after patient pickup, a series of ""pops"" was heard and the #1 engine lost power.  The pilot initially decided to make an emergency landing in a field, but no suitable landing areas were found, and the helicopter's #2 engine was determined to be producing sufficient power to sustain flight.  The pilot therefore elected to continue the flight to the airport, and called the Medford tower and requested an emergency landing with fire crews standing by.  The medical crew on board the helicopter subsequently reported that they smelled ""something burning.""   Approaching the airport, the Medford tower controller advised the pilot that the aircraft was trailing smoke, and subsequently advised the pilot that the helicopter was on fire.   The pilot elected to make a fast run-on landing, and subsequently landed on taxiway A at the airport.  The aircraft occupants evacuated the helicopter without injury, and ARFF successfully extinguished the fire.  The fire extensively damaged the helicopter's #1 engine compartment, engine cowling, outer surfaces of the #1 engine, and transmission compartment.  The fire also partially burned/melted through the main rotor flight control tubes, and molten metal and debris were ingested into the #1 engine compressor.  Post-accident examinations disclosed that the fire occurred in the #1 engine compartment, external to the #1 engine.  The #1 engine compartment contained puddles of oil on the pan below the engine, and the #1 engine oil tank was found to be empty.  The #1 engine oil out line (a line carrying oil from the engine accessory gearbox to the oil tank) was found to be leaking at a B-nut fitting at one end of the line.  Additionally, the engine's right exhaust stack and right exhaust extension were found to be cracked around portions of their circumference under a V-clamp.  Disassembly examination of the #1 engine N1 gas producer turbine assembly at the engine manufacturer's facilities disclosed that the first-stage nozzle and turbine wheel were burned consistent with exposure to excessive TOT, and that the second-stage nozzle and turbine wheel were generally intact.  Examination of the three main bearings located in the turbine assembly (Nos. 6, 7, and 8) disclosed that the number 8 bearing was oiled and rotated freely, the number 6 bearing was dry but intact and rotated freely, and that the number 7 bearing was dry and slightly notchy but was able to be rotated.  The Rolls-Royce accident investigation report concluded that ""There were no hardware failures on any part of the engine"", that ""The damages to the 1st stage nozzle and 1st stage turbine wheel were the result of operation at an excessive TOT"", and that ""The engine was operating with the external fire well advanced as evidenced by the ingestion of fire debris and molten metal into the compressor.""","A leaking engine oil outlet line fitting in the #1 engine compartment, resulting in an oil fire in the engine compartment."

During the landing roll on a remote backcountry strip surrounded by rising terrain, the aircraft encountered a gust of wind just after touchdown.  The aircraft was picked up then dropped back to the surface.  The pilot opted to continue the landing instead of going around.  Due to insufficient room to stop before running off the airstrip, the pilot intentionally tried to ground loop the aircraft.  The nose gear collapsed and the aircraft nosed over.   The pilot reported the winds were gusting to in excess of 20 knots.",The pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions.  Wind gusts were a factor.

The airplane was observed flying low in the vicinity of the Wichita International Raceway, Wichita, Kansas.  One witness reported hearing two blasts like a shotgun.  The witness said he and his friends drove over to where they thought the sound had come from.  They found the airplane lying on the guard rail of the racetrack totally on fire.  Another witness working in his yard just north of the racetrack said he heard the sound of a small airplane, stopped what he was doing and searched to gain sight of the airplane.  He said that he had a clear view of the airplane.  It was traveling north-northwest at an altitude of 150 to 200 feet and descending slightly.  The witness said the engine speed was very high, but sounded normal, and the flaps were up.  The witness watched the airplane until he lost sight of it behind some trees.  ""About the time I lost visual contact … I heard the metallic sound and noticed that all the power wires (east and west) were bouncing.""  The witness said he ran into the house to call 9-1-1, but the phones were dead and there was no power to the house.  An examination of the accident site revealed damage to a tower support cable pole atop a 110-foot tall power line support tower.  The north side 3/4-inch diameter support cable was observed draped through trees northeast of the tower and ran north-northeast to the airplane main wreckage.  The cable ran through the airplane's empennage and on to the racetrack.  One broken end of the cable was on the racetrack south of the airplane.  The top 8 inches of the airplane's vertical stabilizer and rudder was located 15 feet east of the racetrack beneath the power lines.  A 3/4-inch diameter c-shaped indention ran horizontally along the right side of the piece.  An examination of the remainder of the airplane revealed no anomalies.  The airplane's owner said that flight instructors were using the racetrack as a practice strip to set up and practice emergency landings.",the student pilot not maintaining clearance from the tower support wire during the practice emergency landing maneuver and the instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the student pilot.

The airplane was destroyed during an in-flight collision with the terrain and subsequent explosion/post-impact fire.  A witness to the accident reported the airplane started the takeoff roll at the beginning of runway 09 and appeared to be accelerating slower than normal.  The witness reported, ""The takeoff roll looked normal ... but the aircraft seem to roll out longer than normal for this type of aircraft ... this aircraft seemed to roll about 3,500 feet before rotation.  After rotation the aircraft pitched up and down several cycles then settled down.  But after the pitch cycles stopped the plane was not climbing.  The landing gear was not cycled up it remained down.  The plane was about 200 feet altitude when the up, down pitching began again.  I noted the plane climbed about another 50 ft. Then the plane rolled to the left and entered a vertical position and impacted the ground about 1,000 ft. north of the runway centerline.  Aircraft exploded on impact.""  The pilot had logged two flights in the accident airplane, accumulating 1.2 hours.  Excluding the two previous flights in the accident airplane, the pilot did not have any other flight time in the same model as the accident airplane.  No anomalies were found that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.",The pilot not maintaining aircraft control during the initial climb after takeoff and the inadvertent stall/spin.

The pilot departed his home airport for a 90 mile personal flight with eight passengers.  The pilot stated he departed with 24 gallons of fuel in the outboard tanks, and 80 gallons of fuel in the main tanks.  After landing, the airplane was refueled with 100 low-lead aviation gasoline; 12 gallons in each main fuel tank.  Before departing for the return flight, the pilot performed a preflight inspection of the airplane, which did not include a  visual check of the airplane's fuel tanks.  After takeoff, the pilot experienced a ""small surge in both engines,"" while climbing through 1,150 and 3,300 feet, respectively.  He further described the surges as ""minor but still noticeable.""  About 30 minutes later, after the airplane had descended, and was leveling at 1,500 feet, the pilot experienced an intermittent illumination of the ""right aux fuel pump light,"" which was followed by a total loss of power on the right engine.  Shortly thereafter, the left engine began ""surging,"" and after about ""three or four minutes, at most,"" he feathered the left engine propeller.  The pilot ditched the airplane in Massachusetts Bay.  The airplane was recovered about 1 month later.  The fuel selectors were positioned to the outboard tanks, and the airplane's fuel tanks revealed fluid consistent with seawater with ""some odor of fuel;"" however, no visible evidence of fuel was observed.  According to the airplane's information manual, the airplane's total fuel capacity was 192 gallons, of which, 182 gallons were usable.  Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal evidence of any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  The pilot reported he had purchased the airplane and attended 5-day type specific training course in March 2001.  He reported about 1,050 hours of total fight experience, which included 800 hours in multi-engine airplanes, of which 65 hours was in the make and model.  Additionally, the pilot reported he had not experienced any prior mechanical problems.  He believed he had flown the airplane the day prior to the accident as well.  The last documented refueling of the airplane prior to the date of the accident occurred on May 3, 2001, when the airplane was refueled with 128 gallons of aviation gasoline.  The last flight documented in the pilot's logbook was on May 4, 2001, when the pilot logged 1.9 hours in the accident airplane.  The pilot said he normally flew a 65 percent power, an ""a little rich,"" and experienced a fuel burn of about 20 to 21 gallons per hour, for each engine.",A loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion for undetermined reasons.

According to the student pilot, he was practicing ground reference maneuvers over and around Lake Mathews.  He said he was finishing up a few power on and power off stalls, when he thought he would practice a couple of emergency landings.  He said he was familar with the procedure and had practiced them several times with no problems.  The first attempt was sucessful.  However, on the second attempt, he began his climb-out, flaps fully extended with full power.  He was subjected to turbulence from the right, raising the right wing, at which time he lost some altitude.  He regained control with aileron and rudder input.  He realized that he was not climbing, instead he was losing altitude.  He said that he never regained enough altitude to raise the flaps.  He made a forced landing in rough terrain and thick brush, collided with a bush and nosed over.",The student pilot's failure to maintain appropriate airspeed and to configure the airplane for climb-out.

The accident flight was an instructional flight with two airline transport pilot-rated pilots aboard, of whom one was a flight instructor and the other was undergoing training to become a multiengine airplane flight instructor.  Approximately 1 hour after takeoff, the flight instructor initiated a simulated left engine failure situation approximately 5 nautical miles east of the airport.  A visual flight rules approach was performed to runway 27 with the left engine set to a zero-thrust condition.  During the landing flare, the student instructor (who, according to the flight instructor, was controlling the aircraft at the time) did not maintain alignment with the runway centerline.  The airplane's airspeed also dropped below the airplane's single-engine minimum control airspeed (Vmc) in the landing flare.  The flight instructor called for a go-around, both pilots advanced the throttles, and the aircraft ""accelerated normally and begin [sic] a climb"", according to the flight instructor.  The flight instructor then reduced flaps to 10 degrees.  The aircraft then began to roll and yaw to the left.  The flight instructor applied full right aileron and full right rudder, and reduced power on both engines in an effort to regain control.  The aircraft then struck the ground in approximately a 30-degree left banked attitude, spun around and caught fire.  Post-accident examinations of the aircraft's flight controls and left engine by FAA and Textron Lycoming investigators did not reveal any evidence of pre-impact mechanical discrepancies.","The student instructor's failure to maintain the airplane's minimum control airspeed during a practice single-engine approach, and the flight instructor's failure to direct or accomplish a timely go-around, resulting in loss of aircraft control with insufficient altitude for recovery.  A factor was the student instructor's failure to maintain runway alignment during the approach."

The right main landing gear collapsed when it struck a runway sign after a loss of directional control during landing.  The student pilot reported, ""At the point which I wanted to touchdown, my airspeed was still greater than I wanted, so I kept the aircraft off the ground until I reached a slower airspeed.  I encountered a gust of wind, which pushed the plane left with the wind, and at the same time I touched the ground.  As I touched the ground the plane immediately headed off the runway.  The result was hitting a runway marking sign causing the right main landing gear to collapse and causing damage to the right stabilizer.""  The student pilot also stated, ""I did not have enough crosswind correction for the winds, which caused my situation.""  The student pilot had a total of 18 hours of flight time, and the accident flight was the second solo flight.","The inadequate compensation for the crosswind by the student pilot.

Numerous witnesses, some as far away as 25 miles from the accident site, observed a low-flying airplane matching the description of the accident airplane.  It was seen to drop down to near  the surface of a reservoir, continue for several miles, then pull up and strike four 1/2-inch diameter aluminum high tension power lines that spanned the width of the reservoir.  Three lines carried 26,000 volts and the ground (static) line carried 12,000 volts.  The distance between the supporting structures was 1,245 feet.  The low point of the drooping cables was about 250 feet above the water's surface.  The cables were unmarked, and there are no regulations requiring that they be marked.  The airplane was flying towards a setting sun when the collision occurred.  Both pilots were commercial certificated, instrument rated, and flight instructors.  The airplane was equipped with dual flight controls; therefore, which pilot was serving as pilot-in-command during the flight is not known.  The medical examiner found a piece of paper clutched in the first (left seat) pilot's fist.  It was later identified as being a portion of the Denver Sectional Chart, and depicted an area just north of the accident site.  According to the pathologist, the injuries exhibited by the second (right seat) pilot were consistent with (and the injuries exhibited by the first pilot were not consistent with) being at the controls of the airplane. Toxicological screening revealed tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid (marijuana) in the second pilot's blood [0.0096 (ug/ml, ug/g)] and urine [0.0768 (ug/ml, ug/g)].

During an instructional flight, radar data identified the helicopter maneuvering in level flight before making a rapid descent below radar coverage.  About 33 seconds later, the helicopter was picked up on radar in a climbing right turn, then a left turn before radar contact was lost at an altitude of 1,500 feet MSL (1,060 AGL).  Witnesses in the area reported observing the helicopter make ""some radical flight maneuvers"" before it lost altitude.  The witnesses reported that the helicopter then descended in a ""nose down"" or ""wobbling"" attitude while it spun to the ground.  Prior to ground impact, several witnesses observed an object or objects separating from the helicopter before they lost site of it in the trees.  Two of the witnesses reported seeing the tail rotors separate followed by the tail section.  The helicopter then collided with trees.  During the on-site and post-accident investigation, it was determined that the tail rotor blades made contact with the side of the tail boom.  The empennage assembly was found about 180 feet away from the main wreckage.  Both tail rotor blades separated from the tail rotor hub.  Components that separated were due to overload.  Although a pitch change link and teeter bumper stop were not recovered, metallurgical examination of the tail rotor pitch control assembly determined that they were attached at impact. There was no evidence that pitch change control was lost prior to the tail rotor blade striking the tail boom. No evidence of a mechanical failure or malfunction was found.  Further investigation determined that abrupt application of full left pedal during a simulated power failure could result in excessive flapping of the tail rotor and possible tail rotor blade contact with the tail boom.  At the time of the accident, the mean tail rotor blade angle was 21.5 degrees to 22.0 degrees.  Approximately three months after the accident, the manufacturer issued a service bulletin to re-rig the tail rotor to reduce maximum blade angle at the left pedal stop and required the installation of a harder teeter bumper.  The mean tail rotor blade angle was changed to 16.5 degrees to 17.0 degrees.","An abrupt application of the tail rotor/anti-torque pedal by an unknown pilot resulting in tail rotor contact with the tail boom.

The airplane was in cruise flight at 8,000 feet in visual flight rules conditions, when the pilot reported he experienced a total loss of engine power.  At that time, the airplane was about 4 miles from an airport with a 2,920-foot long, asphalt runway.  The air traffic controller initially cleared the airplane to an airport more than 20 miles from it's position and then directed the airplane to an airport located on the other side of a ridgeline, about 12 miles away.   After the pilot reported he could not reach the airport, the controller then directed the airplane to the airport with the 2,920-foot long runway; however the airplane struck the top of a residence and a tree, before it came to rest inverted in a field, approximately 1.5 miles east of the runway.  Streaks of oil were present on the bottom of the fuselage and small holes were observed on the top portion of the engine crankcase near the number 5 cylinder.  Examination of the engine revealed that the number 5 piston was separated from it's respective connecting rod.  The bottom portion of the number 5 piston was broken into several small pieces, which were observed in the engine.  Examination of the intact fracture surfaces did not reveal any evidence of fatigue or preexisting cracks; however is was noted that only 75 percent of the number 5 piston boss area, and less then 25 percent of the number 5 piston skirt below the upper oil control ring was recovered.  The engine had been operated for about 70 hours since it was rebuilt by it's manufacturer and was installed in the accident airplane, about 11 months prior to the accident.",A loss of engine power due to a failure of the number 5 piston for undetermined reasons.   A factor in this accident was the inadequate emergency handling provided by the air route traffic controller.

The pilot was assigned a cruise altitude of 6,000 feet msl.  Radar recorded the airplane at 5,900 feet msl.  While in IMC, the airplane was vectored on to the final approach course for an ILS approach.  At localizer intercept, the airplane was descending approximately 500 fpm.  When the airplane was 5 miles from the LOM, the controller advised the pilot he was cleared for the approach, and that radar services were terminated.  The airplane crossed the LOM approximately a 1/4 mile right of course, and within 100 feet of the glide-slope crossing altitude of 2,837 feet msl.  After the LOM, the decent rate slowed to approximately 400 fpm, and the airplane continued to descend for about 1 minute 38 seconds.  The airplane leveled at 2,200 feet msl, and remained at that altitude until radar contact was lost about a minute later.  Approximately 2 miles from the airport, the pilot looked outside, to see if he could acquire the ground visually.  He saw the ground approaching from the front of the airplane seconds before impact.  The airplane impacted the ground, and came to rest about 80 feet below the elevation of the runway.  Prior to impact, the pilot thought the airplane was in level flight approximately 1,000 feet agl.

The student pilot departed in a glider from an airport with an elevation of 675 feet, and was aero-towed to 3,000 feet msl, over the airport, where he released.  Initially he stayed north of the airport and climbed to 4,000 feet.  He then headed to the northeast, while the winds were from the southwest.  Over a period of several minutes the glider lost 1,900 feet while the pilot was searching for thermals.  The pilot then elected to return to his departure airport.  En route to the airport, he encountered a rain shower, and was sinking 500 to 600 fpm.  He had insufficient altitude to reach the airport with the existing headwinds of 5 to 10 knots, and settled into trees about 1/4 of a miles from the approach end of the runway.  The glider club field safety manager reported that he had cautioned the pilot to remain upwind of the airport prior to his departure.  The pilot reported that he had focused his attention to finding lift and did not maintain his awareness of his proximity to the airport.","the student pilot's improper decision to fly northeast of the airport with winds from the southwest, and his subsequent diverted attention to the glider's proximity to the airport while he searched for thermals, which resulted in an off airport landing."

The airplane entered a left-hand traffic pattern for the runway and averaged 130 knots ground speed on the downwind leg.  The aircraft's average ground speed on final approach was 146 knots.  Review of the radar data depicted that the pilot would have had to fly a 5.06 degree descent angle from the last radar position in order to land at the runway's threshold.  An ear-witness, located at the airport, stated that he heard a reduction in engine power coming from a left downwind position, as if the airplane was coming in for a landing.  The ear-witness heard the airplane fly the traffic pattern, then heard the engine power being applied ""as if the pilot was intending to go-around or had performed a touch-and-go.""  The ear-witness subsequently heard two bangs followed by a louder bang.  The airplane impacted trees near the departure end of the runway and subsequently hit a paved road.  The airplane came to rest inverted on the side of the road and was consumed by fire.  The flaps and landing gear were found in the retracted positions.

During the pretakeoff check, the pilot observed that a mechanical malfunction existed with the vernier control button on the throttle knob.  It had partially unscrewed.  The pilot attempted to remedy the situation by screwing the knob back into place, and then he commenced the takeoff.  The airplane was loaded at or within 240 pounds of its certificated maximum gross weight, and the density altitude was about 7,700 feet.  The airplane accelerated, lifted off the ground, and gained about 30 feet.  The pilot had not received dual instruction in the airplane in high density altitude procedures, and he was not experienced in this type of operation.  Believing that the rate of climb was inhibited due to a downdraft, and with the wings rocking back and forth on the verge of stalling, the pilot retracted the landing gear in an effort at increasing the climb rate.  Still dissatisfied with the airplane's inability to climb, the pilot retarded the throttle to abort the takeoff.  He then tried to lower the landing gear.  When the pilot attempted to increase the throttle to provide more time for the gear to extend, the throttle control knob jammed due to the improperly secured screw.  The airplane impacted the runway with partially extended landing gear, and slid to a stop about 1,500 feet before reaching its departure end.",The pilot's improper aircraft handling and decision to prematurely raise the landing gear during takeoff.  Contributing factors were his lack of experience taking off under the high density altitude condition and his improper maintenance.

The flight was being handled as a VFR aircraft by air traffic control, was given a discreet transponder code, and was radar contact at an altitude of 4,500 feet.  The pilot requested a VFR decent from 4,500 feet, and was cleared to ""…descend unrestricted west bound.""  Radar and radio contact were lost at an altitude of 2,700 feet.  The controller tried to re-establish radio contact with the airplane's pilot 10 times before initiating search and rescue efforts.  A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter found the wreckage, using the aircraft's emergency locator transmitter.  The next day a ground search for the aircraft was halted because of hazardous terrain.  Search and rescue personnel had to be air lifted into the crash site to remove the victim.  A police helicopter was vectored to the crash site by ATC about an 1 1/2 hours after contact was lost with the flight, and the pilot reported that he could not fly near the crash site because of fog.  He reported the ceiling about 2,400 feet.  The aircraft impacted in heavily wooded, mountainous terrain at the 2,700-foot level of a 3,524-foot mountain.  Toxicology test showed that venlafaxine and desmethylvenlafaxine drugs were found in the pilot's blood, and the levels found were consistent with the recent ingestion of more than 10 times a normal dose of venlafaxine.","failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain altitude/clearance, resulting in an in-flight collision with rising terrain."

The solo certificated commercial pilot was departing for another airport about 5 miles away.  During the takeoff roll, as the airplane's airspeed approached 60 knots, the pilot applied aft control yoke pressure to rotate the nose of the airplane.  When the desired pitch angle for takeoff was attained, she released the back pressure, but the yoke failed to move forward.  The airplane then pitched-up uncontrollably, and she disengaged the electric trim, as she was concerned about a runaway trim condition.  She regained control of the airplane, noted that she had very limited aileron and elevator range of motion available, and elected to continue straight ahead to her next scheduled stop.  She added that she tried to transmit a ""mayday""  to other airplane’s in the area, but the radio transmit button, located on the pilot's control yoke, was now inoperative.  During the short flight, she was able to adjust the altitude and airspeed by adjusting engine power.  During approach to the accident airport, while using a combination of engine power, rudder, and the remaining amount of aileron control, she was able to maneuver the airplane for landing on runway 05.  As the airplane passed over the approach end of the runway, she attempted to flare just before touchdown.  The nose of the airplane failed to rise, and the nose wheel struck the gravel-covered runway.  The nose landing gear collapsed, and the airplane bounced off the right side of the runway.  A postaccident examination of the control yoke mechanism, behind the instrument panel, revealed that a wiring harness had become entangled in a series of roller bearings associated with the control yoke mechanism.  A subsequent inspection revealed that the accident airplane's control column did not have a required STA-Strap, part number S-2209-2, installed.  The proper installation of the required STA-Strap would provide proper clearance between the wiring harness, and the control yoke roller bearings.  The roller bearing assembly was disassembled, and the entangled wiring harness was removed.  The correct length for the factory installed wiring harness is 49 inches.  The wiring harness that was removed from the roller bearing assembly measured at 34 inches.  A review of the airplane's maintenance history disclosed no maintenance activity concerning the control yoke assembly.   A review of the FAA's aircraft registry database disclosed that the operator owned the airplane for about 11 years.  The airplane had been added to the operator's Approved Aircraft Inspection Program (AAIP), on February 11, 2001.  In order for an airplane to be initially placed on the AAIP, it must be inspected in accordance with AAIP Events1, 2, 3, and 4.  According to the operator's AAIP inspection schedule, an inspection of the control wheels, columns, pulleys, and cables, for condition is required during the Event 4 inspection.","A jammed control yoke during landing, an entangled wiring harness, and inadequate maintenance by company personnel.  A factor associated with the accident was the pilot's inability to flare the airplane during landing, due to the mechanical malfunction."

En route at 13,500 feet mean sea level, the airplane experienced engine vibrations that subsequently led to the pilot shutting the engine down and performing an off-airport landing.  During the forced landing roll, the airplane hit brush hidden rocks.  An on-scene examination revealed engine oil covering the bottom of the airplane.  A post accident examination of the engine revealed a catastrophic internal failure had occurred.  Further examination revealed an oil filter gasket was pinched and extruded around the oil filter base plate, allowing engine oil to escape.  On August 30, 2000, Textron Lycoming issued Mandatory Service Bulletin (SB) MSB-543A for the replacement of oil filter converter plate gaskets.  Time of compliance with the SB, initially, was before further flight and each 50 hours thereafter.  On September 5, 2000, the FAA issued Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) AD 2000-18-53 to mandate compliance with SB, MSB-543A.  The AD is sent to maintenance facilities and all registered airplane owners with this engine model.

The certificated commercial pilot reported that during a flight earlier on the day of the incident, he had difficulty controlling the propeller rpm, so he elected to make a precautionary landing.  The pilot related that after a mechanic replaced the propeller governor,  the airplane's engine and governor appeared to be operating normally, so they began their flight back to the operator's base.  He said that about 10 minutes after departure, while in cruise, level flight, he noted a light sheen of oil forming on the windshield, and he elected to make a precautionary landing on a remote beach.  As he retarded the throttle to start the descent,  the propeller rpm increased for about 20 seconds, followed by the propeller detaching from the engine.  He said that he was able to glide the airplane to the beach, and land without further incident.  The airplane was equipped with a Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) IO-520-F engine. The propeller and engine crankshaft flange were eventually recovered, and sent to the NTSB metallurgical laboratory for examination.  A Safety Board metallurgist examined the fractured crankshaft flange, and reported that his initial visual examination revealed a fatigue fracture, originating from a heat check site.  A postincident investigation revealed that the engine crankshaft had been replaced by TCM, 94.3 hours before the crankshaft separation.  An engine log book notation, entered by TCM, indicated that the reason for removal was: ""...for compliance with CSB 99-3A.""  According to a representative from TCM's in-house analytical laboratory the crankshaft was a remanufactured part that reportedly was ground undersize, and re-nitrided at TCM.   In the presence of an NTSB Investigator, the engine was disassembled.  The investigator noted a significant amount of heat discoloration, with modest circumferential scoring of two forward most  bearings, just aft of the fractured propeller shaft, indicating a localized loss of lubrication.  He added that the oil transfer collar assembly was fractured in one location.","An in-flight fracture of the engine crankshaft during descent, precipitated by restricted oil flow through an internal engine oil passage/port."

The airplane collided with obstructions during a forced landing precipitated by a loss of engine power.  In a radio exchange with the control tower, the pilot reported a total loss of oil pressure.  The airplane had accrued about 1 hour of flight time since a owner-assisted annual inspection was accomplished during which the owner changed the oil and filter element.  Post accident examination of the underside of the forward fuselage/engine compartment area revealed an oil filter element hanging free from the oil filter base by the installation safety wire and fresh oil on the underside of the fuselage.  The airplane had a STC'd remote mounted oil filter base that used a screw on filter element.  The installation location was in the aft engine compartment on the forward side of the firewall, requiring a blind insertion of the element by feel only onto the threaded shaft.  The only way to see the element pad and threaded shaft is by mirror or by looking up through the right cowl flap with a light.  Examination of the filter base revealed evidence of thread damage to the first complete thread in the bore.  The first 5 or 6 threads of the shaft were damaged, also with a cross the thread appearance to the first 2 or 3 threads.  Other threads were damaged and had the appearance of attempted file repair.  Both ends of the shaft revealed internal damage to the bore of the shaft.  During manufacture, the shaft is permanently factory installed to a depth about 5 threads with red Locktite and torqued into the base.  No evidence of Locktite was noted on the shaft or in the base bore.  According to the Aircraft Maintenance Technician and IA who approved the annual inspection, the pilot/owner had recently commented to him that other filter elements could be used besides the one specified for the system.  The pilot reportedly told the mechanic that you could either unscrew the 3/4-16 shaft from the other elements or the ones without a shaft could be screwed onto the shaft in the base unit.","The pilot/owner's failure to correctly install the oil filter, which resulted in oil exhaustion and a loss of engine power.  Also causal was his attempt to modify the design of the oil filter element adapter by breaking the bond between the base and the threaded shaft, which resulted in a loss of torque during filter element installation."

According to the commercial pilot, he reduced power on final approach and then experienced an ""extreme downdraft.""  He increased power in an attempt to arrest the excessive descent rate that ensued; however, he was unsuccessful.  The airplane struck the ground and bounced back into the air.  The pilot performed a go-around and conducted a low pass so that a person on the ground could examine the airplane.  He was told that the nose landing gear was collapsed and the right wing was bent down approximately 20 degrees.  The pilot performed another landing, during which the airplane skidded along the runway for 350 feet prior to veering off the side and nosing over.  The closest weather reporting facility, which was 18 miles away, reported the wind at 14 knots with gusts to 23 knots.  The pilot had accumulated a total of 32.2 hours of flight time in the accident airplane.

The pilot was demonstrating a short-field takeoff to his passenger at the time of the accident.  The pilot stated that the aircraft did not accelerate normally after rotation and at 50-feet above ground level it became obvious that the aircraft would not clear a tree line off the end of the runway.  The pilot elected to land the airplane on the remaining runway, was unable to stop the aircraft prior to the tree line, and collided with the trees.  The pilot reported, ""The takeoff roll was longer than normal (maybe 200 ft.) which I attributed to our heavy loading (approx. 25 lbs. under max. gross), the rough surface, and perhaps some to the 2220ft. density altitude HTL [Roscommon County Airport] AWOS [Automated Weather Observing System] was reporting.""  The pilot stated, ""I went to Vx [best angle-of-climb airspeed] but we were covering a lot of ground and making very little altitude.   I checked the tach which showed 2350-2400 rpm which should have been enough to climb.  At about 50ft. agl [above ground level]  with 70ft. trees ahead, It became obvious we would not clear them.

During landing touchdown, following a stabilized approach, the right main landing gear failed.  The airplane remained controllable by the pilots and came to a stop on the runway, resting on its right wing.  The DFW Fire Department arrived at the accident site in 35 seconds and, following communication between the airplane's Captain and Fire Department's Incident Commander, it was decided that an emergency evacuation of the airplane was not necessary.  Examination revealed that the right main gear's outer cylinder had fractured allowing the lower portion of the gear (including the wheel assembly) to separate from the airplane.  Research, examination & testing of the cylinder revealed that a forging fold was introduced into the material during the first stage of its forging process.  The first stage is a hand operation, therefore the quality is highly dependent on the person performing the hand operation.  Following the first landing, the forging fold became a surface breaking crack, due to the normal loads imposed during landing.  Although growth of the fatigue crack was suppressed by crack blunting, high load landings resulted in growth of the fatigue crack.  Subsequently, the landing gear failed when the crack had reached a critical length.  Additionally, the airplane's maintenance records were reviewed and no anomalies were found.","A forging fold that was introduced during the manufacture of the right main landing, which resulted in a fatigue crack in the right main landing gear cylinder, and its subsequent failure during landing."

The instructor had just completed 30 minutes of hover practice with the student.  The student landed the helicopter and the instructor deplaned to allow the student to execute his first solo flight.  As the instructor watched, the student began to liftoff and immediately rolled to the right and crashed.  According to the instructor, the helicopter never left the ground.  The student had logged approximately 29 hours of dual instruction in the R22 prior to the accident.  The instructor stated that he had done many pickups and set downs with the student just prior to the accident.  He emphasized the differences in flight characteristics that the student would experience when the instructor was not in the helicopter.  He explained that he had covered dynamic rollover situations in ground school sessions, including a Robinson factory training videotape on the subject.  The instructor normally occupied the left seat of the helicopter during dual lessons.  At the time of the accident, the student was occupying the right seat, and the left seat was empty.  The solo flight was conducted on an asphalt helicopter landing pad.  Inspectors from the Federal Aviation Administration found no evidence of preaccident mechanical failure.  The helipad was inspected and found to be clean, smooth, and free of obstructions.  The instructor weighed 185 pounds, and the helicopter had consumed 30 pounds of fuel prior to the attempted solo flight.  This made the helicopter 215 pounds lighter than the student was accustomed to.  If the student did not exercise extreme caution to liftoff very slowly and deliberately, with the cyclic centered, a dynamic rollover would be very likely to occur.  With an excessive input of collective, the helicopter at a light takeoff weight and the cyclic even slightly off center, the roll would be extremely rapid and nearly impossible to arrest.",The solo student's improper use of the flight controls that resulted in a dynamic rollover during the attempted takeoff.

The two pilots had arrived from Europe 3 days before the accident to take part in a 2 week long world record soaring attempt.  They departed on runway 21 (elevation 4,200 feet) in a self-launch motorized glider and turned east towards the mesa (elevation 9,100 feet).  A fellow pilot said that the motor is usually stowed at 1,000 meters, and the stowing process takes between 2 to 3 minutes.  The aircraft is flown strictly as a glider after that.  The glider disappeared from radar approximately 10 minutes later.  Two other gliders departed within 30 minutes, and they reported good uplift and strong downdrafts.  The mesa top was heavily forested and the temperature was approximately 25 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than the departure airport.  The downed glider was found 3 days later, and the impact signatures suggest a flight track of 235 degrees.  The accident aircraft was found approximately 300 to 400 yards from the western edge of the mesa.  The toxicological report on the second pilot (the pilot flying) indicated that he had Phenobarbital in his liver and kidney.  The FAA does not approve of this prescribed medication in pilots, while they are on flight status.",The flight crew's inadequate in-flight planning to fly over the mesa with insufficient altitude.

A witness observed the airplane in a ""steep climb and high bank angle"" when the engine lost power.  The airplane spiraled down and impacted the ground ""relatively flat"".   Examination of the airplane's fuel system by an FAA inspector revealed that the fuselage fuel tank was compromised, and the fuel lines to the wing fuel tanks were fractured.   A law enforcement officer and emergency medical service personnel, who responded to the accident site, reported that there was an odor of fuel when they arrived on scene.   Flight control continuity was established; however, the reason for the loss of engine power was not determined.  According to the FAA inspector, the pilot had logged a total of 62 flight hours, of which 5 hours were in the same make and model as the accident airplane.

.","the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control following a loss of engine power while maneuvering, which resulted in an inadvertent stall/spin.

The airplane impacted terrain during an attempted rejected landing after the student loss control of the airplane during a landing roll.  The flight instructor reported the student conducted a uneventful landing on runway 14 with proper control inputs and had placed the aircraft within 3 feet of centerline.  As the airplane's nose wheel settled on the runway, the right wing ""suddenly lifted, the aircraft rotated to the left, and [the airplane was] airborne.""  The flight instructor took control of the aircraft, applied full power, lowered the nose, and attempted to regain control of the airplane.  As he maneuvered the aircraft to the left toward a clearing away from a building, the airplane impacted the ground with the left wing first, followed by the nose.  The student had utilized 30 degrees of flaps during the landing and had not raised the flaps during the landing roll.  A witness indicated that their flights were cancelled that day due to the gusty crosswind conditions.  The closest weather observation facility reported the wind from 230 degrees (variable between 200 and 260 degrees) at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots.  The flight school's Airplane Maneuvers Guide, under a section titled ""Normal and Crosswind Approach and Landing,"" had a note indicating, ""CROSSWIND CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE A REDUCED FLAP SETTING FOR APPROACH AND LANDING.  CARE MUST BE EXCERCISED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE RUNWAY LENGTH.""  The section also indicates, ""Gusty wind conditions may require a touchdown at a slightly higher speed than normal (5-10 KIAS above power-off stall speed) and a slightly lower than normal pitch attitude.  A reduced flap setting may also be necessary.""  The Pilot Information Manual for the accident airplane indicates that the maximum demonstrated crosswind component was 15 knots.  Review of the student's flight records revealed he had received an unsatisfactory rating during a stage check flight about 1 month prior to the accident.  One of the reasons listed for the unsatisfactory rating was ""improper x-wind (crosswind) correction during taxi.""",the student's inadequate compensation for the gusty crosswind conditions and the subsequent loss of aircraft control during landing roll.  The flight instructor’s inadequate supervision and his inadequate remedial action is also causal.  Contributing factors were the gusty and crosswind weather conditions.

The flight during which the accident took place was the maiden flight for the recently completed tailwheel-equipped experimental aircraft. After flying familiarization maneuvers for about 30 minutes, the pilot returned to the departure airfield, where he made two preplanned low approaches in order to establish the best indicated airspeed for his first landing. During his third approach, which was intended to terminate in a full-stop landing, the pilot was high on final. He therefore applied right rudder to slip the aircraft in order to lose altitude. Although the pilot eliminated most of the slip as he flared the aircraft for landing, as it floated down the runway, he inadvertently allowed the nose to begin rotating to the right. Then, just before the aircraft touched down, the nose of the aircraft rotated further to the right. The aircraft touched down in a significant right crab and immediately rocked up onto its left main gear. At the same time, it started increasing its rate of turn to the right. About 275 feet from where the aircraft touched down, the left main gear experienced an overload failure, followed immediately by the right. As the right main gear collapsed, it tore a portion of the right wing fuel tank wall loose, and a large volume of fuel was released into the wheel well. As the right wing settled to the asphalt surface, a massive fire broke out, which ultimately consumed the aircraft. It was later determined that the pilot had made only four landings in a tailwheel equipped aircraft in the last year, none of which were in the make and model he was flying at the time of the accident. It was further determined that the pilot attempted the landing in a tailwind of approximately five knots.","the pilot's failure to ensure the aircraft's longitudinal axis was aligned with the runway prior to touchdown, and his failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll. Factors include landing with a tailwind, and the pilot's lack of recent experience in the particular make and model aircraft.  A factor in the severity of the post-accident fire was the kit manufacturer's inadequate  design, which allowed the excessive side-load failure of a main gear leg to pull a portion of the wall from a wing fuel tank."

The pilot noted the wind sock indicated the wind was about 20 degrees left of runway centerline. After making a normal crosswind landing, the airplane nosed to the right and he made a correction. When the airplane assumed a three point attitude, it veered to the left. He corrected with right rudder ""without letting the wind under left wing"" but it had no effect and the airplane departed the runway and nosed over. The pilot said the bolt securing the tail wheel leaf spring had sheared and the tail wheel was driven up against the rudder. A search of the area failed to locate the nut or the bolt end. He said the break was an ""extrusion and clean downward shear,"" but an FAA inspector who examined the airplane stated the damage was consistent with that of a hard landing. Official recorded winds were 320 degrees at 7 knots, with gusts to 14 knots.","the pilot inadvertently flaring the airplane too high above the ground, resulting in a hard landing that sheared a bolt in the tail wheel assembly. This rendered directional control impossible and induced an uncontrolled ground loop. A contributing factor was the crosswind."

The engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion after 2.1 hours of flight and 16-miles before reaching the intended destination.  The pilot attributed the fuel exhaustion to an interruption that occurred during his (self) fueling of the aircraft, which resulted in the fuel tanks not being totally full on takeoff.  As he was filling the left wing fuel tank before takeoff, the pilot was interrupted by another pilot who asked his assistance with operation of the self-fueling equipment.  He completed filling the left tank and stopped to assist the other pilot.  He returned to his airplane about 10 or 15 minutes later, filled the right-wing tank, and departed.  The pilot believed that, during the  interruption, a portion of the fuel in the left tank flowed across the aircraft to the right tank and, after he filled the right tank, the left tank was approximately 5 gallons below capacity.  He reported making the same trip regularly.  Assuming a zero to 5-knot headwind, the trip routinely required 20.3 or 20.4 gallons to complete.  The aircraft had been modified to install a larger engine than the original and had a 24-gallon usable fuel capacity.  The pilot reported that, on past flights at the same altitude and power setting, the engine consumed 9.17 gallons per hour (2.6 hours endurance).","The pilot's failure to properly refuel the aircraft which resulted in departure with an inadequate quantity of fuel onboard.  A factor in the accident was the pilot's inadequate preflight preparation and planning, which failed to provide an adequate fuel reserve for the flight intended."

While a mechanic was performing a ""Predispatch Ops Check"" on the airplane from the cockpit, ground personnel notified him that smoke was observed coming from the aft stairwell.  Fire extinguishing agents were applied to the area and the fire was contained.  Examination of the airplane after the incident revealed that the insulation on a wire to the standby hydraulic system electric motor pump had chafed through, allowing the wire conductor to contact a hydraulic system ""A"" case drain return line.  Approximately four feet above the hydraulic line, a 1-inch by 3/16 inch hole was observed in the backside of a reservoir pressurization line, which was fed by a 13th stage bleed-air line. According to Equipment Quality Analysis Reports submitted by Boeing, the chafing between the standby hydraulic pump electrical power wire, and the hydraulic system ""A"" case drain return line, exposed the standby pump conductor wire and resulted in electrical arcing/puncture to the system ""A"" return line, followed by ignition to the mist of hydraulic oil leaking from the hole in the line.  The wire bundle/tube chafing condition appeared to have occurred from inadvertent mis-routing of the wire bundle during maintenance activity.","The inadvertent misrouting of a wire harness by maintenance personnel, which resulted in chafing to a hydraulic line and electrical wire, and subsequent fire."

The glider pilot reported that during takeoff, he had to maintain a crab of 15 degrees into the wind in order to track down the runway centerline.  Shortly after lift-off, the glider gained altitude abruptly and ascended to an altitude above the tow airplane.  The glider pilot reported that he had encountered ""severe turbulence"" and was caught in an ""extreme updraft.""  He remembered looking up at the sky, losing sight of the tow airplane, and being ""jarred about the cockpit"" while attempting to disengage the towrope.  He recalled that his altimeter was indicating 440 feet agl approximately midway down the runway at the time he released the towrope, and he estimated the tow airplane to be 150 feet lower than his glider.  The glider completed a normal traffic pattern and landed on the runway.  The glider pilot mentioned that his glider had a tendency for the trim lever to release from its ""full nose down"" trim position, which is the recommended takeoff trim lever position, and ""snatch"" back to the ""full nose up"" position.  He remembered having to push forward during the initial climb to counteract a nose up effect.

On approach to the destination, the landing gear, which is extended by hydraulic actuators powered by an electrically-powered hydraulic power pack, failed to extend.  Attempts to recycle the gear and to employ the emergency gear extension procedure (utilizing a hand-operated emergency hydraulic pump) were unsuccessful.  The pilot then checked the fluid level in the hydraulic reservoir and found the reservoir empty.  He attempted to refill it with various available fluids, but this also proved ineffective in restoring landing gear operation.  A passenger succeeded in opening the cabin door and manually pulling the right main gear into the down-and-locked position; the pilot was also able to pull the left main gear into the down position, but the left main gear would not lock down.  The pilot subsequently diverted to Portland International Airport (PDX) and performed an emergency landing on runway 28R, an 8,000- by 150-foot grooved asphalt runway.  During the emergency landing, the aircraft dropped to a 30-degree left wing down attitude upon touchdown, then turned 180 degrees to the left and came to rest in the grass alongside the runway, sustaining substantial damage in the landing.  The pilot reported that a post-accident inspection revealed that a hydraulic line in the nose gear well had burst, allowing a total loss of hydraulic fluid from the system.","A burst hydraulic line and consequent total loss of hydraulic fluid from the landing gear, which disabled landing gear operation."

The airplane was destroyed when it impacted trees and terrain after a loss of control while maneuvering.  The pilot said that he and his passenger  were flying near his house at 800 feet above ground level so that the passenger could photograph the residence.  The pilot said that he reduced airspeed and lowered 10-15 degrees of flaps, keeping the airspeed at the upper end of the flap operating range.  The pilot stated that he executed a turn to the left.  The pilot stated that when he began the left turn, he heard a, ""loud pop in the left wing.""  He said that the control yoke was, ""jerked out of [his] hand to the full left stop.""  The pilot said that the airplane continued to roll to the left even with full right aileron input.  He stated that he lowered the flaps in an effort to, ""slow [the airplane] down a little and therefore lessen the impact. However, all this did was intensify the roll.""  The airplane subsequently impacted trees and terrain. The flap control system was examined and a break in the flap control cable was observed.  The broken flap cable and the right hand inboard pulley and bracket assembly were retained for further examination.  No other anomalies were found.  The broken flap cable, flap pulley, and pulley bracket were examined at the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory in Washington, D.C.  The cable break contained signatures consistent with overstress failure.

A de Havilland DHC-6 and a Beech King Air 90 were to make a formation air drop of skydivers from 14,000 feet msl.  The de Havilland was to be the lead aircraft with the King Air in trail.  As the skydivers prepared to exit, the King Air was traveling faster than the de Havilland, and the pilot of the King Air had to pitch up and bank right to avoid the de Havilland.  At that time, the pilot of the King Air lost sight of the de Havilland.  A video tape taken by one of the skydivers showed that at the time the skydivers exited, the King Air was above, right, and ahead of the de Havilland.  One of the King Air skydivers contacted the right propeller of the de Havilland.  Other skydivers then saw this skydiver spinning out of control.  One of these skydivers caught the injured skydiver and pulled the reserve handle; however, the reserve parachute did not fully inflate ""due to being cut by the propeller.""  The injured skydiver fell to the ground.  Both airplanes landed without further incident.  The operator reported that this was the first formation air drop flight for either pilot in a multi-engine aircraft.","the King Air pilot's inadequate in-flight planning/decision in that he failed to remain in the agreed on formation position, resulting in one of his skydiver's contacting the propeller of the de Havilland airplane.

He filed a VFR flight plan to Hawthorne, but there is no record that he flew to Hawthorne. The airplane, with the pilot and 3 adult passengers on board, was reported missing. Six days later, fishermen found airplane debris floating in Upper Marvine Lake, located about 30 miles east of Meeker, CO. The debris was identified as having come from the missing airplane. The airplane had stopped in Meeker for fuel, and was en route to the Denver area. The wreckage was recovered, and examination disclosed no discrepancies with the airframe, engine, and propeller. The airplane was estimated to have been 111 pounds overweight when it departed Meeker, elevation 6,421 feet msl. Toxicological tests revealed the pilot had amphetamine and methamphetamine in blood and urine. The levels found in the blood were high, suggestive of regular use and probable addiction. The effects of methamphetamine include increased alertness, euphoria, insomnia, and increased self-confidence. Long-term use could lead to paranoia, loss of physical coordination, and weight loss. If use were to be discontinued, within hours a regular user might experience severe withdrawal symptoms, including depression, fatigue, abdominal cramps, and headache. Overdoses may result in loss of consciousness or seizures. Regular users can tolerate high doses. The levels found in the blood indicate the pilot had recently used methamphetamine and was impaired by its effect. This could have led him to attempt maneuvers beyond his abilities. Although possible but not likely, the pilot could have had an acute event resulting in incapacitation, such as fainting or seizure.",the pilot's failure to maintain terrain clearance as a result of his drug induced impairment.

The aircraft was on an instrument training flight at the time of the occurrence.  The flight was cleared to an altitude of 6,000 feet on departure.  The trainee reported that as the aircraft climbed through 4,500 feet, with the instructor flying the aircraft, ""the airplane pitched up, and rolled to the left followed by a pitch down, and a roll back to wings level, then a pitch back up and to the left.""  The instructor stated that as the aircraft climbed through that altitude, ""the aircraft suddenly nosedived for about 3-4 seconds and pitched up into a climb.""  Both pilots reported that they susbsequently felt the pitch control stuck in a pitch-up position, and that they had to hold forward pressure to hold the nose down (the instructor stated both pilots had to apply full forward pressure to prevent a stall.)  The instructor further reported that the aircraft would not roll; the trainee reported that the controls were stuck in roll to the left.  The pilots reported that the instructor subsequently attempted to trim the aircraft nose-down, without success.  The pilots declared an emergency with ATC and subsequently elected to land in a field directly in front of the aircraft by utilizing rudder and power for control, which they accomplished successfully.  The pilots reported in their initial interview with the FAA inspector that they did not have the autopilot on at the time of the occurrence, and that they made no attempts to disengage the autopilot during the incident.  Post-incident examinations of the flight controls, trim, and autopilot operation by the operator, an FAA inspector, and the autopilot manufacturer did not disclose any evidence of malfunctions or abnormal flight control or autopilot operation.",A degradation of aircraft control for undetermined reasons.

The private certificated pilot was departing a river in a float-equipped airplane.  During the takeoff run, the airplane came up on-step, but started to veer to the left.  The pilot was holding full right rudder, but the airplane continued to turn left.  He aborted the takeoff, but the left float collided with the bank of the river, and the right wing struck a tree.  The airplane received damage to the left float assembly, the fuselage at the forward left float attach point, and the leading edge wing slat of the right wing.  The float assembly was installed the previous month, 11.5 hours before the accident under a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC).  Since the float installation, the pilot said he had trouble obtaining full right rudder travel of the aerodynamic rudder.  After the accident, a mechanic found an incorrect set of springs, as part of the water rudder/aerodynamic rudder rigging, installed on the airplane.  An FAA airworthiness inspector reviewed the tail spring concerns raised by the pilot.  She found that the float installation STC specified the use of D-376 water rudder steering springs.  Due to the lack of immediate availability, the installer used Scott 3200 tailwheel steering springs.  The installer told the FAA inspector that due to the similarity of the two spring sets, he has utilized Scott 3200 tailwheel springs in the past on other float installations, utilizing FAA field approvals, and substitution of the springs have been widely used in the floatplane industry.  In this case, the installer did not obtain an FAA field approval.  The installer told the FAA that when the floats were installed on the accident airplane, the rigging of the water and aerodynamic rudders allowed proper movement of each assembly.  The installer reported that the difference in the two spring assemblies, as measured by applying a 40 pound weight to each set, was 3/8 inch further extension of the D-376 springs.","The pilot's continued operation of the accident airplane with known equipment deficiencies, and an improper installation of the float assembly by maintenance personnel.  A factor in the accident was the pilot's delay in aborting the takeoff."

The certificated private pilot reported to the NTSB that while on approach to landing to the west, he encountered winds estimated to be from 220 degrees at 20 knots with gusts to 25 knots, which required a left crosswind correction.  He said as the airplane continued on the approach, he inadvertently allowed the airplane to fly further down the runway than anticipated, so he applied full engine power to go-around.  He said that during the go-around attempt, a very strong gust of wind pushed the airplane to the right, and the airplane's airspeed rapidly diminished.   The nose of the airplane continued to the right, and the right wing stalled.  The right wing and right main wheel struck the ground, and the right main landing gear collapsed.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, and right wing.","The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions while on approach, and the inadvertent stall of the airplane while attempting a go-around.

The private certificated pilot was departing a lake in a float-equipped airplane.  While preparing to depart the lake, the pilot said he unknowingly punctured the left float during a collision with an unknown object.  The float partially filled with water.  During the takeoff run, the pilot said the airplane became airborne in ground effect, but would not climb.  He aborted the takeoff and the airplane settled on the lake and hit hard.  The pilot said he did not think the fuselage was significantly damaged.  A postaccident inspection of the airplane revealed that a fuselage longeron was bent about 2 inches, adjacent to the left, aft, float attachment point.  A mechanic planned to cut the bent portion of the longeron out of the fuselage and install a repair sleeve.","The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for takeoff, and an excessive descent rate resulting in a hard landing during an aborted takeoff.  Factors in the accident were a collision of the airplane's float assembly with an unknown object, and the pilot's delay in aborting the takeoff."

An Air Tractor 201 impacted the terrain 4.5 miles northeast of Mount Vernon, South Dakota.  A witness said he was outside in his farmyard working when he heard an airplane working east of his farm.  The witness said he saw the airplane a couple of times as it was making turns.  The witness said he could hear the airplane's engine.  He then heard a loud crash noise and didn't hear the airplane's engine anymore.  An examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies.  FAA toxicology testing of specimens from the pilot showed trace levels of QUININE in blood.  Quinine is found in tonic water and is used to treat malaria.  It is also commonly used to reduce the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps - a condition which may cause painful leg muscle spasm at night, and was available over-the-counter for this purpose until 1995.  The side effects of quinine can include disturbances of vision, hearing, and balance.  According to the pilot's brother, tonic water was the pilot's favorite beverage.  The night prior to the accident, the pilot was observed drinking tonic water with his dinner.",the pilot not maintaining aircraft control while maneuvering close to the ground.

The airplane collided with the terrain following a loss of control during landing.  The pilot reported that while en route he listened to the automated weather observing system (AWOS) for the destination airport and the winds were variable, but at a low speed.  The pilot made an approach to land on runway 34.  He reported that about 10-15 feet after main gear touchdown a gust of wind lifted the aircraft 8-10 feet above the runway.  The airplane settled again and when it was about 5 feet  above the ground a ""sudden violent gust"" lifted the airplane and it rolled between 120 and 150 degrees.  The pilot reported he rolled the airplane level, advanced the throttle, raised the landing gear and removed 10 degrees of flaps.  He reported that by this time the airplane was headed for a grove of trees off the west side of the runway.  The airplane contacted the tops of the trees and settled to the ground.  The pilot reported that at the time of the accident the winds were variable at 5 - 7 knots, gusting to 12 knots.  A local weather observation taken at 1517, reported the winds were from 040 degrees at 8 knots.",The pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions and the failure to maintain control of the airplane.

Shortly after departure on a cross-country flight, the airplane collided with trees on the peak of a mountain and was destroyed when it descended uncontrollably into a ravine.   The commercial and instrument rated pilot and his two passengers were fatally injured.  The pilot contacted the Denver Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS), in Englewood, Colorado, and requested an en route weather briefing, VFR if possible.  The air traffic control Specialist who took his call provided the weather information pertaining to the local conditions and the forecast conditions for his intended route.  She advised him that along his entire route there were Airmets for turbulence and IFR conditions and a cold front, which included thunderstorm activity.  She provided him a VNR statement (indicating that VFR flight was not recommended).  According to witnesses at the departure airport, the weather was cool and humid with light winds, a visibility of 3 to 4 miles and a ceiling of 300 to 700 feet.  They observed the aircraft as it made a ""very flat, but fast,"" departure from runway 29.  At about 500 feet above ground level, the airplane entered the clouds and shortly thereafter, it descended and re-emerged from the cloud base and proceeded out of visual range to the northwest.  Witnesses at the accident site stated that the visibility was approximately 100 feet and the ceiling was approximately 100 feet at the time of the accident.  A witness who observed the impact, stated that he heard the airplane's engine ""rev up to full throttle,"" while it was still in the clouds and it emerged from the clouds in a very steep descent.  The airplane hit the ground first with its left wing and then bounced and rolled into the gulch.  An examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies.","The pilot's inadequate preflight planning/preparation and his continued flight into adverse weather condition resulting in controlled flight into terrain.  Contributing factors were the fog, low ceilings and the pilot's lack of recent experience."

The airplane departed Visalia, California, approximately 0945, for the 10-mile flight to Mefford Field.  The flight purpose was to practice takeoffs and landings on the student's eighth solo flight.  Two witnesses were at the Farm Exposition grounds, located adjacent to, and at the departure end, of runway 31 at Mefford Field.  They noticed that the wing flaps were extended to what was believed to be the full down position.  They saw the airplane climb straight out until it reached what was estimated to be 200 to 250 feet above the ground.  One witness noticed the airplane begin a turn to the left, in a westerly direction, and saw the nose come up to a higher attitude.  He remarked that the airplane was going to stall.  Shortly thereafter, the witness saw the airplane snap to the left, make one complete rotation to the left, with the left wing slightly lower of the right, and disappear behind some buildings.  The second witness, who is a certificated pilot, was conversing with the first witness.  He turned to speak to the first witness, who remarked, ""It's going to stall.""  When he turned back to look, the airplane had disappeared behind the buildings.  During the post crash examination of the wreckage, the flap jackscrew actuator was measured.  It was extended 5.9 inches, which indicates a flap position of 40 degrees down.  The cockpit flap switch was operated, and the switch locked in the up position when activated.  The flap fuse was removed and tested.  It was shown that the fuse had continuity.  Power was applied to the wing flap motor using a 12-volt battery and electrical leads.  The motor ran and moved the wing flap jackscrew throughout its range of motion in both directions.  The flight instructor who had completed all of the pilot's training was interviewed.  The instructor stated he had verbally restricted the student to make full stop landings only, for this particular flight.  The instructor did not include this restriction on the solo endorsement.  It was not determined if the student had done a full stop, touch-and-go, or a go-around.",The student's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the crosswind climb that resulted in a stall/spin at low altitude and the airplane's subsequent ground impact.  A factor was the student's failure to retract the wing flaps.

The helicopter experienced a loss of engine power while in cruise flight.  The helicopter was on its way to a rugged area to rescue a person.  The pilot indicated that the engine out warning system activated, and he autorotated to a creek after determining that he was unable to manually control the engine power.  The pilot performed the autorotation landing to a steep and highly vegetated area.  Post-accident examination of the engine revealed its turbine section sustained hot corrosion (sulfidation) damage, which reduced the cross sectional area of the airfoils.  The degree of hot corrosion damage suggests that multiple over temperature events occurred over a number of flights.  The reduced cross section resulted in the liberation of one or more of the airfoils in tensile overload.  The failure of the airfoils resulted in secondary over temperature and failure of other airfoils in the turbine section and eventual turbine seizure.  Examination of the TOT thermocouples revealed three of the four leads were broken; however, it could not be determined as to when the fractures occurred.","a loss of engine power while in cruise flight resulting from the failure and liberation of several turbine blades due to hot corrosion effects which weakened the blades.

Witnesses from the skydiving business observed the pilot board the rented airplane and depart about 1915. The pilot obtained flight following for part of the flight. Recorded radar data showed that the airplane track proceeded along a northerly heading, and then turned toward the west.  Approach control informed the pilot that they would be losing radar contact soon, and advised the pilot to proceed under visual flight rules.  The pilot responded that he was 17 to 18 miles from his intended destination.  No further transmissions were received from the pilot. The corrected mode C reported altitude remained steady at 2,500 feet mean sea level until the target initiated a climb to 2,900 feet about 1 1/2 minutes prior to a loss of radar contact. The last target occurred in the mouth of a box canyon.  This target displayed a corrected mode C reported altitude of 2,900 feet at 1931:47. Data from a portable global positioning satellite system in the airplane indicated that the airplane continued up the canyon and began climbing. It turned to the south prior to impacting the terrain. The operator reported the airplane overdue 3 days later and an extensive search did not locate the airplane. The wreckage was discovered on September 21, 2008. The airplane wreckage came to rest at an estimated elevation of 5,600 feet on a steep slope near the top southern side of a box canyon.  The canyon is generally oriented east/west. The orientation of the fuselage was about 180 degrees. Investigators examined the airframe and engine and discovered no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.  Sunset occurred around 1953 on the day of the accident.  Weather reporting stations surrounding the accident site noted broken to overcast cloud conditions between 2,800 and 4,400 feet.",The pilot's inadequate decision to fly into an area of rising terrain.

About 20 minutes before the accident, the pilot reported to the air traffic controller that he had a problem with an engine and needed to shut the engine down. The flight had just leveled at 23,000 feet. The controller told the pilot that he was near Jackson, Tennessee, and that he could descend to 7,000 feet. About 10 minutes later, the pilot reported he was at 8,000 feet and requested radar vectors for the instrument landing system approach to runway 2 at the McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport, at Jackson. The pilot told the controller he had the left engine shut down. About 5 minutes later, the pilot reported he had a propeller runaway. About 1 minute later, the pilot reported he was in visual conditions and requested radar vectors direct to the airport. About 2 minutes later, the pilot reported he had a cloud layer under him and that he had the localizer frequency for runway 2 set. About 1 minute later, the pilot was told to contact the McKellar Airport control tower. The pilot acknowledged this instruction. No further transmissions were received from the flight. Examination of the left engine at the accident site showed the left propeller control was found disconnected at the point the propeller control extension bracket attaches to the propeller governor. The propeller control cable had also pulled loose from a swaged point at the control rod and was also separated further aft due to overstress. The housing for the propeller control rod was found securely attached to the engine and the control rod was securely attached to the extension bracket. The propeller governor control arm, which was disconnected from the propeller control cable and rod, was found spring loaded into the high RPM position. Examination of the fractured left propeller bracket assembly was performed by the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, D.C. The bracket assembly was fractured in the area of the outermost eyehole, at the point a bolt passes through the bracket assembly and the propeller governor arm. The fracture surface contained small amounts of dirt, grease, and minor corrosion. The fracture surface features include flat areas that lie on multiple planes separated by ratchet marks, features typically left behind by the propagation of a fatigue crack. The fatigue crack emanated from multiple origins on opposite sides of the bracket. The total area of the fatigue crack occupied approximately 85 percent of the fracture surfaces. The fatigue fractures initiated on the outer edges of the surface and propagated inward toward the center. The remaining 15% of the fracture surface had features consistent with overstress separation. Near the middle of each fatigue region were micro-fussures suggesting that the crack propagated under high-stress conditions. The NTSB Materials Laboratory also examined the separation point between the left propeller control flexible cable and the rigid rod that connects to the bracket assembly. The cable and the swaged part of the rigid rod were in good condition with no fractures or damage. The Piper PA-31-T2 Pilot Operating Handbook, Section 3, Emergency Procedures, does not contain a procedure for loss of propeller control. Section 3 did contain a procedure for ""Over speeding Propeller"", which stated that if a propellers speed should exceed 1,976 rpm, to place the power lever of the engine with the over speeding propeller to idle, feather the propeller, place the engine condition lever in the stop position, and complete the engine shutdown procedures. Pilot logbook records show the pilot completed a simulator training course for the accident model airplane about 9 days before the accident and had about 13 flight hours in the Piper PA-31-T2.","The pilot's shutting down the left engine following loss of control of the left propeller resulting in an in-flight loss of control of the airplane due to the windmilling propeller. Factors in the accident were the failure of the propeller control bracket assembly due to fatigue, the pilot's lack of experience in the type of airplane (turbo propeller) and the absence of a procedure for loss of propeller control in the airplane's flight manual."

According to the pilot, he was enroute when the engine lost power and quit.  During an emergency descent out of 4500 feet, the pilot attempted to restore full engine power but failed.  During the emergency descent to land in a hilly farm field, the airplane's left wing struck a utility pole severing the left wing from the airplane.  During the onsite inspection, the two main fuel tanks were found to be empty as well as the right auxiliary fuel tank. The left auxiliary fuel tank had approximately 11.5 gallons. 
The pilot attempted, but was unable to switch to the left auxiliary fuel tank due to a blown fuse.   The fuses to the auxiliary fuel tanks are not accessible to the pilot in flight, this resulted in his inability to check them for condition or replace them, in flight.",The pilot's inflight fuel planning /decision that resulted in fuel starvation and a loss of engine power.

The student pilot lost control of the single engine airplane during the takeoff initial climb with a tailwind and collided with trees while descending in the crosswind turn.  The student departed with an 8-knot tailwind.  The UNICOM frequency was reported to be in operation; however, no one reported hearing the accident airplane request departure information or make a position report.  According to a pilot witness, the airplane was unable to gain altitude after leaving ground effect and the nose pitched up and to the left, and began to ""oscillate back and forth as if it was having difficulty in trying to climb.""  The witness added the airplane made a shallow left-hand turn and the nose began to pitch up, then the airplane ""stalled and the aircraft went nose down.""  The student pilot was a paraplegic and had obtained approximately 74 total hours of flight time, of which approximately 25 hours were accumulated in the same make and model as the accident airplane.  The student had accumulated approximately 6 hours of solo flight time prior to the accident flight.  The aircraft utilized a rudder hand control, which allowed the pilot to operate the rudder pedals manually.  The student had performed a demonstrated ability flight utilizing the hand control 5 days before the accident.  A post accident examination of the wreckage revealed the propeller had sliced through 4-inch thick tree branches.  The right magneto would not operate following the accident and it was noted that the breaker points would not open, oil and dirt were found in the magneto housing, and the magneto's drive was excessively loose.  At the time of the last annual inspection, the engine's magneto timing was checked.  A service bulletin issued for the affected magneto required an inspection of the magnetos every 500 hours.  At the time of the accident, the magneto had accumulated a total time in service of 1,256.36 hours, and there was no entry indication the service bulletin had been complied with.  No other anomalies were noted with the airplane and engine.  The density altitude was computed to be 8,400 feet.",the student pilot's selection of a takeoff runway conducive to a tailwind weather condition and his failure to maintain airspeed and his inadvertent stall during takeoff initial climb.

The pilot  had flown to a nearby field to apply fertilizer but elected to return to the airstrip behind his home due to thunderstorm activity in the immediate vicinity of the planned spray operation.  Upon arriving at the home airstrip, the pilot established an approach to land on runway 15. After touchdown, the pilot reported that he applied both brakes to stop the airplane. During the braking action the right brake suddenly failed.  He stated he was unable to stop the airplane with the left brake. With approximately 800 feet of runway surface remaining, the pilot elected to abort the landing and chose to take off. During the attempted takeoff, the airplane cleared a fence and flew under power lines. The airplane collided with trees approximately 500 feet from the runway as the pilot maneuvered to avoid a collision with his home. After the airplane collided with the trees, it rolled inverted, fell to the ground, and burst into flames. Examination of the airplane wreckage revealed that the airframe sustained extensive fire damage. Reportedly, the fire destroyed the right wheel brake assembly and it was not functionally examined. According to Piper 25-235 performance data, at the landing and stall speed of 46 mph, the landing roll at gross weight is about 850 feet.",The pilot's inadequate in-flight decision to go-around after a reported loss of right brake pressure during the landing roll resulted in the in-flight collision with trees.

The pilot had been airborne for about 15 minutes and while en route had informed FAA Charlotte departure control that he was having electrical problems, saying that he needed to ""get down nearest airport no emergency yet."".  The controller responded informing the pilot  of an airport that was about 2 miles behind him, or the Monroe Airport, which was about 6 miles ahead, which had more services. At 1730:57, the pilot reported the airport in sight, and  the controller cleared him for the visual approach, stating that that runway 23 was in use, and telling the pilot to descend at his own discretion. At 1732:05 pilot then acknowledged the controller's  communications transmission saying, ""roger two three,"" and that was the last radio communication between the controller and the pilot.  At 1735:46,  the crew of a Hawker corporate jet, N942DS, which was departing from Monroe Airport reported to FAA Air traffic Control that N4780H had just crashed, and that there was smoke and fire at the scene of the crash. Witnesses stated that they observed N4780H approach Monroe Airport from the northeast, and saw it turn to the left, beyond runway 23, about 200 yards from the end of the runway, in a left descending turn. After the initial left descending turn, the witnesses said the pilot made a right descending turn toward the runway as if to get on a left downwind approach for runway 23, and during the turn the airplane had descended below the treeline.  The witnesses said that as the airplane approached the trees it assumed a nose high pitch attitude, and they heard a noise as the bottom of the airplane slapped the trees. After the airplane slapped the trees they said the pitch attitude was increased to a near vertical pitch attitude, and airplane then pitched over nose first, and descended almost straight down, disappearing below the trees.

The pilot departed on a VFR cross-country flight in the helicopter without obtaining a weather briefing, or filing a flight plan.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed along the route of flight.  Minutes before the accident, a retired U.S. Army aviator observed the helicopter flying along an obscured ridgeline, with the helicopter's main rotors disappearing into the clouds.  The helicopter came to rest on a mountain approximately 3,200 feet high, a few miles from where the witness observed the helicopter.  The wreckage was on the northwest side of the mountain, on a slope of about 40 degrees, at an elevation of 2,610 feet.  The initial impact point was two trees side-by-side, about 10 feet apart, and perpendicular to the wreckage path.  Facing the direction of travel, the tree on the right showed a deep slash mark on the approach side of the tree, and a sharp, angular cut tree trunk remained from the tree on the left.  A corresponding, angular cut tree trunk with the top branches attached rested below the tree on the left.  Examination of the wreckage revealed no mechanical anomalies.

The fuel tanks were fueled the night before the accident date and were confirmed to be full during a preflight the morning of the accident date.  The airplane was then repositioned and flown on 10 sightseeing flights by a company pilot other than the accident pilot, all with the mixture full rich.  The fuel quantity gauges indicated decreasing quantity of fuel during the flights and the gauges indicated more than 1/2, and less then 1/4 respectively sometime during the last flight.  The accident pilot relieved the pilot who had flown the 10 sightseeing flights, at that time the airplane had been operated for 3.75 hours since fueling.  The accident pilot reported he visually checked the fuel tanks though all the adult passengers stated he did not.  The flight departed and at 200 feet msl, the pilot later stated that the engine quit when he reduced power to 25 inches manifold pressure.  He maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing in a field, and touched down with full flaps at an indicated airspeed of 80 knots.  The airplane touched down, the nose landing gear separated from the airplane, and the airplane then collided with a 6-8 feet high sand dune.  The airplane came to rest inverted on top of the sand dune.  Examination of the fuel lines at the fuel selector valve, at each reservoir fuel tank, and at the fuel control unit revealed no fuel.  No fuel was found in the auxiliary fuel pump, engine driven fuel pump, or reservoir tanks.  The fuel selector was found positioned to the right fuel tank which was calculated to contain 7 gallons of fuel; the unusable amount of fuel in the tank is 3.5 gallons.  The engine was placed on a test stand, impact damaged components were replaced or repaired and the engine was started and found to operate normally, no discrepancies were noted.  Testing of the fuel gauges revealed they were operative.  Testing of the fuel transmitters revealed several discrepancies.  The average fuel consumption over a 9-day period was 15.14 gallons per hour; the airplane had been operated for 3.79 hours since fueling at the time of the accident.  The operator had a procedure in place that required the pilot to dip the tanks during preflight and the chief pilot to randomly dip the tanks during the day; the pilot did not dip the tank before the flight and the chief pilot did not randomly dip the tanks throughout the day.  The dipstick used to dip the tanks was in fact a wooden paint stirrer with a ""full"" mark annotated.  No graduate marks beneath the full mark was noted.  The Service Manual indicates that the fuel quantity indicators and transmitters are required to be checked every 50 hours and also during a complete inspection of the airplane.  The airplane was inspected last on May 11, 2001, using an approved checklist that consisted of the inspection chart found in the Service Manual.  The airplane had accumulated 48 hours since the inspection at the time of the accident.",The loss of engine power due to fuel starvation for undetermined reasons resulting in the forced landing and subsequent on-ground collision with a sand dune with a resulting nose over.  A factor in the accident was the unsuitable terrain encountered during the forced landing.

As the airplane was taxiing to the runway, the CFI noticed a ""skip"" in the engine.  During the pre-take off run up, the left magneto was observed as running ""rough.""  The CFI increased the engine power to 2,000 RPM and leaned the mixture until the ""roughness"" was gone.  The airplane was then taxied to the runway for departure.  During the takeoff climb, about 100 to 200 feet AGL, the ""skip"" in the engine was experienced again.  With about 1/3 of the runway remaining, the CFI elected to abort the take off, and descended the airplane at a steep angle towards the runway.  The airplane impacted the runway with the nose wheel, bounced back into the air, and departed the end of the runway.  The airplane touched down a second time on the nose wheel in a grass area, flipped over and came to rest inverted.

An amateur built airplane sustained substantial damage on impact with a fence and terrain during a forced landing after takeoff following a loss of engine power encountered on initial climbout. about 300 feet above ground level.  The throttle body injector (TBI) was shipped back to the manufacturer to be re-built.  That unit was recalled 12 years earlier.  The pilot was not aware of the recall at the time of the accident.  The TBI manufacturer stated that ""during the bench check of its regulator cracking pressure and idle setting, it was determined that the inlet control valve was stuck in the closed position, a condition not unusual for a unit which had been run on automotive fuel, or one that has been stored for a period of time with standing fuel inside.  Additionally the idle needle valve was found to be fully closed.  When the regulator cover was removed to free the inlet control ball, water stains were observed over a large sector of the control diaphragm.  Removal of the inlet fuel screen revealed that it too had experienced substantial long term water contamination some time in its past.""  The TBI was reassembled and test run.

The single-engine airplane struck wires and the terrain following a loss of engine power during the takeoff/initial climb. Witness descriptions were: ""lost altitude after takeoff, flying very low, struggling, low airspeed, low rpm's, yawing to gain altitude, struggling for power, not enough forward speed to sustain flight, and yawing just above a stall.""  Witness descriptions of the engine were: ""sounded very flat, having trouble getting full revs, and cutting out.""  Witnesses observed the airplane turn left ""sharply, waver, swerve back and forth, strike a power line, dive down, gain altitude, and strike the second power line.""   Subsequently, the witnesses observed the airplane impact the ground with the left wing and spin around about 80 degrees before coming to rest.  Local authorities reported  that the left fuel tank was empty, the right fuel tank was full, and fuel was leaking from the aircraft.  Local authorities turned off switches in the cockpit and de-activated the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT).  Airport personnel reported that the fuel tanks were topped the day before the accident, with 10.3 gallons, and the accident flight was the first known flight since that refueling.  The FAA inspector reported ""no usable fuel found in the left wing tank.  No fuel found on ground under the left wing.  No dead grass.  No stained grass. No strong odor of fuel.""  The inspector reported the fuel selector had the ""left tank selected.""  The right wing tank was full.  The airframe and engine representative confirmed the integrity of the left wing fuel tank and fuel line continuity from the three fuel tanks to the fuel selector valve.  The auxiliary fuel tank was full of fuel.  The fuel pump was rotated and a few drops of fuel were found in the fuel pump lines.  No anomalies were found that would have prevented fuel flow through the fuel system.  The pilot does not have any memory of the events before or after the accident. The initial on scene response of local authorities, airport personnel, and other numerous individuals, precluded a determination of the cockpit switch positions, the fuel selector position, and the amount of fuel on board prior to the accident.",the loss of engine power due to an undetermined reason.

The airplane was in cruise flight at 6,500 feet, about 7 miles west of the airport, when the engine lost partial power.  The pilot contacted Danbury tower, proceeded direct to the airport, and circled about 1 mile west of the runway to lose altitude.  The controller provided weather information and asked the pilot if he would like to land on runway 26 or 35.  The pilot opted for runway 26 because it was longer.  Upon passing through 3,000 feet, the controller asked the pilot if he could make a left 270 degree turn, and the pilot acknowledged.  About a minute later, the pilot reported that the engine was running rough, but still producing power.  While on final approach, the pilot made s-turns, and the controller gave him the option to make another 270 degree turn to lose altitude.  On final approach, witnesses observed the airplane in a ""dramatic"" slip, and that it was too high and fast to land on the 4,422 foot long runway.  At mid-field, the airplane was still ""extremely fast"" at a height level with the control tower, about 62 feet.  Near the end of the runway, the pilot applied power to go-around, but the engine did not respond.  The airplane continued to descend and collided with a pole about a 1/4- mile from the end of runway 8.  Examination of the engine revealed that the #3 exhaust stack exhibited a 3/4-inch wide horizontal crack along the rim of the weld line.  Additionally, the pilot had a 3,135 foot long perpendicular runway available for landing.","the pilot's misjudged altitude and excessive airspeed resulting in a collision with a pole.

The airplane landed hard, porpoised down the runway, departed the runway, ground looped, and came to rest in a landfill area on its main landing gear.  The airplane had flown for about an hour the day of the accident to three different airports with no discrepancies noted.  Once established on final approach, the pilot observed the windsock indicating a crosswind condition, and felt the drift of the airplane to the left.  After slowing the airplane and correcting for the crosswind, he did not recheck his airspeed to make sure he had the appropriate airspeed for landing.  The airplane landed hard and short of the runway, and porpoised two times down the runway.  The pilot added power in an attempt to regain airplane control.  The airplane started to depart to the left of the runway, and he simultaneously became distracted by his passenger who started yelling.  The airplane traveled approximately 150 feet before the nose landing gear collapsed, and an additional 450 feet before coming to rest in a landfill area.",Failure of the pilot to maintain proper airspeed for landing and airplane control with an existing crosswind.  A contributing factor was the distraction of the pilot by a yelling passenger.

Shortly after takeoff, at about 150 feet above ground level, the engine suddenly lost power.  The pilot was unable to restart the engine and turned the aircraft toward a clearing.  The aircraft stalled just before colliding with trees and subsequently the ground.  During the engine examination, it was found that the engine driven fuel pump was loose at the base of the pump, and the splined shaft of the pump was not properly engaged in the pump.  The drive pin was not properly engaged and the snap ring securing the seal spring retainer and spring from extending beyond the end of the shaft was not secured around the end of the rotor.  A section from the end of the rotor was broken off.  Metallurgical examination of the fuel pump components revealed that the seal spring retainer snap ring was severely worn and when assembled in place on the rotor, would barely keep the seal spring retainer on the shaft end of the rotor.  The rotor fracture was typical of overstress.  The mechanic who last inspected the fuel pump reported that during the inspection of the fuel pump drive pin, he did not disassemble the components as indicated in the accomplishment instructions of a service letter by the engine manufacture that he was using nor the Service Bulletin published by the fuel pump manufacturer.   The mechanic reported that he did not remove the snap ring to gain access to the drive pin for the drive pin inspection, nor did he replace any of the fuel pump components.  The Service Bulletin, in a note under assembly of the pump, states to not reuse the snap ring.","Failure of the engine driven fuel pump due to a worn snap ring which resulted in a loss of engine power during initial climb.

The pilot was maneuvering the airplane south of the airport preparing to make a VFR approach. Witnesses observed the airplane in a right spin. NTAP data showed the airplane to be well above stall speed before disappearing from radar. Examination of the radar data revealed that in 6 seconds, ground speed dropped 31 knots, from 200 knots to 169 knots, and altitude dropped 440 feet, from 11,760 feet to 11,320 feet (4,400 feet per minute). In the next 6 seconds, ground speed dropped another 31 knots, from 169 knots to 138 knots, and altitude dropped 1,020 feet, from 11,320 feet to 10,300 feet (10,200 feet per minute). According to the manufacturer, if the throttles were to be brought back into Beta (flat pitch) range, it is possible that one propeller could go into Beta an instant before the other propeller. If this were to happen, the airplane would instantly snap roll and enter a spiral. The pilot had received an estimated 4 hours of dual instruction in the airplane.",the pilot's loss of aircraft control inflight for reasons undetermined.

The pilot stated that while taking off on runway 15, about half way down the runway, he felt a loss of engine power and noticed he was not high enough to clear the high terrain in front of him. He decided to aim for a pasture to the right of the departure end of the runway. This is the last thing he recalls. The next thing he remembers is seeing the airplane wrecked in the airport  building. After the accident the engine was placed on a test stand under the supervision of NTSB personnel. The engine was started and ran for a few seconds while producing white smoke, and then quit. The engine was again started and produced about 1,500 rpm. The engine operated roughly. The engine was shutdown and the No. 3 cylinder was found to not have an elevated temperature. The No. 3 cylinder was removed and the exhaust valve head was missing. The piston had impact damage from the exhaust valve head and a piece of the exhaust valve head was found in the cylinder. No part number was visible on the broken valve remnants. Metallurgical examination of the remnants of the No. 3 exhaust valve was performed by the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, D.C.

The pilot switched both fuel selectors from the auxiliary tanks to the main fuel tanks and started a descent by reducing power.  During the descent, the right engine lost power.  Subsequently, the left engine lost power.  The pilot performed the emergency checklist and restarted both engines.  Subsequently, the right engine again lost power.  The landing gear collapsed during the single-engine landing, and the airplane exited the runway.  The pilot stated that the ""fuel selector valve failed to seal poppet valves internally, resulting in no fuel to right engine.  Landing gear did not fully deploy on approach.""  Impact damage to the main landing gear assembly precluded a determination of the reason for the collapse of the landing gear; however, the motor operated when power was applied.  During disassembly of the right fuel selector valve, the three Rulon-A seals were found depressed (stuck in the downed position) level with the housing, and the spring follower bushings for all three seals were missing.

During a forced landing the left wing struck a light standard pole, and the airplane came to rest inverted after colliding with a fence.  The purpose of the flight was to conduct recurrent training to include emergency procedures.  On the accident flight the certified flight instructor (CFI) initiated a simulated engine failure after takeoff during the initial climb out.  The student advised the tower, and turned crosswind at 700 feet agl.  The student set up for landing, which included lowering the landing gear and adding 10 degrees of flaps.  On short final, descending through 400 feet agl, both the CFI and student realized they would not make the runway.  Both pilot's advanced the throttle, to arrest the descent and perform a go-around.  There was no corresponding response from the engine.  During the final stages of the emergency descent, the pilot maneuvered the airplane to avoid a work crew at the airport boundary fence and the airplane collided with the light standard pole and a fence.  An airframe and engine examination discovered no discrepancies with any system.  Following documentation of the engine and related systems it was removed and installed in an instrumented engine test cell for a functional test.  The engine started without hesitation and was operated for 44 minutes at various factory new engine acceptance test points.  During acceleration response tests, technicians rapidly advanced the throttle to the full open position, and the engine accelerated with no hesitation.  A second acceleration response test produced the same results.  According to Textron Lycoming, there were no discrepancies that would have precluded the engine from being capable of producing power.",a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.  Also causal was the inadequate supervision of the flight by the CFI for allowing a simulated emergency maneuver to continue below an altitude which would not allow for recovery contingencies.

The aircraft collided with terrain during a night cross-country dual instructional flight.  Prior to the flight, the student obtained an abbreviated weather briefing.  A preflight specialist advised, ""VFR flight was not recommended"" along a portion of the planned flight route.  Along the planned route of flight multiple scattered to broken cloud layers were forecast from 2,000 feet msl to 6,500 feet, with few clouds at 1,000 feet, and tops at 8,000 feet.  The student filed a flight plan for cruise flight at an altitude of 3,000 feet msl between islands.  The accident site was at 1,760 feet msl.  The flight departed its home base about 1945.  Sunset was at 1910, and the end of civil twilight was 1934.  During an en route contact with an FAA Automated Flight Service Station, the student asked if the filed destination airport was public or private.  The specialist advised the student that it was a private airport.  The student cancelled the flight plan, and indicated that they were returning to the departure airport.  The student pilot was flying the airplane and as weather conditions deteriorated, the certified flight instructor (CFI) advised the student to make a right turn.  Instead, the student made a left, descending turn into a cloud.  The CFI took control of the airplane, and initiated a climb; however, the airplane impacted the ground.

No discrepancies were noted during the preflight; the oil capacity was 9 quarts.  Additionally, there was no report of an engine malfunction either during engine start, taxi, or during the engine run-up before takeoff.  After takeoff following the first power reduction, the pilot later reported that the engine made a loud bang, and the rpm indicated zero though the propeller was rotating.  Unable to return, she ditched the airplane and all occupants escaped.  Examination of the engine revealed no crankshaft continuity to the accessory section.  Disassembly of the engine revealed that the crankshaft was fractured at the No. 3 crankshaft cheek; metallurgical examination revealed fatigue.  There was no bearing in the No. 2 main bearing position in the crankcases, pieces of it were found in the oil sump.  Additionally, a bolt for the No. 2 cylinder connecting rod was fractured near the bolt head.  Metallurgical examination of the bearing pieces and of the fractured connecting rod bolt revealed overstress on the undamaged fracture surfaces, and features consistent with bending shear separation, respectively.  Metallurgical examination of the crankcase halves revealed brown to black deposists at all cylinder mounting surfaces; the deposits are consistent with corrosion and fretting products.  Additionally, fretting and polishing were noted in several areas of both crankcase halves.  The No. 2 main bearing saddle area was noted to be, ""...severely damaged with large rolled edges formed at the forward and rear edges....""  The engine was rebuilt by Teledyne Continental Motors, on August 23, 1988, and installed in the airplane on October 1, 1988.

The pilot was giving rides to some guests at his residence.  He completed two trips without incident.  However, on the third flight, after takeoff, and about a mile from the runway, he initiated a turn to the left.  The angle of bank continued to increase until the wings were nearly vertical, and the nose dropped below the horizon.  The airplane disappeared from view behind a tree line, as it was descending nose-down and turning to the left.  Impact damage on the leading edges of both wings was consistent with a left rotation at impact.  Fuel was found in the carburetor, and the metal leading edges of both wooden propeller blades were bent rearward.  No evidence of a pre-existing mechanical failure or malfunction was found.  The pilot was seated in the rear seat.  All flight and engine instrument were located in front of the front seat occupant only.","The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane, which resulted in an inadvertent stall/spin to the ground.

The pilot departed in a helicopter with seven passengers, on a night VFR cross-country flight under FAR 135, into known deteriorating weather conditions.  About 35 minutes after departure, while maneuvering in IMC conditions, the helicopter struck trees, and came to rest about 735 feet from initial tree contact.  The flight had been one of two helicopters that had carried passengers to the departure airport.  The pilot of the other helicopter made three contacts with flight service for weather briefings, and relayed his finding to the accident pilot.  The briefings included VFR flight not recommended, and deteriorating weather.  The company operations manual called for a minimum weather of a 500 foot ceiling and 1 mile visibility, and that to operate VFR, the pilot had to have visual surface reference.  The pilot reported that he entered IMC conditions and was attempting to perform a precautionary landing when the tail rotor struck a tree.  The pilot also reported that after the accident, he estimated the ceiling was about 100 feet high and the visibility was about 1 mile at the accident site.  Radar data tracked the flight as the pilot maneuvered between 300 feet MSL, and 1,300 feet MSL, and then descended toward a nearby airport. However, due to terrain, there was no radar of the last portion of the flight.  A pilot rated passenger seated in the front row, reported the pilot entered into IMC conditions, and maneuvered in IMC conditions for several minutes.  He also said the helicopter was in IMC conditions, in cruise flight when it struck trees.  The departure weight exceeded the maximum allowable takeoff weight by about  115 pounds and also exceeded the forward CG limit.  Additionally, the passengers reported no pre-departure passenger briefing had been conducted.","the pilot's improper decision to continue flight in instrument meteorological conditions, and which resulted in an in-flight collision with trees.

As the airplane departed from the runway, the pilot deployed the tow hook and climbed to 150 feet.  The pilot then ""sidestepped"" to the right of the runway to pick up the banner, which was set up on the grass about half way down the runway.  The pilot ""crossed the pickup rope at too slow of an airspeed, approximately 55-60 MPH, versus a normal target speed of approximately 70 to 80 MPH.""  The pilot then pitched the airplane upward, catching the rope with the tow hook, and soon realized that ""there were problems in climbing out.""   After about 5 seconds, the pilot considered releasing the banner, but decided against the idea, due to releasing the banner on a crossing runway.  After clearing the runway area, the pilot released the banner, about 100 feet above the ground, ""and in an incipient stall attitude.""  Unable to climb, and not enough altitude to gain any additional airspeed, the pilot began to raise and lower the nose of the airplane to avoid a stall.  As the pilot maneuvered the airplane to an open parking lot for a forced landing, the airplane struck power lines and impacted a utility pole, shearing off the right wing.

While on final and approximately 600 feet agl, the student pilot decided that the airplane was not in a position to safely continue the approach.  He initiated a go-around, selected the carburetor heat to ""OFF,"" and applied full power.  By the time the airplane was approximately half way down the runway, the pilot had retracted the flaps, and initiated a climb.  A couple of seconds into the climb and without warning, the engine lost power.  The pilot executed a forced landing, by making a 360 degree turn.  The airplane touched down long, fast, and on the grass to the right of the runway.  It then impacted some trees before coming to a stop.  Examination of the airplane revealed that both fuel tanks had approximately 5 gallons of fuel.  An engine run was then preformed.  The engine started and ran smoothly.  Engine rpm was limited to 1,200 because of propeller damage.  A magneto check was preformed at 1,200 rpm, and engine rpm dropped approximately 100 rpm for both magnetos.  After securing the engine, the fuel line between the gascolator and carburetor was disconnected, and the electric-driven fuel pump was activated.  Initially, fuel was expelled a ""normal"" rate, but then slowed.  The fuel flow then oscillated between ""normal"" and a reduced rate.  The fuel screen was found absent of debris.

The pilot was employed by Omega Protein, Inc., to spot fish while flying and relay that information to fishing boats.  The accident pilot and another company pilot departed about the same time in separate airplanes from the same airport for the purpose of fish spotting.  Another company pilot departed from another airport about the same time for the same purpose.  About 1 hour 40 minutes after the accident flight departed, an unknown company pilot asked the accident pilot his location; he responded that he was east of a location called Cat Island, and he wanted to make a motion to stop fish spotting for the duration of the shift.  The pilot who had departed with the accident pilot reported that the accident pilot's voice during this transmission was ""weak"" sounding.  Both other company pilots reported that it was discussed to return due to the inability to see fish.  The pilot who departed from the separate airport returned to his departure airport.  The pilot who had departed with the accident pilot initially elected to attempt to spot fish for a boat that was heading south of the fleet of boats being spotted by him and the accident pilot.  He then returned to near the fleet and attempted to establish radio communications with the accident pilot; but was unsuccessful.  A pilot-rated witness who was located approximately 4-5 blocks east of the crash site reported seeing an airplane flying no more than 400 feet above ground level airplane heading north or northwest bound.

The airplane was destroyed on impact with terrain and post impact fire following an in-flight break up while maneuvering in the traffic pattern.  The pilot and rear seat passenger were fatally injured.  The accident airplane was cleared for a low approach.  A record of interview with the Air Traffic Control Tower Chief stated ""that when the aircraft was in front of the tower he first noticed a short vapor trail coming from the left wing tip and shortly thereafter the wing tip tank separated.""  A witness stated, ""At approximately midway down the runway the aircraft began a 5 to 10 degrees climb at which point I observed the left wing tip fuel tank and what appeared to be a small section of the wing separate from the aircraft and smash through the tail section, which also became separated.""  Flight control push-pull link-rods were traced and continuity was established from the cockpits to the flight controls surfaces.  The left wing was separated from the fuselage. Sections of the v-tail were found on runway 21.  Both tip tanks were found in the grass area after the end of runway 21 and they were separated from their wings.  The NTSB Materials Laboratory report stated, ""Both of the [tip tank rear] studs were fractured flush with the exterior surfaces of the tip tanks.  Examination of the fractures through the studs revealed similar features on the fractures from both tip tanks.  ...  Both fractures contained two diametrically opposite regions that were lighter in color and contained crack arrest positions, typical of reverse bending fatigue.

The pilot said that he was approximately 20 miles south of Cambridge, Nebraska, at 6,500 feet mean sea level when his engine began to run rough and the airplane began to lose altitude.  The pilot said he immediately turned toward the airport and declared an emergency.  The pilot said he planned to land on runway 32 because he estimated the winds were out of the southwest.  As he approached the airport, the pilot realized he was high and made a right 360 degree turn to lose altitude.  The pilot said he was still high after the turn and decided his best option was to land on runway 14.  When he turned on final for runway 14, the pilot realized that he was on a downwind approach.   He decided that he had no option but to continue.  The pilot said he had great difficulty getting the plane on the runway and bounced a couple of times.  The pilot said it became apparent to him that he was not going to stop on the runway.  ""I decided to try to divert to [a] plowed field to the left of the runway ...

The pilot said the purpose of the flight was to experiment with ballast added to the helicopter.  He said that in its normal configuration, the helicopter tended to ascend and descend from a hover in a left-skid low attitude.  The pilot said that with the proper placement of ballast, the center-of-gravity could be adjusted to attain a more wings-level attitude during takeoffs and landings to and from a hover.  The pilot placed the ballast weight on the pad to the right of the helicopter prior to engine start.  He said he intended to fly one trip around the traffic pattern, land the helicopter, set the throttle at idle, de-plane, install the ballast weight, then fly the helicopter around the pattern to note the difference in helicopter attitude in both hovering and forward flight.  During the initial takeoff to a hover, the helicopter drifted right, struck the weight, and rolled over onto its side.

The homebuilt experimental airplane was approaching its destination airport after a cross country flight of 3 hours 12 minutes duration when it lost engine power.  The airline transport pilot reported to air traffic control that he was not going to make it to the airport and was going to crash.  The airplane impacted trees and terrain about 2 miles from the airport.  The FAA inspector, who responded to the accident site, reported the right fuel tank was empty, the left fuel tank was compromised by impact damage, and the fuel selector was on the left tank.  A post accident examination of the engine revealed no preaccident anomalies.  Examination of the right wing fuel tank revealed that a required fuel vent was not drilled into the spar.  According to the builder of another experimental airplane of this design, the lack of the vent would have made filling the tank problematic as the affected section of the tank had no way to vent, and therefore,  it would have been difficult to completely fill the tank, and there would have been no way to confirm how much fuel was in the tank.  The owner of the airplane reported he had previously experienced problems getting the fuel tanks to accept the total designed fuel capacity of 80 gallons; however, he and the pilot believed this problem had been fixed.  Additionally, a few days prior to the accident, the pilot had taken the airplane to a maintenance facility to correct several discrepancies, one of which was ""problems with the fuel quantity indicating system.""  A mechanic reported that the pilot told him he had been flying for several weeks with neither of the fuel quantity indicators working properly.  After examining the airplane, the mechanic told the pilot that the airplane's right fuel quantity sender was not calibrated properly and the left fuel quantity sender was defective and would have to be replaced.  The pilot elected to defer the repairs to the fuel quantity indicating system until he arrived at his final destination.","the builder's failure to install a fuel compartment vent in the right wing, affecting the total available fuel capacity, and resulting in the loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.

The helicopter flight manual states, ""... The effects of wind on take-off and landings are important factors and should be considered in the operation of the helicopter; however, in planning critical helicopter operations, the effects of winds can be relied upon to assist in accomplishing landings and take-offs from unobstructed areas.  If the helicopter were riding a gust of wind on the final approach and the gust should decrease as the helicopter was approaching a hover, the helicopter would probably rapidly 'settle' if the wind factor was planned on to execute the landing.  This condition would also hold true during the initial phase of take-off. ... Another effect of wind that must be considered is the 'lee' effect of the wind over hills, ridges, and obstacles.  The downdrafts resulting from these conditions particularly affect the initial phase of take-off or the final phase of landing.""  A postaccident examination of the helicopter and accident site was conducted.  The helicopter was found facing in a northerly direction in an open, flat, unobstructed field.  There were buildings to the south of the field.  No anomalies were found with respect to the helicopter.

The commercial certificated pilot was on a VFR cross-country positioning flight to his home airport.  As the airplane was in cruise flight about 500 feet above the ground, the engine surged about three to four times.  The pilot activated the electric fuel boost pump, and switched fuel tanks, even though each fuel tank contained adequate fuel. The engine quit, and the pilot selected an emergency landing area in soft, marshy terrain.  The airplane received damage to the nose gear, the engine firewall, the left landing gear, the right landing gear, and the right wing.  A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the engine had accrued about 500 hours since an overhaul.  Each fuel tank contained fuel.  The electric fuel pump produced pressure.  Opening of the throttle produced only a momentary increase in fuel pressure.  After several attempts, the engine started and ran at an idle.  The engine maintenance records indicated the engine driven fuel pump had been replaced twice since the overhaul.  Each fuel pump installed on the engine by the operator since the engine overhaul was tested for proper operation.  Each produced fuel pressure.  The engine fuel servo was removed and tested for proper operation.  During fuel flow testing, the fuel servo produced a lean fuel mixture at a mid-range power setting.  The servo, bearing the overhaul facilities coil loc lead seal, was disassembled after the flow check.  The examination revealed the brass idle plug/main metering valve had part number 2541461 stamped on opposite sides of the vertical surface of the valve.  One of the part numbers had been obliterated by a marking tool, and the number 2537665 etched on the valve with a hand marking tool.  Part number 2537665 is the correct component for the model of servo.  The valve appeared to a hand modified 2541461 which has a different metering jet placement than that of the correct 2537665 valve.  The hand modification was produced by several punch tool indentations around the edges of the jet hole on both sides of the valve body.  The indentations had hanging burrs protruding into the jet hole.","A malfunction of the engine fuel control due to an improper overhaul by other maintenance personnel, and subsequent loss of engine power during cruise flight.

The student pilot was flying a practice NDB approach to runway 34.  The instructor said they began descending during the procedure turn.  They rolled out on  the inbound heading of 354 degrees.  The instructor pilot said, ""I called Omaha approach and they approved a switch to Plattsmouth advisory.""  While he changed radio frequencies, the student pilot descended to the minimum descent altitude of 1,820 feet mean sea level.  At 7 DME the instructor made the radio call to Plattsmouth advisory.  The student pilot performed his pre-landing checklist at 5 DME.  The gear came down, and the student pilot told the instructor pilot that he turned on the boost pump and switched tanks.  The instructor pilot said he did not actually see him do this, but looked over and saw the fuel pump on and the fuel selector switched over to the left tank.  The engine instruments all looked normal.  At 1.8 DME, the instructor pilot said the manifold pressure and RPMs dropped, and the airplane nosed down.  The instructor pilot pushed the control levers full forward and told the student pilot to run the emergency checklist.  ""...our speed was still only about 80 and it was obvious we were not going to make the runway.  We picked up a little speed, but even best glide wouldn't get us to the runway - we were too low for that.  The instructor pilot said he looked for the best possible landing site straight ahead between us and the runway.  The instructor pilot moved the throttle up and down twice.  He said that it seemed very loose.  There was no response from the engine.  The engine sounded like it was still running.  The instructor pilot said they kept the flaps up so they could stretch the glide to clear a tree line.  On the other side of the tree line they saw a fence with large fence posts in their path.  ""We both got on the controls and pulled us over the fence.  On the other side the terrain angled up.  We flared, the stall warning sounded, the mains hit the ground and then it seemed like the nose wheel hit hard.""  An examination of the airplane at the accident site revealed no anomalies.  The engine was examined 8 days later and showed no anomalies.","the loss of engine power for undetermined reasons during the approach and the inadvertent stall that occurred during the forced landing.

The accident pilot preflighted the airplane which had about 1/4 to 1/3 fuel capacity.  The wind was from the west-northwest at 5-10 miles per hour (mph); the flight towing a glider departed from the westerly oriented runway.  The glider pilot stated that after liftoff the tow pilot remained in ground effect and the tow plane drifted over to the left side of the runway and hit the top of a small scrub oak that was about 15ft high and 1000 ft before the end of the runway.  The glider pilot also stated that the accident pilot set up a normal climb attitude and about 70 mph to about 250 feet above ground level (agl).  At that point, ""...we encountered heavy sink/downdraft, with some turbulence which suddenly dropped us about 100ft.  Noting this condition, I released the tow rope from the glider and terminated the tow.  At this time, I heard the Bucker's engine running and it sounded strong.  I then turned right and [the towplane] continued to drift and turn slightly left which is also where a line of about 100ft pine trees are located about 1000ft from the end of the runway.""  The glider pilot also stated, ""About 10 seconds later, I saw that [the towplane] was still in a climb attitude and in sink.  I saw him appear to release the rope from the Bucker and then clip the top of the tallest tree.  He then seemed to snap roll to the left and into the ground.""  Examination of the airplane at the accident site by an FAA inspector revealed no evidence of flight control preimpact failure or malfunction.  The airplane was recovered and a replacement propeller was installed for the engine run.  The engine started and was operated to an estimated 1,000 rpm but could not accelerate; impact damage was noted to the servo fuel injector (servo).

A certificated commercial pilot, an Alaska State Trooper, departed from a remote lake in a float-equipped airplane, as the second airplane in a flight of two airplanes.  When the accident airplane failed to arrive at the intended destination, the first pilot initiated an aerial search.  The airplane wreckage was discovered about a quarter-mile southeast of the departure lake.  The first pilot recalled having a conversation with the accident pilot concerning the use of the Cub Crafters main fuel valve installed in the accident airplane.  He said that the accident pilot commented that he was not flying the airplane normally assigned to him, which had the original Piper main fuel tank selector valve installed.  The accident pilot told the first pilot that he was unsure if the accident airplane's fuel selector valve should be operated in the BOTH position or the LEFT or RIGHT positions.  The FAA approved Cub Crafters STC requires the addition of a placard, placed just above the main fuel valve, which states: ""TAKE OFF AND LANDING ON BOTH ONLY.""  The accident airplane had the placard installed.  During an on-scene inspection of the airplane wreckage, the fuel selector valve was found selected to the LEFT fuel tank setting, and the left fuel tank was empty.  A review of the State of Alaska, Department of Public Safety's ""aircraft manual,"" which outlines general operating policies and standards, disclosed that there were no provisions for differences training for the Cub Crafters fuel system.","The pilot's selection of the incorrect fuel tank, subsequent fuel starvation, and inadvertent stall during initial climb.

The pilot took off at about 0935 pacific daylight time.   At 0945, the pilot had advised the radar controller that he was returning to the departure airport, and he stated that he was not feeling well.  A minute later, during a subsequent transmission, the controller asked the pilot if he was feeling any better.  The pilot's answer was unintelligible.  Thereafter, at 0950, the pilot stated ""Tower, get an ambulance to the field.""  Several eyewitnesses observed the airplane approaching the airport at a low altitude.  As the airplane descended it entered a steep left bank and collided into the side of a parked truck.  The airplane came to rest about 3.3 nm from the airport.  In 1999, the manager of the FAA Aeromedical Certification Division had reviewed the pilot's medical information, which revealed a history of congestive heart failure and other ailments.  The FAA determined the pilot was ineligible for issuance of a third-class aviation medical certificate.  However upon the pilot's submission of additional medical information, the FAA granted authorization for special issuance of the requested third-class medical certificate.  The certificate was subsequently renewed, and at the time of the accident it bore an expiration date of August 31, 2001.  In the autopsy report the deputy medical examiner indicated that the ""history of severe cardiac dysfunction and the findings of severe arteriosclerosis and myocardial scarring and granulation tissue suggest that the [the pilot's] incapacitation was likely due to an acute cardiac event.""",Loss of control in flight due to cardiovascular incapacitation.

During the missed approach the engine lost power, was maneuvered to land, and came to rest inverted after the nose wheel touched down in soft dirt.  The purpose of the flight was to conduct instrument training at local area airports.  The flight had departed home base approximately an hour away from the accident airport.  No discrepancies were noted with the engine during the flight or the approach to land.  As the student reached MDA the CFI instructed the student to conduct the missed approach.  They climbed straight ahead to 500 feet msl and initiated a left-hand turn for compliance with the missed approach procedure.  The engine began to lose power.  The CFI declared an emergency and conducted the emergency checklist.  She turned towards the runway and slipped the airplane down land on the runway.  Due to the altitude, she knew they would not make the runway, so she attempted to land in a grassy area past the departure end of the runway.  Again, the airplane was too high for landing and she had to maneuver to avoid the airport perimeter fence.  The CFI turned away from the fence.  When she returned the airplane to wings level flight the wheels touched down.  The nose wheel dug into the soft dirt and the airplane flipped over.  Examination of the engine revealed that the exhaust push rod housing and exhaust push rod were bent.  The crankshaft was manually rotated establishing valve training continuity.  No further discrepancies were noted with the engine.",Loss of engine power due to the restricted movement of the number 1 exhaust valve that subsequently bent the exhaust push rod and push rod housing.

The pilot was flying a twin engine helicopter that was lightly loaded.  He was flying in close proximity to a  helipad, waiting for another helicopter to leave the pad, when he reported he had a loss of engine power in the number two engine.  Although the helicopter's operations manual specified that the helicopter was easily capable of sustaining flight, and even of initiating a rate of climb somewhere  between 550 and 700 feet per minute, the pilot elected to make an immediate landing into a confined area.  During the descent, the helicopter collided with trees, and sustained substantial damage.   An examination of the engines disclosed that an improper bleed air flow jet was left installed in the engine's automatic fuel control unit (AFCU), contrary to a service bulletin from the manufacturer.  The presence of the air flow jet resulted in a substandard fuel flow pressure, and the potential for a loss of engine power.","The pilot's selection of an unsuitable landing site following a partial loss of power during approach to landing in a multiengine helicopter.

The pilot said, ""On roll out [I] noticed [a] drainage ditch and tried to maneuver to avoid it, but [the] RT gear went over the edge and [the] plane came to [an] abrupt stop.""  An examination of the airplane's fuel tanks showed right fuel tank empty and the left fuel tank full of fuel.  The screens in the two fuel pick-up ports in the left fuel tank were completely blocked with debris.  No other anomalies with the airplane were found.  Later examination of the fuel pick-up fittings and finger screens revealed the debris to be hardened mud and mulch similar to that found in nests made by wasps. The airplane underwent an annual inspection 6 days before the accident.  The airplane was flown to American Champion, Rochester, Wisconsin, to have new wings installed 3 days before the accident.  Annual inspection criteria calls for the finger strainers in the pick-up fittings to be pulled and inspected for screen damage and debris.  At the factory, the fuel pick-up fittings were determined serviceable and re-installed in the new wings' fuel tanks.  According to the owner/pilot, the airplane flew 8 hours between the annual inspection and the accident.","Unsuitable terrain for landing encountered by the pilot during the forced landing attempt.  Factors relating to this accident were fuel starvation caused by foreign material blocking the fuel tank lines which led to the engine failure, annual inspection criteria not complied with, and the ditch."

The airplane taxied to the active runway, and departed with approximately 15 to 20 gallons of fuel in each main tank and approximately 5 gallons of fuel in each tip tank.  Between 800 and 1,000 feet agl, the pilot retracted the flaps, selected the electric-driven fuel pump to off, set manifold pressure to 25 inches of mercury, reduced propeller RPM to 2,500, and  leaned the mixture control to 18 GPH.  While operating on the right main fuel tank, and climbing through 2,800 to 3,000 feet over the water, the pilot experienced a sudden loss of engine power.  He described the change as if the propeller rpm had gone from low pitch to high pitch.  He added that the propeller continued to rotate at 2,300 rpm, and engine manifold pressure stabilized around 15 to 17 inches of mercury.  The pilot set the mixture control to full rich and placed the electric-driven fuel pump to ""ON,"" but the engine did not recover.  The pilot changed the fuel selector from the right-main tank to the left-main tank, and then waited, but still the engine did not recover.  During the descent the engine and system instruments were in the normal operating range.  The pilot pulled the throttle control all the way out, and manifold pressure dropped to 10 to 12 inches of mercury.  He then pushed it pack in, and the manifold pressure returned to 15 to 17 inches.

Using considerable force, the CFI maintained airplane control and landed without additional incident.  Thereafter, the airplane was inspected.  Evidence of mechanical binding to the elevator pitch control cables was noted.  Specifically, a screwdriver was found wedged between the nose gear actuator retract rod and the elevator control cables beneath the forward spar cover, between and under the pilots' seats.  When the nose gear retracted, the nose gear actuator retract rod moved the screwdriver against the elevator control cable resulting in binding.  Upon removal of the screwdriver, the elevator operation was normal.  Two days prior to the incident, a contract mechanic had performed maintenance on the airplane.  The maintenance required taking off the forward spar cover to allow removal and installation of a flap motor gearbox assembly and flap flex drives.  Since this maintenance, the airplane had been operated 5.8 flight hours.","During landing approach, mechanical binding of the elevator control cable occurred due to a contract mechanic's improper maintenance."

While attempting a touch-and-go landing in an aircraft that had not been flown for over 13 years, the pilot allowed the aircraft to land hard and balloon back into the air. During the following climb-out, the aircraft's engine began to lose power. The pilot then tried to execute a teardrop return to the airstrip, but realized he would not be able to reach it. He therefore attempted to put the aircraft down in a nearby grain field, but the aircraft stall/mushed into the terrain when the pilot allowed the airspeed to get too low while trying to stretch the glide. The investigation determined that solid contaminants that had accumulated in the fuel system over the thirteen year period of inactivity  were dislodged by the hard landing, and subsequently restricted the fuel flow to the engine. Although the pilot had taken a sample of fuel from the gasculator, he did not visually inspect the fuel tanks, carburetor bowl, or the interior of the gasculator.","The pilot's failure to maintain an airspeed above stall velocity (Vs) during his attempt to stretch a reduced power forced landing glide.

The helicopter impacted the ground, bounced, and impacted the ground a second time during a practice autorotation.  The commercial/student pilot was practicing a 180-degree autorotation with a power recovery when an excessive rate of descent developed.  The flight instructor said he ""joined"" the student on the controls and initiated a progressive rollout of the turn while simultaneously applying aft cyclic, raising the collective, and applying more power for a power recovery to level flight.  The instructor said that the engine did not respond to the throttle input.  Due to the rate of descent, the flight instructor elected not to attempt an ""aggressive"" flare ""fearing a tail rotor ground strike.""  He continued with aft cyclic input and collective manipulation to reduce forward airspeed and rate of descent for a run-on landing.  The helicopter contacted the ground in a ""near skids level attitude"" approximately 30 knots, with the rotor rpm in the ""high end of the green region.""  The helicopter became airborne approximately 8-10 feet above the ground.  The flight instructor indicated that the throttle was still unresponsive.  He raised the collective to cushion the second impact and the low rotor rpm warning light and horn came on prior to set down.  The helicopter impacted the ground again approximately 20 knots, collapsing the left skid.  The helicopter then rolled to the left and came to rest on its left side facing approximately 180 degrees from the approach heading.  A post-accident examination of the helicopter revealed no anomalies, with the exception of a failed left seat restraining system.  An engine test run was conducted and no anomalies were noted that would have affected its operation.","the student's excessive rate of descent during a practice autorotation, and, the inadequate use of the rotorcraft flight controls by both pilots during the attempted recovery, which resulted in a hard landing.

The aircraft collided with grapevines and supporting trellises during a forced landing following a loss of engine power.  According to the pilot, his passenger fueled the airplane prior to departure.  They purposely waited until after they ate lunch and immediately before departure to refuel the airplane in order to obtain the maximum quantity of cool fuel.  The passenger had flown about 40 photo missions with the pilot and was aware of the importance of fueling the airplane to maximum capacity.  He assured the pilot that the fuel tanks were completely full.  The accident occurred 3 hours 34 minutes after departure.  The pilot stated that during recovery, 1/2-gallon of fuel was found in the airplane.  The pilot also told the Safety Board investigator that he routinely flew the airplane 4 hours to 4 hours 5 minutes and it would require 20- to 20.5-gallons fuel to fill the tanks.  The airplane holds 26 gallons fuel, of which 22.5 are usable fuel.  The engine was test run and started promptly and ran smoothly.  The magneto check and carburetor heat check were normal.  The engine did not stop when the mixture control was moved to the idle cutoff position.  The inspection revealed that the mixture control arm was loose on its shaft.  The carburetor was examined and the mixture control valve stem shaft was found bent and was not inserted into the sleeve in the bowl.  According to the representative from the carburetor manufacturer, the carburetor operates in the ""full rich"" condition at all times when the stem is not inserted in the sleeve and subsequent movement of the mixture control would have no effect.  The examination also revealed that the mixture control lever was loose on the shaft and the stop peg traveled beyond the idle cutoff stop pad.  The pilot/operator reported that no recent maintenance had been performed on the carburetor.","A bent mixture control valve stem shaft in the carburetor which  made pilot control of the mixture inoperative resulting in excessive fuel consumption, and subsequent loss of engine power.."

The pilot made an off airport forced landing on a dirt road following a loss of engine power 2 miles east of Linden, California.  The right wing tip collided with a fence post, the airplane departed the road to the right, and continued through a fence until it came to rest.  The nose gear and right main gear collapsed; the right wing sustained substantial damage.  The flight had been uneventful and the pilot was preparing to enter the landing pattern at Stockton, his home field.  He had been operating on the auxiliary tip tanks while in cruise at 2,500 feet at a power setting of 2,150 rpm and less than 22 inches of manifold pressure.  The airplane began to slow as the pilot maintained altitude, and he detected a loss of engine power.  He switched to the left main tank, which held about 25 gallons of fuel.  He noted the engine speed remained steady at 1,100 rpm.  He selected the full rich position of the mixture control and cycled the ignition switch.  The engine did not respond so he declared an emergency with the air traffic control tower.  He set up for a left traffic pattern on the dirt road.  During the post accident examination, the throttle and mixture linkages operated through their full range of travel without any slippage of the cables.  There was no fuel in the line to the carburetor when it was disconnected; however, fuel flowed with operation of the fuel pump.  Fuel was in each tank.  The wings were removed in the recovery process, and the airplane was taken to a recovery facility for further examination.  The recovery agent plumbed a fuel can into the left wing supply line.  The agent started the engine and let it run at idle power.  He advanced the engine to 1,700 rpm and completed a magneto check.  The Safety Board investigator noted a 200 rpm drop on both magnetos, and the engine ran smoothly throughout the check.  The agent attempted to cycle the propeller, but it did not respond.  He advanced the engine to 2,300 rpm, and the investigator noted all instruments remained within the green operating band on each instrument's face.

During the glider flight, the pilot determined that he lacked sufficient lift to return to his home airport, and he selected an off-airport landing site.  The pilot stated he was aware of the trees and wires along his planned approach path, and determined that they would not be a factor.  The pilot said that as he maneuvered towards his landing site, he abbreviated and steepened his approach in an effort to touchdown in the first one-third of the field.  Just prior to touchdown, the left wing struck a tree, and the glider impacted terrain.  According to the pilot, ""I set up for an abbreviated approach when I really didn't need to.  I rushed the approach and I was high on my base and turn to final.  I knew the trees were there, but I really didn't see them as a factor.  If I were 2 feet to the right and 3 feet higher, we wouldn't be having this conversation.  I just didn't see the obstacle.""",the pilot's inadequate altitude/clearance from a tree along his final approach path.

The helicopter experienced a rough running engine on short final approach and entered an autorotation, but made a hard landing and sustained substantial damage.  The crankshaft failed as the result of fatigue cracking initiated by surface damage and localized overheating.  The crankshaft was reportedly overhauled 165 hours prior to the failure.  Optical examinations of the fracture faces found beach marks and crack arrest lines indicative of fatigue cracking though the majority of the crank cheek.  Further examinations established that the fatigue initiated at two origins on the aft radius surface of the No. 3 main bearing journal about halfway between the journal and cheek surfaces.  An oil stain covered the aft radius and cleaning revealed wide spread surface damage to the radius.  The presence of an oil stain on top of the damage indicates that the damage occurred either during the overhaul or soon there after and was not a result of the failure.  The damage extended from the journal surface up to the level of the origin area and completely around the journal.  The surface damage consisted of circumferential scoring, intermittent tearing, and material flow.  The radius also had a slight bronze hue.  Further cleaning and inspections found similar damage and coloration on the forward radius of the No. 3 main bearing but no damage to other journal radii.  The direct visual examination of the No. 3 main bearing journal surface showed heavy circumferential scoring and roughening but no visual indications of overheating.  The majority of the other journals, both rod and main, also displayed similar scoring but to lesser degrees.  Measurements established that the diameters of all main bearing journals were between 2.238 and 2.240 inches.  All rod journals measured 1.927 inches in diameter.  Conversations with a distributor for new Franklin engines indicated that standard bearing sizes for 6A-335 engines are 2.250 to 2.249 inches for mains and 1.9375 to 1.9365 inches for rods.  Bearings for 0.010- and 0.020-inch undersize journals are available for both the main and rod journals.  The measurements on the fractured crankshaft are consistent with 0.010 inch under size journals for both the mains and rods.  The presence of a white layer along with the undersized journals does indicate that the crankshaft had been renitrided at some point in time.  The Franklin 6V-335 was originally certificated in 1956.  The type certificate is now held by iyPZL-RzeszowlÈ (PZL) of Poland.",The engine crankshaft's failure as the result of fatigue cracking initiated by surface damage and localized overheating due to the installation at overhaul of incorrectly sized bearings.

The pilot started the engine, taxied to runway 24, and performed a magneto check.  No anomalies were observed, and he initiated a takeoff roll.  However, the engine began to run rough, and the pilot aborted the takeoff.  He then ran the engine at different RPM, and performed a second satisfactory magneto check.  During the second takeoff roll, the engine ran rough again, and the pilot aborted the takeoff.  The pilot then let the engine run for 5 minutes at different RPM, and it passed a third magneto check.  On the third takeoff attempt, the engine ""had good power,"" but as the airplane climbed above the trees, the engine lost all power and the pilot performed a forced landing into trees.  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the right-side muffler baffling was mostly disintegrated, consistent with a baffling failure and subsequent blockage of the engine exhaust.  The muffler baffling was required to be inspected for cracks and wear during the annual inspection of the airplane.  The last annual inspection of the airplane was performed about 3 months and 2 weeks prior to the accident, and the airplane had accumulated approximately 28 hours of operation since that inspection.",A baffling failure within the exhaust system.  Factors were an inadequate annual inspection and the pilot's operation of the airplane with known deficiencies in equipment.

When the pilot slowed the airplane and extended the landing gear, he heard the usual loud aerodynamic noise and observed three green lights indicating the landing gear was down and locked. Instead of touching down on its wheels, the airplane landed wheels up. Postaccident inspection revealed all three wheels were in their respective wheel wells. The main landing gear doors were partially open, and there was hydraulic pressure on the right inboard door. The landing gear control was confirmed to be in the DOWN position. The landing gear UP RELAY was hot to the touch. What appeared to be the beginning of a mouse nest was noted in the center console where the gear, flap, starter, and power wires pass.",a wheels-up landing due to an uncommanded gear retraction resulting from a short circuit of the landing gear electrical wiring.

The pilot prepared for his first flight in the airplane by making several taxi runs up and down the runway.  On take-off, the airplane became airborne half-way down the 2,700 foot long turf runway, but would not accelerate.  The pilot did not look at the airspeed indicator when the airplane rotated off the runway.  However, once airborne he reported that the airspeed indicator read about 60 knots, and that the manufacturer's recommended speed on climb-out was 75 knots.  The pilot felt that he would not clear the 60 foot trees located off the end of the runway, and elected to abort the take-off.  A videotape of the accident revealed that on take-off, when the airplane became airborne it flew just above the runway surface.  It then bounced once on the main wheels, pitched up and began to climb. The airplane obtained a height of about 10-15 feet above the ground before it descended and landed off to the right side of the runway.  Once on the ground, the airplane maneuvered back onto the runway.  However, the airplane again went off the right side of the runway into an area of high grass, collided with a tree stump and nosed over.

The student pilot was flying his own float-equipped airplane, as a flight of two airplanes, on a cross-country instructional flight.  The second airplane in the flight, equipped with wheels, was operated by the student's flight instructor.  During the flight, the weather conditions deteriorated to include light rain, gusty winds, and turbulence.  The flight instructor decided to land on a gravel airstrip adjacent to a small lake because he smelled a gasoline odor in his airplane.  The student pilot began a landing approach to the lake, but his first approach resulted in a go-around.  On the second landing approach, the student pilot said he bounced the landing on the water,and the airplane settled onto the lake, but a wind gust lifted the airplane off the water. He said he then forced the airplane onto the water, but while doing so, he took his eyes off the shore of the lake.  When the airplane finally settled onto the water, he noticed the airplane was close to the shore.  He shut the engine off, but the airplane hit the beach, and came to rest in an area of muskeg, about 40 feet from the shoreline.  The front float attach points were broken during the collision with the shore, and the airplane fuselage pivoted downward. The airplane received damage to the floats, engine cowling and propeller, the fuselage and wings.

After touchdown he observed a deer standing slightly right of the runway centerline and  chose not to attempt a go-around maneuver on the unidirectional runway because of the upsloping runway condition and tall trees at the north end.  The pilot believed that the deer was too close to allow the aircraft to stop in time and thus maneuvered to the left side of the runway trying to avoid a collision. He applied full brakes and during the landing roll, the aircraft departed the left side of the runway encountering an embankment and ground looping to a stop.  The pilot reported that the runway width was 50 feet with an approximate 25 feet of  additional surface outboard of each side of the runway.",The pilot's failure to maintain adequate directional control.

I step taxied to the southwest corner of the lake accelerating to the east and departed to the north to maximize the length of my takeoff run.  This time I lifted off cleanly with good airspeed.  Initially I climbed well, but after a bit my climb rate slowed.  At a point several hundred yards from shore I realized I may not clear the trees.  I did not feel I had enough room to safely turn the aircraft back, so I elected to maintain my direction and increase my angle of attack little by little to try to clear the trees and keep the aircraft flying.  I cleared the first row of trees, but dragged my left float through a tree top at which point the aircraft stalled falling off to the left, striking a tree with my left float.

The helicopter was in cruise flight when the pilot heard a ""bang,"" and lost tailrotor authority.  The pilot maneuvered for landing, and then reduced airspeed in anticipation of landing.  The helicopter began to rotate.  About 30 to 50 feet agl, the pilot pulled collective to cushion the landing.  The helicopter impacted the ground and rolled onto its side.  The helicopter received an annual inspection 11 months and 23.3 flight hours prior to the accident.  During the annual inspection, the mechanic documented that airworthiness directive (AD) 76-18-01 had been complied with.  Examination of the left aft cluster fitting revealed that the tailboom attaching point had separated severing the tailrotor drive shaft.  The fracture surfaces for the cluster fitting were relatively flat with smooth curving boundaries, ""features typical of fatigue.""  Most of the relatively rough area in the lower lug had curving arrest lines, ""features typical of low-cycle fatigue.""  AD 76-18-01 stated that within 50 flight hours of the effective date of the AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 50 hours of flight time, or until modifications are accomplished, the tailboom support strut aluminum end fittings were to be visually inspected for deformation or damage, and then checked for cracking using dye penetrant.  If cracking or damage was identified the effected structure would have had to been replaced.  The AD required the dye penetrant inspection be done in accordance with Service Information Notice N-82.3.  In addition, the Service Information Notice stated that a daily visual inspection was required, which the pilot stated he performed prior to the flight.","Failure of the left aft cluster fitting due to a fatigue crack.  Factors in the accident were the mechanic's failure to identify the crack at the last annual inspection, and the pilot's failure to identify the crack during the last daily inspection"

The pilot reported that  while enroute to the next field to be sprayed, at 500 feet, the engine lost power. After attempts to restore full power, the pilot selected a nearby field. During the autorotative touchdown,  the helicopter rolled over on the right side. During the engine examination, metal particles were recovered from the engine oil pump screen and the engine oil filter element. Further examination showed that # 1 cylinder connecting rod cap was wedged between the second crankshaft lobe and the engine case.  The examination of the helicopter also revealed that the landing skid and cross-tubs were fractured into several pieces. The fracture examination showed all fractures were in overload.  The engine had accumulated a total of 935.1 hours since the last major overhaul.",The pilot's improper use of flight controls during an autorotation that resulted inn the collapse of the skids and cross tube assembly. A factor was the loss of engine power due to the failure of # 1 connecting rod and the overload failure of the skids and cross tub assembly.

According to a witness, the airplane was observed making a steep turn to a right base.  During the turn, the airplane's tail abruptly went up, and the airplane entered a 2 1/2 spin to the right prior to impacting the ground.  There was no evidence of a pre-existing mechanical failure or malfunction.   According to the FAA publication Airplane Flying Handbook, section on accelerated stalls and cross control stalls, ...Stalls which result from abrupt maneuvers tend to be more rapid, or severe, than the unaccelerated stalls, and because they occur at higher-than-normal airspeeds, they may be unexpected by an inexperienced pilot. Failure to take immediate steps toward recovery when an accelerated stall occurs may result in a complete loss of flight control, notably, power-on spins... a cross control stall...is most apt to occur during a poorly planned and executed base-to-final approach turn...the airplane often stalls with little warning.  The nose may pitch down, the inside wing may suddenly drop and the airplane may continue to roll to an inverted position...It is imperative that this type of stall not occur during an actual approach to a landing since recovery may be impossible prior to ground contact due to the low altitude....""","The pilot's improper use of the flight controls while turning to base, which resulted in a stall/spin and subsequent impact with the ground."

The pilot had just completed a spraying pass, and was heading westbound about 100 feet and 60 mph, parallel to power lines and 15-20 feet above trees.  He suddenly felt something ""break"", and the helicopter started to yaw.  The pilot realized that the helicopter had experienced a tail rotor failure, but he didn't want to autorotate into trees.  He reduced the throttle slightly, maintained altitude, spun around two to three times, and cleared the trees.  He headed for a gravel area and rolled off the throttle, but couldn't stop the spin.  He attempted to cushion the landing, but the helicopter hit the ground hard.  On-scene examination revealed that the Thomas coupling disc assembly on the aft end of the aft short shaft was twisted and bent, and the tail rotor drive shaft just aft of the coupling was bent and separated, about mid-length.  A retaining bolt was missing from the Thomas coupling.  The missing bolt and washers were found in the helicopter's tailrotor drive shaft tunnel area, and appeared to be undamaged.  The self locking retaining nut for the bolt was not located.  Metallurgical review revealed that the Thomas coupling at the aft end of the aft short shaft was missing one of the bolt and nut sets that attached the coupling to the splined adapter at the forward end of the first segment of the tail rotor drive shaft.  The forward face of the flange adapter contained a series of rotational scoring and impact marks from contact with the bolt heads and discs.  The pattern of damage was consistent with the short shaft rotating around the bolt opposite from the missing bolt.  Additional examination of the Thomas coupling and associated components revealed that portions of the normal seating positions for the head of the missing bolt and the washer were relatively free of dirt and grease, and that the bore surface of the hole for the missing bolt in the flanged adapter at the forward end of the first segment contained thread imprint marks.","Under torque of a Thomas coupling self-locking nut for undetermined reasons, which resulted in the loss of the corresponding retaining bolt, and subsequent separation of tail rotor drive shaft segments.  A factor was the unsuitable terrain beneath the pilot when the loss of tail rotor occurred."

During the after-takeoff climb in high density altitude conditions, the aircraft encountered a dust devil/whirlwind that altered its attitude and heading. Although the pilot was able to recover from this upset, the aircraft was then headed for the knoll of a small hill. The pilot therefore raised the nose of the aircraft in an attempt to clear the knoll, but in doing so he allowed the airspeed to deteriorate, and the aircraft subsequently stall/mushed into the terrain.","The pilot's failure to maintain a speed above stall velocity (Vs) during the after-takeoff climb.

The airplane sustained substantial damage when it impacted a field and trees during a forced landing after a loss of engine power.  Witnesses reported the pilot departed on an unscheduled flight about 2115.  The airplane was observed flying at least one full stop landing before doing a low approach, and then departing the pattern.  A hand-held aviation Garmin GPS III was found in the ""ON"" position at the site of the accident.  The recorded track data indicated the airplane flew north and flew over or near five airports.  The track data indicated about 2 hours and 18 minutes elapsed during the portion of the flight recorded by the GPS.  A witness near the accident site reported, ""I observed what appeared to be an airplane flying in a north west direction at a low altitude.  It appeared as the airplane was losing altitude.  I lost sight of the airplane behind some trees at a distance.  At that time I did not hear engine noise from an airplane.  After several seconds passed I heard a loud crashing noise.""  Less than one gallon of fuel was found in the left and right fuel tanks. No fuel was found in the engine fuel lines, fuel pump, or carburetor bowl.  The inspection of the airplane revealed no preexisting anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.  Emergency responders reported that a 750 ml bottle of vodka was found in the cockpit with about 1/4 of it gone.  The toxicology report indicated that pilot's ethanol blood level was almost 5 times the legal limit for presumed intoxication in most states.",The fuel exhaustion due to the pilot's alcohol impaired decision making.

The airplane sustained substantial damage during a hard landing.  The pilot was uninjured during the solo instructional flight.  The student pilot stated, ""As the plane touched down on runway it seemed to land on main wheels but harder that normal and bounced upward at this time[.]  I added a little throttle to level plane back for proper landing and then pulled throttle back to idle as plane had smoothed out to flair however the plane touched the runway even a little harder than first bounced and I felt the plane was not safe to land at this time and did another go around.  I did not feel or see the prop or tail of plane touch runway surface[.]  As I did the proper procedure for go around the plane seemed to fly proper.  I then was instructed to use runway 08 for landing because of other traffic on route to 08 on final.  I followed this plane in after it had cleared the runway and landed the plane with more of a normal landing.  At this time a instructor greeted me upon securing the plane and damage was noted with prop being bent on both ends.""

The Cessna 310 ran off the end of a taxiway and collided with a berm during takeoff.  The pilot attempted to depart on a taxiway heading 210 degrees.  He stated that the left engine sputtered at some point during the takeoff roll.  An inspector from the Las Vegas Flight Standards District Office traveled to the accident site to run the engines.  According to the inspector, the left engine ran smoothly, throughout it's power range, with no anomalies noted.  The right engine started quickly, but upon reaching 1,000 rpm, the engine began to shake.  It was determined that the crankshaft had been bent slightly and it was not safe to run the engine again.  According to the Airport Facility Directory (AFD), the airport has only one runway oriented to 320 degrees and 140 degrees, respectively.  There is a 1- to 3-foot-high berm on both sides of the runway, running the full length of the runway which is 6,200 feet.  There are no other runways listed for the airport.  The AFD also warned of damage to aircraft on the taxiway due to debris.  All of the taxiway and runway surfaces at the airport are dirt.  The surface on which the pilot began his takeoff roll is bounded with blue taxiway markers and was estimated to be 2,100 feet from the point the takeoff began to the berm on the runway.  According to Cessna, a new Cessna 310 under similar conditions and loading, taking off on a level, dry hard surface runway, would require 1,738 feet to become airborne, and 2,061 feet to clear a 50-foot obstacle.  The accident airplane was built in 1964 and no allowances were made for the dirt surface on which the takeoff was attempted.",The pilot's attempt to depart on a taxiway unsuitable for takeoff under existing conditions.

The McDonnell Douglas MD-83, operated as a scheduled passenger flight, experienced a catastrophic failure of the left engine while flying at 31,000 feet.  The flightcrew heard a thud and noticed that the left engine was surging.  White smoke filled the cabin and cockpit.  The flightcrew donned their oxygen masks, declared an emergency and initiated an emergency descent to Kansas City International Airport (MCI), Kansas City, Missouri.  While descending towards MCI, the flight crew changed their emergency landing destination to Whiteman Air Force Base (SZL), Knob Noster, Missouri, when they were approximately 18 miles north of SZL.  Flight crews are not issued approach charts for SZL by their operator.  The flight crew requested the runway 19 instrument landing system (ILS) frequency from air traffic control (ATC) and were issued the incorrect frequency.  The flight crew also requested and was given the inbound course for ILS 19.  The flight crew never obtained the correct ILS frequency for the remainder of the flight and relied upon a radar approach to SZL.  During the approach, ATC instructed the flight crew to maintain the a minimum vectoring altitude of 2,500 feet mean sea level. The flight crew descended below minimum vectoring altitudes of 2,500 feet mean sea level to 1,800 feet msl in order to descend below a cloud layer which was 1,400 feet above ground level during the radar approach to SZL.   A metallurgical examination revealed a fatigue fracture of one fan blade. Examination of the left engine revealed that the fan exit case exhibited a 360 degree fan exit case fracture.  Several service bulletins (SBs) applicable to the fan exit case introduce a newer engine case made of steel to replace the older aluminum case and to install stops to restrict the axial separation of the case in the event of case fracturing.  The SBs state that there have been 5 instances of full 360 degree fan exit case fracture, all due to fan blade fracture.  They further state that when the case fractures, the front of the engine with the cowl shifts forward.  The incident engine had an aluminum fan exit case and did not have stops installed.",The separation of a fan blade due to fatigue failure which led to case separation and loss of engine power in the left engine.

This was the first flight of the homebuilt airplane following its certification on the day prior to the accident.  While returning from the airplane's maiden flight,  about 10 nautical miles from the airport, approximately 1,200 feet msl, the pilot turned the electric fuel pump on for landing, and the engine began to run ""rough.""  He turned the fuel pump off and the engine ""smoothed out.""  With the fuel pump on, the pilot could lean the mixture and get the engine to ""smooth out.""  After trying several combinations of fuel pump and mixture settings, the pilot thought the engine was running smooth and planned for a tight pattern, high speed approach, with the mixture full rich and the fuel pump off.   While on base leg, at approximately 600 feet agl, the aircraft appeared to be settling faster than anticipated.  The pilot attempted to add power, but the engine was ""dead and just wind milling.""   He went through a ""quick restart"" and at approximately 400 feet, initiated a forced landing to a nearby trailer park and declared an emergency.  The airplane touched down between two rows of trailers, and during the landing roll the right wing impacted a tree.  The airplane came to rest upright with the left wing against a house trailer.  The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined.",the loss of engine power for undetermined reasons during the landing approach.

The helicopter made a hard landing and severed the tail boom after an in-flight engine failure and autorotation.  The pilot reported seeing an engine chip light and hearing a whining sound in the engine about 700 feet agl.  An engine out light followed by a complete engine failure occurred about 1 minute later.  The pilot had been descending to land in an open field by that time.  The collective was lowered to enter an autorotation and aft cyclic applied to slow the forward airspeed.  As he neared the bottom of the maneuver, he pulled collective pitch to cushion the landing; however, the helicopter abruptly spun 90 degrees to the left.  The main rotor blades struck the tail boom and the ground.  The tail boom was separated from the helicopter.  After an inspection and teardown of the engine, the 2 1/2 bearing was found to have failed in fatigue.  Records revealed that a chip light had been reported in the same helicopter on a flight (4) days prior.  Before being returned to service, a magnetic plug inspection/cleaning and an engine ground test run were performed.  According to the Allision 250 Series Operation and Maintenance Manual, when either a chip light is encountered after a gearbox flush and a second ground test run has been performed or when a total of (4) chip lights have been encountered within 50 hours of engine operation, the engine must be removed from service and sent to the manufacturer's authorized maintenance center.",The failure of the accessory gearbox 2 1/2 bearing in fatigue resulting in the complete loss of engine power and a subsequent forced landing.  The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the autorotational flare maneuver is also causal.

The fixed based operator (FBO) stated that the aircraft was behind the ""follow me"" golf cart and passed through an opening between a parked aircraft and a metal pole.  The total distance betwen the parked aircraft and the pole was measured at 78 feet, and the wing span on the accident aircraft was measured at 35 feet.  The pilot stated while taxiing behind the ""follow me"" golf cart he was distracted by ground control who was trying to provide him with a telephone number to contact tower after securing his aircraft.",The pilot's inadaquate visual lookout and failure to maintain proper clearance from an object.  A factor was the pilot's distraction by a conversation with ground control.

Just after takeoff the pilot reported that the left engine lost power.  He checked that the mixture, propellers, and throttles were all full forward, and that the fuel selector was ""on.""  He said, ""...I checked the fuel selectors by feel only.""  He recycled the left engine feather control and made the decision to land gear up.  He retracted the landing gear, and attempted to feather the left engine again without success.  At this point he could not maintain altitude or airspeed, estimated that his altitude was ""between 150-200 feet,"" and the airspeed had decayed to 78 knots (83 was Vmc).  He elected to land on an interstate highway, before the airplane started a Vmc roll.  He landed in a southerly direction on the northbound lanes of the highway, first striking a light pole with the left wing, and then seven vehicles.  After coming to a stop, the two occupants evacuated the airplane after the passenger said he was ""in a puddle of fuel.""  The pilot stated that he ""..…reached down and moved the fuel selectors back.  They were full forward in the 'on' position.  I missed the 'off ' and mistakenly moved them to crossfeed as I exited the airplane.""  Examination of the fuel selectors at the crash site revealed that both engine fuel selectors were in the ""crossfeed"" position.  The left engine was test run, and no discrepancies were found.  Fuel was found in the left engine.  The fuel was visually examined for contamination and water, none was observed.  Examination of the right engine revealed, no discrepancies.","A loss of engine power, and the pilot unable to feather the propeller for undetermined reasons, which resulted in a forced landing on a highway, subsequent impact with a pole and vehicles."

According to the CFI, the private pilot was executing touch and go's on runway 03.  During the third landing, after touchdown, the airplane's tailwheel began to ""chatter.""  The airplane started to veer to the right and did not respond to left rudder or brake inputs by the CFI, who had taken over the controls.  The airplane then departed the right side of the runway and nosed over.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the high and low frequency anti-shimmy compression springs on the tailwheel assembly ""had slack.""  The ""slack"" allowed for about 2 inches of rudder movement before the compression springs became effective.  Review of the airplane's maintenance records revealed that it had seven annual inspections performed after the installation of the tailwheel assembly.  The most recent annual inspection was conducted about four months prior to the accident, and the airplane had accumulated about 15 hours of operation since.  According to FAA regulations, Appendix D of Part 43, Scope And Detail Of Items To Be Included In Annual And 100-Hour Inspections, each person performing an annual or 100-hour inspection shall inspect all units of the landing gear group for poor condition and insecurity of attachment.  The winds reported at a nearby airport, about the time of the accident, were from 320 degrees at 10 knots.","The second pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing.  Factors related to the accident were the crosswind conditions, the loose tailwheel assembly, the CFI's delayed remedial action, and the inadequate annual inspection procedures by maintenance personnel."

After takeoff using standard power at 100 feet above ground level (AGL) the #3 engine fire warning light with normal engine indications illuminated. While the captain and second officer accomplished the engine fire/severe damage checklist  the #3 oil low pressure light came on and the #3 generator tripped off. The fire warning light did not go out until the second fire bottle was used. They declared an emergency with the tower, and made a normal landing and taxied clear of the runway. Emergency crews inspected the airplane and observed no indication of fire. They subsequently did a normal taxi back to the gate and there was a normal shutdown. Examination of the engine found the starter turbine was missing from the starter assembly, however, the turbine was recovered from the engine cowling.  All of the tips on the full length airfoils had rub marks with material displaced away from the direction of rotation. The starter shaft was separated 2 1/4-inchs from the impeller. The bearing was broken and rubbed flush to the shaft. The ignition exciter box brackets were burned and the box was hanging by the cable. The ignition exciter box was burned open.",The failure of the #3 engine starter turbine.

The airplane arrived in the vicinity of Joplin, Missouri, just after midnight.  At 0011:38, Kansas City ARTCC (ZKC) informed the pilot that the weather at the Joplin Regional Airport (JLN) was 800 broken, 5,000 overcast and 10 miles visibility.  The pilot, operating under visual flight rules, told ZKC that they would need an instrument approach into JLN.  ZKC cleared the pilot to JLN and gave the pilot radar vectors to the ILS to runway 13.  At 0031:35, the pilot told ZKC that he was getting warning flags for the localizer and glide slope.  The pilot elected to transition to the ILS for runway 18.  ZKC gave him vectors for the approach.  At 0033:46, ZKC asked the pilot if he still had plenty of fuel?  The pilot confirmed he had 2 hours of fuel on board.  At 0042:30, ZKC cleared the pilot for the ILS approach.  At 0046:36, ZKC lost radar contact with the airplane.  The pilot told ZKC they were at 2,700 feet, descending.  At 0048:40, ZKC transmitted to the pilot that his airplane was just about over JLN at 2,400 feet.  The pilot told ZKC they were going missed approach and requested another approach to runway 18.  At 0055:16, the pilot transmitted, ""... we're having a little problem here I think we've lost an engine I'm trying to get leveled off here and get back to 4,000 feet.""  ZKC told the pilot, ""... keep me advised.""  At 0056:06, ZKC transmitted that he showed the airplane descending below 2,300 feet.  There was no response from the airplane.  The last positions recorded by ZKC radar showed the airplane 3 miles east of JLN in a rapid descent.  Witnesses on the ground heard an airplane make several passes over Carterville, Missouri.  One witness said that on the airplane's third pass, it sounded like a single engine airplane.  Another witness said she saw the lights on the airplane.  The witness described the airplane pitch up into a 30-degree nose high climb, roll counterclockwise, and then enter a 45-degree dive toward the ground.  The airplane continued its counterclockwise roll until she lost sight of it behind some trees.  A witness residing in the house across the street from the house the airplane struck, said when he heard the airplane, it sounded like it was in a nosedive barrel roll.  The witness said it was loud and fast.  It sounded like a loud engine running and it sounded like one engine, not two.  An examination of the airplane revealed no pre-impact anomalies.  The published decision height for the ILS/DME runway 18 approach at JLN is 1,165 feet.  The pilot had 6,823.8 total flying hours.  Approximately 1,440 hours were in multi-engine airplanes.  The pilot's last recorded flight in a multi-engine airplane was in a Cessna 337 on October 26, 2000.  According to the previous owner of the airplane, the pilot got checked out in the airplane 6 days before the accident.","The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control and the pilot's improper in-flight planning and decisions.  Factors relating to the accident were the pilot's lack of experience in the airplane, the inadvertent spiral, and the residence."

The airplane collided with the terrain following a loss of control while landing on on the grass airstrip.  The pilot reported that he departed the airport and made a left hand traffic pattern to land on runway 08.  He reported he was going to make a full stop landing using rudder control on the grass runway.  He continued to report, ""Airplane started going to right.  Used small corrections left rudder.  Did not change made more corrections,  Airplane was leaving right side of runway.  The I believe I pushed on both rudders and brakes.  Airplane turned sharp right hand 90 [degree] turn.  Broke left, slammed left wing into ground.""  A witness to the accident reported, ""The plane touched down, bounced up a little and then touched down again and started veering to the right.  The right wheel broke off and the plane tipped over on the left wing.""  The student pilot reported a total of 52 hours of flight time, 14 of which were in the accident make and model of airplane.",The pilot failed to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing.  Factors associated with the accident were the pilot's  inadequate recovery from a bounced landing and his lack of experience in the make and model of the accident airplane.

The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing when it hit a powerline during aerial application.  The pilot reported the weather was hot and humid and clouds were starting to build into thunderheads.  He reported, ""The air had moderate turbulence along the ground and visibility was good.""  He had been flying a racetrack pattern during the aerial application flight, passing under a set of powerlines many times.  He reported, ""As I approached the line, the top wing blocked out the line as I approached.  I used the base of the tower as a reference point.  The end of the field was about 400 feet to the front of the airplane.  As I passed I felt the sensation of a rapid rise.  I pushed the stick forward[.] There was no change.  I pushed the stick hard to the stop I was still going up.  Then I hit, I stood hard left rudder and still had the stick forward.  After bouncing around the plane was nose down.  I straightened out to level flight and flew a straight line to look at the structure of the plane.  There was no vibration and nothing was missing.""  The pilot reported the landing was uneventful.  The pilot reported the airplane did not have a mechanical malfunction prior to the impact with the powerline.",the pilot failed to maintain clearance from the powerline.  Additional factors were the thermal lift and the powerline.

The non-current pilot, who was undergoing a 14 CFR 61.56 flight review with a flight instructor, was practicing a short field landing.  According to airport data at the Internet site www.airnav.com, a 4-foot terrain rise is located 80 feet from the end of the runway.  The pilots stated that this rise had a heavy growth of wheat about 3 to 4 feet tall at the time.  The trainee pilot stated that the wheat at that time ""was a solid dark green which gave no depth perception"", which he stated ""in essence created an invisible...wall"" on short final.  While on short final, the aircraft contacted the wheat, causing a rapid deceleration and loss of altitude (the flight instructor stated that once he noticed the terrain rise, he was unable to get on the controls before the aircraft contacted the wheat.)  The airplane subsequently struck an approximately 2-foot-high bank along a dirt road approximately 40 feet from the end of the runway.  As the aircraft crossed over this bank, all three wheels caught on the bank and sheared off.  The aircraft then came down on the runway and slid down the runway for about 250 to 300 feet.  According to the U.S. Government Airport/Facility Directory, the runway has a yellow centerline marking only, and the markings are very faded.  The runway does not have a displaced threshold or visual approach slope indicator (VASI), and the U.S. Government Airport/Facility Directory lists obstructions for the runway as a powerline.","The non-current pilot's failure to maintain sufficient altitude or clearance with wheat crops on short final, and the flight instructor's inadequate remedial action.  Factors included wheat crops and a dirt bank on short final, the runway's lack of a visual approach slope indicator installation, and a visual illusion (wheat crop matched background color) that impaired both pilots' ability to visually detect the wheat crops."

When the aircraft did not return from an aerial application flight, a search of the area began.  The aircraft was located in an open flat to rolling wheat field about two miles from the airport.  Impact signatures indicate that the aircraft collided with the terrain in a nose low attitude.   A local resident who knew the pilot and aircraft reported that she observed the aircraft headed to the southwest and that ""he (the pilot) wasn't flying right..."" and that ""...he was slowly descending and his right wing would dip down then up then down then up.  His plane was never flying steady like normal.""  No evidence of a mechanical failure or malfunction was found.  No evidence of pilot incapacitation was found.",The pilot's failure to maintain terrain clearance for undetermined reasons.

The student pilot was departing from a 3,700 feet long, paved runway.  During the takeoff roll, about midway down the runway, she felt that the airplane was not going to fly as the airspeed exceeded 70 knots, so she closed the throttle, and applied heavy braking.  The airplane veered slightly to the right, continued off the end of the runway, and nosed over.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and engine firewall.  An FAA airworthiness inspector traveled to the accident airport and examined the airplane.  He reported that he was unable to detect any preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane.",The pilot's delay in aborting the takeoff roll.

The experimental amateur built airplane was destroyed by impact with a transmission wire, with terrain, and by fire following an in-flight loss of control during climbout.  An interview with a witness who had test flown the accident aircraft that morning, noted that, ""On the final flight [the witness] found it controllable, but very sensitive to elevator inputs and almost unresponsive to rudder input during flight.  [The witness] said he only flew it around the traffic pattern once that morning.  ... [The witness] told [the owner] it was OK for taxi, but not safe to fly, and [the owner] departed to taxi it up and down the runway.  After some taxiing on the runway, [the witness] observed the aircraft lift-off  from runway 15, yaw noticeably to the left, recover and continue climbing out.  About 1/2 mile away, he observed it begin a turn to the left, pitch up, stall, and begin a spin to the right.  He said it did about 3/4 of a full right spin, disappeared behind trees off the end of the runway and exploded, apparently on impact with the ground.""  The wind was 140 degrees at 3 knots.  The Sheriff's stated, ""The craft was located in a field South of [road] 5-120 near Show Me Electrics power lines.  ... It appears that the craft struck the ground finally resting on it's top.  ... That prior to the craft making contact with the ground it appears that the leading edge of the left wing struck the 'Center Phase' power line approx nine feet from the wing tip.""","The pilot not performing an aborted takeoff and the inadvertent stall he encountered on his inadvertent initial climb.  Factors were his inadvertent lift-off, the reported inadequate rudder control, his inadvertent flight with known deficiencies, and the transmission wire."

The airplane experienced a hard landing following a loss of engine power while manuevering.  The pilot was throwing candy out of the aircraft to a group of children on the ground who were attending a fly-in.  The pilot reported the ""pusher propeller sustained serious damage due to ingested candy.  Severe vibration caused by shattered propeller instantly caused separation of rear carb causing air filter to further damage propeller and killing engine due to loss of fuel.""  The pilot reported the only open area for a forced landing was almost directly below the aircraft and ahead of it.  The pilot reported, ""From approximately 50 feet altitude and 38 mph indicated airspeed nosed plane straight down into only possible open area avoiding all spectators.""  The airplane impacted the terrain approximately 100 feet off the end of the runway.","The pilot's poor planning which resulted in foreign object damage to the propeller, and the low altitude at which the loss of power occurred which resulted in the pilot not being able to properly flare the airplane.

The helicopter sustained substantial damage on impact with vehicles and terrain on takeoff following a reported in-flight loss of engine power.  The pilot and two passengers sustained minor injuries.  The pilot stated, ""The fact that all was indicating normal, I re-confirmed power settings and we departed via a normal rate of climb takeoff.  ...  It was quite obvious very quickly the aircraft had momentarily suffered a partial power loss.  I was not at sufficient altitude to reduce collective to minimize power applications and as such upon realizing despite instrument indications as stated the a/c was descending rapidly and would impact into a parking lot of vehicles below me."" The pilot stated that there was no other suitable terrain to land on.   A witness stated, ""The pilot then nosed the helicopter over and started moving forward and gaining altitude.  At that point I started to turn to the person next to me to say something but my attention was immediately drawn back to the departing helicopter because of a change in the sound from the helicopter.""

The motorglider was destroyed by fire after an emergency landing.  After takeoff, the aircraft was passing through 1,000 feet agl, when the pilot heard a ""loud pop"" and smoke started coming into the cockpit.  The engine started running rough and the pilot shut down the engine and executed an emergency landing.  The fire consumed the wing attachment area and the cockpit forward of the engine compartment within five minutes of the initial engine failure.  The examination of the wreckage revealed the cockpit, engine compartment, and inner wing were destroyed by fire.  Only the tail section and about 10 feet of each outer wing panel remained intact.  The fire in the engine containment area destroyed all non-metallic components.  The left side of the engine sustained extensive heat damage resulting in the melting of the left carburetor, the left intake manifold, the left carburetor tray, and the engine alternator.  The stainless steel firewall shroud in front, aft, and on top of the engine was found in place.  The side cowlings that cover the engine compartment are made of composite materials and coated with fire retardant-not fire proof-paint.  The side cowlings were consumed by fire.  The inspection of the aircraft did not reveal what initiated the loss of engine power and subsequent in-flight fire. The total airframe time was 50 total hours and the engine time was 27 hours.  An examination of a new production Stemme S10-VT motorglider revealed the following: 1) The forward and aft firewalls contained openings which did not incorporate fireproof grommets, bushings, or firewall fittings.  2) Rubber fuel lines and fittings within the engine compartment were not sealed or clamped to prevent exposure to engine fires.  Rubber fuel lines and plastic fuel filters were mounted against the forward side of the engine firewall. 3) The carburetors and other associated fuel system components were located directly over unprotected exhaust system components. 4) The forward, top, and aft sides of the Stemme S10-VT engine compartment are made of 0.040-inch-thick stainless steel sheet metal.  The sides and bottom of the engine compartment are made of composite material.  The Stemme S10-VT is manufactured in Germany and certified in accordance with the JAR-22, Joint Airworthiness Requirements for Sailplanes and Powered Sailplanes, effective through Change 4, including 22.375 of Amendment 22/90/1.

The pilot, who was seated in the right seat, reported they flew into the airport to attend a pancake breakfast.  He reported that after landing a flagman directed them to a parking spot where they came to a complete stop.  He reported that he knew they were going to need fuel prior to departing so he opened the door and exited the airplane onto the wing to look for a fuel truck.  The pilot reported the propeller was still turning when he exited the airplane.  He reported, ""While standing on the wing of the parked aircraft, I slipped and went forward and threw up my left arm to protect instinctively myself and the result is that I ended up on the ground with a broken left arm and a cut on my left arm.""  The pilot rated passenger in the left seat reported, ""[The pilot] wanted to get fuel.  I suggested we shut the engine down and get fuel after breakfast.

During a low altitude erratic flight, the airplane dropped rapidly until it hit the shoulder of a freeway and burst into flames.  The pilot had been flying the airplane for several months since he completed building it.  He had taken off and was several miles from his home airport.  Witnesses observed the airplane about 125 feet above ground level, and the whole airplane weaved up and down as well as left and right.  The engine was loud and high-pitched, but the witnesses didn't think that the airplane was going very fast.  They did not observe any smoke, flames, or pieces falling from the airplane.  As the airplane flew over a highway, it banked hard to the right and lost altitude.  The airplane turned parallel to the freeway, and the erratic movement increased.  The terrain sloped down at this point, and the airplane continued downhill parallel to the slope.  The airplane cleared power lines, but then dropped rapidly until it hit the shoulder of the freeway.  The engine sounded like it was running until the airplane cleared the power lines, and then the engine sound died.  The kit manufacturer reported that the pilot had been in contact with them while he constructed the airplane.  He told them that his initial flights occurred in early May 2001.  The flights went well, and he was happy with the airplane's performance.  He did slow flight and landings on the first 2-hour flight.  He moved the airplane to Cameron Park, but damaged the tailskid, landing gear, and prop when the control stick grip came off during the landing flare.  The pilot repaired the airplane, and the manufacturer disassembled and inspected the propeller hub.  The manufacturer replaced the actuating cam guide pins as a precaution.  Investigators were unable to detect any anomalies during examination of the wreckage that could account for the accident.",an in-flight collision with terrain for undetermined reasons.

The airplane was on approach to runway 10, an asphalt runway, that was about 2,400 feet long, and 30 feet wide.  The pilot reported he experienced a ""wind gust"" while on final approach, which pushed the airplane to the left.  The pilot maneuvered the airplane back toward the runway, and then attempted a go-around.  A witness stated the airplane was approximately one-third of the way down the runway, when it was pushed ""over the grass area.""  After the pilot maneuvered the airplane back over the runway, he heard the engine power increase and observed the airplane bank to the right.  During the go-around, the airplane impacted trees that were located about 300 feet beyond the departure end of the runway.  Examination of the airplane did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions.  It was noted that the terrain sloped upward toward the trees located at the end of the runway.  The pilot reported he was unfamiliar with the airport, and did not realized the ground sloped upward until he was closer to the trees.  Winds reported at an airport about 16 miles west of the accident site were from 290 degrees at 10 knots.","The pilot's delayed go-around, which resulted in an in-flight collision with trees.

The certificated commercial pilot, with three passengers aboard, departed on a cross-country personal flight through mountainous terrain, in a float-equipped airplane. The purpose of the flight was to show the three passengers some Alaskan scenery.  The route of flight included a stop at a remote lake, frequently visited by the pilot.  About 6 hours after departure, an ELT signal was received, and an aerial search was initiated.  The wreckage was located in an area of mountainous terrain, and along the airplane's anticipated return flight route, between the remote lake and the airplane's home base airport.  A State of Alaska, Fish and Wildlife Protection Officer involved in the search, reported that after locating the wreckage, he landed his wheel-equipped airplane along a ridgeline, located about 1,000 feet above the wreckage site.  During the approach for landing, he encountered winds out of the southeast, estimated to be 17 to 20 knots.  He added that the location of the accident airplane's wreckage was situated on the downwind side of the mountainous terrain.  Postaccident investigation revealed that the nose of the airplane impacted in a near vertical attitude, on the soft, tundra-covered terrain.

During the takeoff roll, the tailwheel lifted and the airplane continued to rotate forward in the pitch axis.  The airplane nosed over, struck the propeller, and continued through a nose-over, ground-loop maneuver until it came to rest.  The pilot reported that during the takeoff roll, he felt the brake grab on the right side, and the airplane swerved to the right prior to the nose-over.  Two Federal Aviation Administration inspectors examined the airplane and reported that the right brake was binding while the left brake was free.  The right wheel hub was warped on the inside, and the brake shoes were worn unevenly.  The right side also had grease on the brake shoes.  Their examination of the maintenance logs revealed that the owner of the airplane had performed an annual inspection on the airplane 13 hours prior to the accident.","The inadequate maintenance inspection of the airplane by its owner, which resulted in a locked brake and a nose-over during the takeoff roll."

The pilot checked the weather at 1400 and 1700, and determined that there was no significant weather forecasted along the intended route of flight.  He and his passengers departed around 1900 along with several other balloons for the sightseeing flight.  The pilot said that clouds began to gather to the northwest during the flight, and ""the cell became more ominous"" and ""apparent that it would overtake us.""  The pilot said that the wind shifted and increased in speed, and each attempt to land was aborted due to the high vertical wind shear. On the last attempt to land, the pilot said that ""violent down drafts"" were experienced and he was unable to abort the landing.  The balloon made contact with a tree, and was momentarily tangled.  Once free, the pilot observed power lines and a cell phone tower, and elected to ""pull the top"" about 30-feet above the ground.  The balloon contacted the ground at a high rate of descent and forward airspeed, which resulted in the balloon being dragged about 70 feet.  The pilot reported that the weather was overcast with light rain, and the winds were from the northwest at a speed greater than 10 knots.  Examination of a radar summary chart revealed that the primary radar site for New Jersey was not available.  However, the surrounding radar sites did deflect echoes in the northern New Jersey area, but only reported level 1 and 2 activity.","pilot's continued flight into known adverse weather conditions, which resulted in a hard landing.  A factor was the downdrafts."

The airplane lifted off in ground effect, veered to the left, and the airplane touched down off the runway in soft dirt and overturned.  The pilot landed at Cliff Dwellers Lodge in anticipation of launching on a rafting trip.  Lodge personnel informed him that his party would be leaving from nearby Marble Canyon.  He did not shut the airplane down and taxied back for takeoff on runway 22, which was a 40-foot-wide dirt runway, 3,820 feet long, at an elevation of 4,217 feet.  He used 20 degrees of flaps and the wind was calm.  The runway was rough and jostled the airplane more than the pilot was used to.  The pilot departed from midfield and the runway sloped uphill in the direction of departure.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) states that a minimum ground run takeoff can be accomplished using 20 degrees of flaps and leaving the ground in a slightly tail-low attitude.  However, it directs the pilot to immediately level off and accelerate to a safe climb speed.","The pilot's failure to use all the available runway and his failure to follow the prescribed short field takeoff procedure resulting in a loss of control during the takeoff roll.  Factors were the short, rough, and rising runway, and the soft dirt surrounding the runway."

According to the pilot the engine was surging as the airplane started its takeoff roll.  When the airplane became airborne the pilot reported he could not maintain altitude and elected to make a forced landing, coming to rest upside down in a tree about 40 feet above the ground.    The pilot stated he was flying solo, landed at an airport, and on takeoff ""...the engine didn't feel right on full throttle.""  He and a co-owner of the airplane tried to find the problem, but they could not.  They then decided to fly to the airport where the accident eventually took place.   They landed twice, and on the second takeoff the pilot stated ""...the problem showed up, landing us in the trees.""  The fuel burn for this airplane was 10 to 10.5 gallons per hour in level flight.  Each fuel tank held 26 gallons, for a total of 52 gallons, of which 9 gallons of fuel was unusable, or 43 gallon of usable fuel.  The fuel tanks were topped off on June 28, 2001.  The owner/student pilot did not log all the time since last refueling the airplane, but 3.98 hours were logged.  At 10.5 gallon per hour, 41.79 gallons of fuel would have been used in 3.98 hours.  Examination of the fuel system after the accident revealed that about 2 gallons of fuel was drained from the left tank, and no fuel was found in the right tank.  The fuel that was drained was clean with no evidence of sediment or water.  In addition, there was no evidence of fuel leaks found at the accident site, and no fuel odor was noted at the accident site.  Examination of the propeller and engine revealed no discrepancies.","the pilot's improper fuel consumption calculations, inadequate preflight planning, and failure to refuel the airplane before takeoff, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion, and a forced landing in trees."

The pilot, an orthopedic surgeon, departed his home airport and flew over the local area for about 1 hour.  The airplane was observed circling over a cornfield, and initially climbed, but then descended rapidly into the terrain.  Witnesses stated that the engine noise could be heard, and was consistent throughout the accident.  Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  Review of the pilot's medical and pharmacy records revealed a history of Hodgkin's disease, substantial damage to his gastrointestinal tract, hypothyroidism, gall bladder disease, and coronary artery bypass surgery.  In addition, the pilot required most of his calories to be delivered intravenously through a surgically placed port in his chest.  Within 1 year prior to the accident, the pilot had filled prescriptions for Synthroid, Zoloft, Deseryl, Prozac, Imodium, and Lasix.  The pilot wrote all of his most recent prescriptions.  However, on his most recent application for an FAA third class medical certificate, the pilot listed only Synthroid as a currently used medication.  An aviation medical examiner noted the pilot's weight at 152 pounds, and his height at 71 inches.  The examiner did not issue a medical certificate, and deferred it to the FAA Aeromedical Certification Division, citing the Hodgkin's disease, coronary artery disease, bowel adhesions, and ""a central line which he still uses for occasional enteral feeding.""  The Manager of the FAA Aeromedical Certification Division authorized a special issuance of a third class medical certificate, but did not mention the abdominal problems, the presence of a central line, or the need for parenteral feeding.  The Manager did note a history of coronary artery disease.  Toxicological testing performed on the pilot revealed sertraline and tramadol present in the blood.  The level of sertraline present in the blood was more than five times higher than would be expected from maximum recommended dosage.  The level of tramadol in the blood was almost twenty times the maximum level expected from a typical single dose of the drug.  Sertraline (Zoloft) is a prescription antidepressant, and tramadol is a prescription narcotic-like painkiller.","The pilot's incapacitation, which resulted in a loss of aircraft control while maneuvering.  A factor was the FAA Aeromedical Certification Division's inadequate certification/approval of the pilot's medical certificate.  Findings were the pilot's inappropriate use of medication, and depression."

Witnesses reported hearing an airplane engine at night, at high power for about 5 seconds followed by impact.  They went to the scene and found the airplane on the left side of the approach end of runway 03, on fire.  The pilot was removed and the fire was extinguished.  The airplane had struck a runway threshold light located about 25 feet to the left side of the runway, and slid about 100 feet into trees, angling away from the runway on a heading of 360 degrees.  The outboard 5 feet of the left wing was bent up about 20 degrees.  Ground scars were found corresponding to the positions of the left, right, and nose landing gears, all of which had collapsed.  The inboard section of the left wing  came to rest on the nose of the airplane.  The propeller blades were deformed with ""S"" bending and leading edge gouges.  Flight control continuity was verified to the rudder and elevator.  The aileron control cables had separated with puffed ends.  All separations occurred at other than attach points.

The airplane was refueled, and then departed on an aerial photography flight.  Within 10 minutes, the airplane had reached the target area.  The pilot slowed the airplane to 60 knots, and selected the carburetor heat to ""ON,"" but did not lean the mixture.  The pilot then spent about 5 hours maneuvering and taking photographs.  The pilot configured the airplane for ""normal"" cruise and proceeded towards his planned destination.  About 1 hour later and while operating approximately 1,000 feet agl, the pilot experienced a sudden loss of engine power.  While maneuvering for a field, the pilot moved the fuel selector from ""LEFT"" to ""BOTH"" to ""LEFT,"" and then back to ""BOTH,"" the engine did not regain power.  He did not select the right tank.  The airplane touched down, impacted some trees, and came to rest upright and level.  Examination of the left and right fuel tanks by an FAA inspector revealed that the left tank was intact and empty.  The right was also intact, and had approximately 1 inch of fuel in it.  The left fuel gauge indicated 1/16 of a tank, and the right indicated empty.","The pilot's failure to adequately manage the available fuel, which resulted in fuel starvation."

At about the same time the aircraft experienced a sudden loss of forward thrust, with the engine continuing to run.  I tried to maintain aircraft control to attempted to glide the aircraft back to the runway.  The aircraft struck the ground about 20-25 feet right of the runway, turning about 180 degrees counter-clockwise, after impact.""  The pilot reported that he believed the loss of forward thrust was due to the propeller pitch adjustment prior to the accident flight.   The propeller was inspected and was found at a minimum pitch setting of approximately 3 degrees.",The pilot not maintaining aircraft control while maneuvering during initial climb.  Factors to the accident were the improperly serviced propeller that resulted in a pitch setting that was insufficient for normal flight.

The instructor said that on their second circuit in the landing pattern, the student was flying the glider within acceptable limits.  He was controlling his airspeed and sink rate properly on long final.  The glider was approaching runway 30 when they noticed another glider that was much lower and needed priority for the runway.  The instructor directed the student to do a sidestep maneuver and land on runway 30 left, a parallel dirt runway.  The student began a left sideslip to line up on the parallel runway.  The instructor stated that he was controlling the slip properly, and was controlling his sink rate with small applications of the spoilers.  During the landing flare, the student applied full spoiler while still 1 to 1 1/2 feet in the air, at approximately 60 knots.  The instructor was unable to overcome the rapid nose down pitching moment and the subsequent increase in sink rate.  The left wing was slightly lower than the right due to the previous slip maneuver.  When the glider landed hard, the left wing made contact with the ground, resulting in a ground loop to the left.  The instructor believed that no damage had been done to the glider, but upon exiting the cockpit, he noticed that the tail boom had cracked just ahead of the empennage structure.  The instructor stated that in the future, he will place his hand just behind the spoiler control lever and restrict the aft movement to an acceptable position for the flight conditions.","The student pilot's early deployment of full spoilers, resulting in an excessive sink rate and subsequent hard landing.  A factor was the instructor's lack of time to take remedial action."

Prior to departing on the accident flight, the pilot fueled the airplane with fuel cans that he had in the garage; however, he could not recall how old the fuel was, or when the last fueling of the airplane took place.  The pilot estimated that the wing tanks were filled ""half way"" prior to the fueling.  After departure, while in cruise flight, the pilot turned the airplane, and the engine suddenly lost all power.  The pilot performed a forced landing to a construction site, and the airplane touched down hard, coming to rest upright.  The fuel tanks were not equipped with fuel sump drains, and the only means of assuring the fuel was absent of contamination, was a sump drain located on the manifold, which provided fuel to the engine.  According to a representative of the airplane kit manufacturer, the kit was produced with two flat fuel tanks, which included withdrawal points located on the front and back of the tanks.  Fuel lines from both wing tanks were then routed to a ""mixer block,"" which was located about 2 feet below the tanks.  A valve, located on the ""mixer block,"" enabled the pilot to drain fuel and check for contamination.  The representative added that it was at the discretion of the kit builder to install sump drains at the low point of the wing fuel tanks, and they did not provide any guidance on preflight procedures.",Fuel contamination.  A factor related to the accident was the builder’s decision to not install fuel tank drains.

The certificated airline transport pilot, with two passengers aboard, was conducting an aerial timber survey.  While in cruise flight about 1,000 feet above the ground, the engine began to backfire, run rough, and lose power.  The engine then quit, and the pilot selected a gravel bar along a glacial fed river as an emergency landing area.  During the emergency approach to landing, the airplane landed short of the intended landing site, touched down in about 3 feet of water, and nosed over.  After recovery, an FAA airworthiness inspector examined the airplane. The inspector reported that the number seven cylinder was cracked, the number nine cylinder had no compression, and that about one cup of clear water was found within the carburetor float bowl.  The inspector said that he was unable to determine if the cylinder damage, or the presence of water in the carburetor was a result of impact damage with the river water.

A fire erupted in the right engine nacelle during a maintenance check flight following replacement of the engine.  The pilot shutoff the engine and feathered the propeller; however, before he could complete the emergency checklist, black smoke began entering the cockpit via a fresh air vent in the leading edge of the wing near the nacelle.  The visibility in the cockpit dropped to about 1 foot and the pilot couldn't see outside, or the instrument panel, or any controls.  He declared an emergency and opened the pilot's window.  He instructed his passenger to crack open the main door; however, his passenger couldn't find the door handles in the dense smoke.  After a period of time he got the door cracked open and the smoke cleared.  At that point they were down to 300 or 400 feet agl, and he identified an open field in which an emergency landing was made.  Examination of the right-hand engine revealed it was mechanically intact; however, a hose-end ""B-nut"" at the inlet to the engine driven fuel pump exhibited an unusual number of exposed threads.  The B-nut was loose and required 1 1/8 turns to finger-tighten and 1 1/4  turns to snug tighten with a wrench.  When the B-nut was unscrewed from the fitting, the threads of the fitting and the B-nut itself did not exhibit any cracks or stripped threads.  No other mechanical anomalies were found.",The failure of maintenance personnel to properly tighten a fuel line fitting during an engine installation resulting in a fuel leak and fire during the maintenance checkflight.

Another pilot witnessed the aircraft takeoff.  His attention was drawn to the airplane as it flew past his position because it was ""hanging there,"" flying at a slow speed, and appeared to be trying to climb.  It was about 100 feet above the runway and he noticed that the wing flaps were full down.  As it traveled further it started to sink and then disappeared from his view behind hangars.  He didn't think the engine sounded as though it was operating at full power.  The density altitude was approximately 7,000 feet.  The aircraft struck electrical power transmission wires at the departure end of the runway and subsequently crashed 3 miles from the airport.  At the scene, the pilot identified himself to law enforcement personnel using the pilot certificate number of another pilot whose name was spelled similarly.  Federal Aviation Administration Airman Records database showed the pilot's private pilot certificate was in a revoked status.  NTSB form 6120.1/2, Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, was sent to the pilot's local address and was not returned.

The pilot had conducted two VOR approaches to the airport, each to a missed approach.  After the second missed approach, the controller queried the pilot if the missed approach was due to fog.  The pilot advised the controller that ""…there's pockets in and out but I can't get the runway in sight...""  The pilot then requested, and was cleared, for a third approach.  The controller requested the pilot to contact the advisory frequency at the airport, which the pilot complied.  No further radio transmissions were received from the airplane.  The airplane came to rest in a wooded area about 2 miles northwest of the airport, at an elevation of 1,679 feet msl.  The wreckage path was orientated on a 245-degree bearing.  The missed approach point for the VOR approach was located at the runway threshold.  The missed approach procedure required the pilot to initiate a climbing right turn to 3,400 feet, then proceed back to the northeast, to an intersection located about 5.2 miles northeast of the airport, and hold.  An FAA inspector flew the runway 25 VOR approach the day of the accident.  No abnormalities with the navigation or airport facilities were noted.  Review of the Airport Facility Directory revealed an airport remark for N23 that stated, ""Numerous hills surround arpt up to 800 ft above arpt elevation.""

The airplane was observed proceeding westbound from the airport at a low altitude.  A witness said, ""I watched and listened thinking he would soon apply power and climb.  The engine noise was smooth sounding but low.  The plane was not gaining altitude and slowly losing altitude.""  The witness said the airplane flew parallel to, and north of the road in front of her house.  ""As it crossed the point of my driveway, the plane banked slightly, hit the tree tops and crashed and exploded.""  Control tower communications revealed that shortly after being instructed to contact departure control, the pilot responded, ""two hotel whiskey - engine failure"".  An examination of airframe records showed that a new engine was installed at the annual inspection on February 5, 2001.  The airplane logged approximately 75.7 hours from the time of the annual inspection to the time of the accident.  An examination of the airplane's engine revealed that three teeth from the camshaft gear were fractured.  An additional eight teeth were crushed, in total rendering the camshaft unable to be driven.  A Materials Laboratory examination of the camshaft gear and fractured gear teeth showed two of the three teeth indicating signs of fatigue.  The third tooth showed evidence of overstress.  Rockwell hardness measurements made on the gear portion of the camshaft gear showed an average hardness of Rockwell 64HR30-N.  Specification drawings for the camshaft gear indicated that the gear teeth should be hardened by gas-nitride process to a hardness of Rockwell 69HR30-N, minimum.","The fractured camshaft gear and the pilot not maintaining aircraft control.

On short final to runway 19 right at McCarran, the engine lost power, resulting in a forced landing on a dirt road approximately 1/4 mile from the runway.  The airplane was substantially damaged when it landed hard in a 5- to 10-degree bank and skidded to a stop.  The pilot had departed the El Monte airport on the left main tank.  After burning 10.1 gallons from the left tank, he switched to the auxiliary tank over Baker, California, which is approximately halfway between El Monte and Las Vegas.  He continued on the auxiliary tank for the remainder of the flight.  The right tank was not used.  As he approached the airport for landing, he verified that the fuel selector was in the auxiliary position, and believed that he should have had about 13 gallons remaining.  The airplane was equipped with a Shadin fuel management system, indicating fuel flow, gallons used, and gallons remaining.  The fuel management system data indicated that the airplane had used 19.6 gallons total, at a rate of 12.7 gallons per hour on average.  The two main tanks hold 20 gallons of fuel each totaling 40 gallons, of which 34 are useable.  The interconnected auxiliary tanks hold an additional 20 gallons.  The fuel flow was set to 12.2 to 12.6 gallons per hour during the cruise portion of the flight.  The fuel injection system returns about 10 gallons per hour of excess fuel.  Fuel return lines are routed through the selector valve to each main cell; except for the auxiliary cells, fuel is returned to the cell from which it is drawn.  The auxiliary cells return fuel to the left main cell only.  The pilot had burned 10.1 gallons from the left main tank prior to switching to the auxiliary tank, and then an additional 9.4 gallons was used from the auxilliary tank.  However, 19.4 gallons would have actually been withdrawn from the auxiliary tank.  The additional fuel was routed to the left main tank, which was then filled back up to capacity.  This left only 4/10  gallon in the auxiliary tanks, which is to be used in level flight only, and never for takeoff or landing.","The pilot's failure to comply with the airplane flight manual, resulting in fuel starvation and subsequent forced landing on rough terrain."

The airplane was approximately 10 miles west of the airport at 4,000 feet msl, and indicating 220 knots of airspeed, when the captain felt an abnormal yaw input.  At first, he thought the yaw dampener had failed.  He selected the dampener to ""OFF,"" but did not regain normal rudder control.  The captained continued the approach, and landed uneventfully.  An inspection by maintenance personnel revealed that the right aft rudder cable had separated.  The cable was change 50.6 hours before the incident.  The incident rudder cable met its original design specifications, and had separated in overload created by a bend or kink in the cable.  Examination of the cable guide revealed a shiny wear pattern with no scrapes or gouges.  The break in the rudder cable was within 1 inch of the aft cable guide for the right aft rudder pulley.  Two separate incidents involving flight control cables being improperly installed over a cable guide were examined.  In both cases, the cables separated, but the cable guides remained intact.

The helicopter came to a hover over a helicopter-dolly in preparation for landing.  The wind was to the front right of the helicopter as the pilot lowered the collective.  As the helicopter touched down, the pilot felt that the right skid was not properly situated on the dolly.  When he increased collective to reposition the helicopter, it rolled to the right, and impacted the ground.  About 15 minutes after the accident, a weather facility located approximately 3 miles to the southeast of the accident site, recorded the wind as 8 knots.  According to FAA AC 90-87, if a rolling moment is allowed to develop while one skid is in contact with the ground, a helicopter can exceed its critical rollover angle, and roll onto its side.

The flight instructor, who was sitting in the right seat, was demonstrating his short-field landing technique to the owner of the aircraft. Just as the aircraft touched down, it encountered a dust devil/whirlwind. The rotational force imparted to the aircraft by the whirlwind made it hard to control at its low forward speed. The instructor pilot elected not to execute a go-around, and even with both rudder and differential brake application, he was not able to keep the aircraft from departing the side of the runway. After it departed the runway, the aircraft encountered soft, sandy terrain, and nosed over onto its back.",The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll.

Upon arrival at Redmond, the pilot was instructed to enter traffic for runway 28.  On his first landing attempt, he bounced ""moderately"" and decided to go around.  He reported that on his second approach, winds had increased and were variable.  He stated that on this approach, the flare and initial rollout went well but that ""the continuing rollout swerved to the left and did not respond well to correction.""  The pilot therefore decided to go around again, stating in his accident report:  ""Although I was unsure at the time whether I made contact or avoided a runway light, evidence on the aircraft indicates that a contact did occur.""  The pilot reported that at this point, he contacted the tower and told them that he was having trouble with crosswind on runway 28.  The control tower then offered runway 4.  The pilot stated that on the third approach, ""I placed the aircraft with good speed control at the center of the runway while holding against a moderate crosswind from the left"", but that ""Within a few feet...a crosswind (seemingly quartering tailwind) from the right lifted the right wing"", and that the aircraft then ""arced immediately to the left"" and subsequently ground looped at low speed.  The aircraft's tailwheel collapsed during the ground loop.  The pilot stated that at the approximate time of the accident, ""two windsocks were visible indicating moderately strong winds in 180 degree opposite directions on the same runway.""  According to a special weather observation taken at Redmond at 1310, winds were variable between 280 and 010 degrees true at 8 knots.",The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during landing.

The pilot said they were dispatched on a routine cloud-seeding mission at 2250.  All flight operations through takeoff were normal.  The pilot said that after passing through 50 feet agl, the airplane would not climb.  The pilot said he verified power on both engines and airspeed of 120 mph.  He brought the gear up and the climb performance improved slightly.  The pilot said, ""The maximum altitude achieved was just below 3,100 feet msl (100 feet agl), as the rapidly increasing downdrafts from the invisible microburst soon overpowered any climb performance, and quickly pushed the aircraft downward as the VSI (vertical speed indicator) indication transitioned from slightly positive to 150+ fpm (feet per minute) negative.""  The pilot said the airplane's engines were at maximum power when they struck a tree approximately 1 mile from the departure end of the runway.  The pilot said he pitched the nose up in preparation for the ground impact.  The airplane broke free of the tree.  The pilot said he leveled the wings, lowered the nose slightly to keep his speed up, and reduced the throttles to idle.  The airplane touched down about 3 to 5 seconds after their collision with the tree.  The pilot said that 1 minute after the crash, heavy rain from a thunderstorm occurred.

The pilot and an observer were performing fire patrol near Freemont, Michigan.  They were proceeding east at approximately 2,500 feet mean sea level when the pilot noticed the manifold pressure had dropped to approximately 30 inches of Mercury (Hg).  The pilot said he moved the throttle in and out several times but the power did not change.  The pilot executed a 180-degree turn toward the Freemont Airport.  On completion of the turn, the pilot noticed the manifold pressure had dropped to 15 inches Hg.  The pilot looked for a place to land.  He said there was nothing in front of them but trees.  The pilot then noticed a farm field beneath and to the left of him.  He said he decided to put the airplane down in the field.  The pilot said he left the wheels and the flaps up because he was ""low, slow, and short"".  He said the farm field was a short one.  The pilot said he tried to flare.  They hit the ground hard.  The pilot said he did not recall the airplane going over its nose and coming to rest on its back.  An examination of the airplane's engine revealed the throttle cable broken at the linkage to the throttle box lever arm.  No other anomalies were found with the airplane.","The broken throttle cable during cruise flight and the pilot's inadequate flare during the forced landing attempt.  Factors relating to this accident were the low airspeed during the forced landing attempt and the short, corn stubble field."

The twin-engine helicopter departed on a positioning flight to pick up a medical patient.  While in cruise flight, at 2,000 feet, both engines experienced a total loss of power.  The pilot attempted to autorotate to a field; however, the helicopter impacted trees and came to rest on its right side.  The pilot reported that he did not notice any warning lights immediately prior to or during the loss of engine power events.  However, it was noted during a post-accident examination of the helicopter that the pilot instrument light and console light variable resistor control was in the ON position.  This control dims the master caution and annunciator panel lights for night operations.  The NTSB IIC noted that the master caution and annunciator lights were not visible in daylight with the pilot and console variable resistor control in the ON position.  Although the two fuel transfer pump switches were found in the ON (normal operating) position, examination of the fuel system provided evidence that the dual engine power loss was the result of fuel starvation due to these switches not being ON during the majority of the flight.  The fuel supply lines to the engines were found empty, a nominal amount of fuel was found in the fuel filters, and  the fuel quantity indicator displayed 4, 0, and 15 gallons of fuel in the #1 supply, #2 supply, and forward main fuel tanks, respectively.  The function of the fuel transfer pumps is to transfer fuel from the forward main tank to the two supply tanks.  The fuel transfer pumps were operated during the post-accident examination by turning on their respective switches and it was noted that fuel began to flow into the supply tanks.  Additionally, it was noted that the fuel transfer pump caution lights (which are illuminated when the pumps are off) extinguished when the pumps were turned on.  The engines were placed in a test cell and both operated with no anomalies noted.   The normal operating checklist calls, in part, for the pilot to set the instrument lights as required, test the annunciator panel for operation, and turn on the transfer pumps after engine start.","the pilot's failure to follow the checklist and turn on the fuel transfer pumps, which resulted in fuel starvation and a dual loss of engine power while in cruise flight."

The airplane collided with a wind turbine following an in-flight separation of the majority of the right canard and all of the right elevator.  The accident occurred in an area that commonly had turbulent conditions.  The airplane fragmented; the right canard and elevator were not in the main debris field, and were found about 1/2 mile from the main wreckage.  The canard and elevator damage was not symmetrical.  The left side remained intact and attached to the fuselage while the right side separated near the fuselage attachment points.  All that remained of the right canard was the top skin, which had scattered patches of paint missing.  The owner and the pilot built the airplane together.  They acquired pieces for the airplane from different sources, and assembled the airplane.  The owner did not recall who actually built the elevator.  They obtained advice and technical suggestions from various builders of the model at their home field.  They did not contact the kit manufacturer during construction.  The kit manufacturer maintained close contact with builders through newsletters and a company website.  They designed an improvement to the elevator, which incorporated a wider chord.  They recommended that owners make the change if they had not flown their airplane.  The manufacturer provided a full size diagram so that builders could physically place their piece on top of the drawing to insure that their manufactured piece conformed to the drawing.  The accident elevator did not conform to the kit manufacturer's instructions.  In a newsletter to builders, the manufacturer informed them that the airplanes would be difficult or even dangerous to fly if the elevators did not have the correct cross section.  The kit manufacturer repeatedly stressed the importance of the correct shape, weight, and balance of the elevators in their newsletters.  On two occasions, once in 1979 and again in 1988, they noted that builders had installed balance weights in improper locations.  In one case the builder experienced flutter, and investigation determined that he added weight to balance a reconstructed elevator.  Instead of dividing the added weight between inboard and outboard mass balance points, he placed them all on the inboard point.  The manufacturer noted that this was incorrect, and that the balance weights should not all be installed inboard.  They stated that any variance of weight, stiffness, or shape from recommended design specifications should be considered dangerous, and builders should discard elevators that did not conform.  The accident airplane had a large number of balance weights, and all of them were at the inboard mass balance point.",the failure of the builder to balance the elevators per the kit manufacturer's instructions resulting in flutter and in-flight separation of the right elevator.

The pilot got out of the helicopter with the engines running and the rotors turning to check on the security of a cabin door, and the unmanned helicopter began moving on the helipad and rolled over.  The pilot had completed a nightime, helicopter, air taxi flight, and was preparing to depart the elevated helipad to reposition the helicopter to the operator's base.  After deplaning his passengers the pilot returned to the cockpit and was preparing to depart when he noticed a door unsecured indication on the instrument panel for the left cabin door.  The passengers had deplaned through the right-hand door and the left door annunciation had not been on during the inbound flight.  He thought one of the passengers might have released the left door latch inadvertently while preparing to deplane.  He idled the engines and exited the cockpit to check the door.  He reclosed the door and returned to the cockpit; however, the door open annunciation came on again.  He recalled leaving the cockpit ""2 or 3 times"" to deal with the door and said he was ""frustrated with it.""  He did not recall retarding the engine power control levers to ground idle before leaving the cockpit the final time.  While out of the cockpit, the wheel-equipped helicopter started to move as the pilot was returning to the cockpit.  He recalled it was moving toward the edge of the helipad.  He returned to the cockpit; however, before he could regain control there was a confusing sequence of events and the next thing he knew the helicopter was on its side.  The pilot reported there were no mechanical discrepancies with the helicopter up to the time of the event.  He remarked that it was very light [weight] with no one else on board.

During cruise flight, the engine lost power, followed by an off-airport forced landing.  The airplane collided with obstacles on the ground.  The pilot, who was receiving flight following advisories, reported a loss of engine oil pressure to the air traffic controller.  During the flight's diversion to an airport, the engine continued to lose power and the pilot was unable to maintain altitude and reach the divert airport.  Local police reported that the pilot  subsequently returned to the airplane, chopped it up with an axe, and transported it from the site in a truck.  Subsequently, repair personnel examined the engine noting that the number three cylinder head had separated from the cylinder barrel allowing the engine oil to drain from the engine during flight.  Engine records indicated the last engine overhaul was January 1988.  The pilot reported the engine had 1,275 hours since overhaul with 38 hours since the airplane's last annual inspection in May 2001.","The separation of the number three cylinder head from the barrel resulting in a loss of engine oil during flight.

The flight instructor stated that he was demonstrating an autorotation to his student when the accident occurred.  He said that he initiated a straight in autorotation to runway 30 at 600 feet above ground level (agl).  The descent rate was stabilized until 200 feet agl, when he felt a sudden increase in the rate of descent.  He began the flare at 50 feet agl.  He stated that the vertical speed did not decrease at the rate he was accustomed to, resulting in a hard landing.  He stated that the tail boom hit the ground first in a right yawing moment.  The helicopter then rolled to the right, crushing the right skid, severing the tail boom, and allowing the rotor blades to contact the ground.  He noted that no mechanical problems existed with the helicopter during the flight.  He did not notice any mechanical anomalies during the autorotation demonstration.  He stated that the engine was running normally during the autorotation and the landing flare.  The pilot stated that wind shear may have been a factor.

The pilot stated that while en route from Van Nuys to Mammoth Yosemite (MMH) via the Friant VOR radial 023, he entered a canyon and later realized that he had entered the wrong one.  He said that the canyon was closed and above his altitude.  He also stated that he was experiencing moderate turbulence from the time he entered the canyon up to the accident.  The pilot began a ""full power climb"" at 75 knots in an attempt to clear the ridgeline at the end of the canyon.  When he realized that he would not clear the terrain, he began a steep left turn.  During the turn, the stall warning was activated and the pilot lowered the nose and shallowed the bank angle.  He stated that the airplane struck trees on the top of the canyon edge, tearing off the left wing with the airplane striking the ground in a level attitude.  He stated that, ""The engine was working properly and all the gauges were in the green.""  According to the San Francisco sectional chart, the Mammoth Pool Reservoir, which is 55 nautical miles southwest of the MMH airport on a magnetic bearing of 213 degrees, is directly under the 023-degree radial of the Friant VOR.  The pilot stated that when he saw the reservoir, he turned east toward the MMH airport.  The magnetic course from the reservoir to the MMH airport was 033 degrees, or a northeasterly direction.  There was a canyon leading northeast from the Mammoth Pool Reservoir along the Friant 023-degree radial, which is also Victor 230.  The canyon terminated at Mammoth Lakes, which is 11 miles due west of the MMH airport.  Had the pilot followed Victor 230 until reaching the Mammoth Pools, then turned to an easterly heading, he would have been proceeding directly to the airport.",The pilot's inadequate in-flight planning and his failure to maintain sufficient altitude above the terrain.  Factors were the high terrain and the blind canyon.

The pilot had left the airplane at Asheville on the day before the accident due to low cloud ceilings and visibility at Mountain Air Airport, his destination, and completed the trip by rental car. On the day of the accident the pilot returned the rental car and at 1656 departed Asheville in N396PM, enroute to Mountain Air Airport, 27 miles north of Asheville. The last radio contact with the pilot was at 1701:44, when the pilot told controllers at Asheville that he was in visual flight rule conditions, at 4,000 feet. The last radar contact with the flight was by FAA Atlanta Center, at 1704:00, when the flight was about 5 miles south of the accident site at 3,800 feet. The flight did not arrive at the destination, an emergency locator transmitter signal was received by satellite, and search and rescue operations were begun. The pilot and the wreckage of the airplane was located the next day about 1400. The airplane had collided with 75-foot tall trees, at about the 4,800-foot msl level on the side of Bullhead Mountain, while in a wings level attitude, while on a 170 degree heading. After the initial impact the airplane continued for another 300 feet, causing general breakup of the airplane. The main wreckage came to rest on a northerly heading. All components of the airplane were located at the crash site and there was no evidence of precrash failure or malfunction of the airplane structure, flight controls, airplane systems, engine, or propeller. A witness reported that the weather near the time of the accident on the Blue Ridge Parkway, located about 3/4 mile to the west of the crash site, was very foggy.  Satellite images show clouds were present at the crash site and the Asheville airport, located 20 miles south-southwest of the crash site, reported overcast clouds 2,600 feet agl or 4,765 feet msl, and visibility 4 miles in haze, at the time of the accident.

The pilot reported that he departed in a flight of two for the local flight at an antique biplane show, since his airplane did not have a radio and the airport's control  tower was in operation at the time.  The pilot stated that on the landing approach, the lead aircraft slowed to allow another aircraft to clear the runway, which decreased the spacing between the two aircraft in the formation.  He reported that he was approximately 100 to 150 yards behind the lead aircraft at touchdown on 3,059-foot by 75-foot asphalt runway 21L, which he reported was dry at the time.  The pilot reported that the touchdown was normal, ""but after a couple hundred feet of ground roll I encountered the wake turbulence of the lead [aircraft].""  The pilot stated that he became unable to maintain directional control in the lead aircraft's wake turbulence, with the aircraft ""veering left [and] right"".  The pilot stated that on a veer to the left, the right landing gear failed, and that the right wing then contacted the ground.  The pilot indicated on his NTSB accident report that no mechanical failure or malfunction was involved in the accident.  The pilot reported winds at the time as being from 160 degrees at 9 knots, and the 1553 Felts Field METAR observation reported winds as variable at 5 knots.","The pilot landed with insufficient formation spacing behind the lead aircraft, resulting in an encounter with the lead aircraft's wake turbulence, and subsequently lost directional control during landing roll."

The two pilots were conducting a high speed taxi test run when the bi-wing, experimental, amateur-built airplane inadvertently took off.  Witnesses observed the tandem-seat airplane make a ""sharp turn to the left"", ""stall,"" impact terrain and catch fire.  During the brief flight, witnesses heard a surging noise.  The airplane had never been flown before and had been issued an experimental airworthiness certificate two months prior to the accident.  According to people at the airport, the front seat pilot had been working on the airplane for over a year and had never flown it.  They added that the propeller governor had been removed and reinstalled a few days prior to the accident.  The rear seat pilot stated that it was his understanding that the airplane was not supposed to takeoff.  Toxicology tests on the front seat pilot revealed 0.05 ug/ml of diphenhydramine in the pilot's blood, an unquantified amount of diphenhydramine in the liver, and 1.076 ug/ml of acetaminophen in the pilot's blood.  Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter pain reliever commonly known by the trade name Tylenol.  Diphenhydramine is an over-the-counter antihistamine.

The student pilot was maneuvering during a solo flight on a warm, humid day.   He performed steep turns, and climbs and descents to maintain cloud clearance.  He described numerous power changes, and intermittent use of carburetor heat.  The airplane experienced a partial loss of engine power, and the student pilot tried various combinations of throttle, mixture and carburetor heat to restore engine power. The student pilot said, ""I pulled the carburetor heat all the way on, and it started to run real rough, so I pushed it back in.""  Engine power continued to decrease, but the engine continued to run at idle power until the airplane contacted trees during the forced landing.  Examination of the engine after the accident revealed that the power controls were attached and intact, and that the throttle, mixture, and carburetor heat controls all operated throughout their respective ranges without binding.  A small fuel can was plumbed into the fuel system, and the engine started and ran on the airframe without interruption.  Interpolation of an FAA Icing Probability Chart revealed that atmospheric conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to serious icing at glide power.",The student pilot's improper use of carburetor heat.

The pilot departed on a cross-country flight in an experimental airplane.  While climbing through 8,000 ft, the engine lost manifold pressure, and the pilot was unable to restore climb power.  He headed toward a nearby airport, and planned on a straight-in approach.  Due to the low altitude of the airplane, he elected to hold the landing gear until he was close to the runway.  When he extended the landing gear, there was insufficient time for full extension, and the airplane touched down about 100 feet short of the runway, with partial landing gear extension.  Examination of the airplane revealed the remains of a paper towel in the turbocharger and intercooler.  The pilot had completed his phase 1 flight time requirements and the accident flight was the first flight following an inspection in which the engine cowling had been removed.  Paper towels were used as wipes on both the engine and airframe.  The pilot was assisted by several persons, some of whom were not rated aviation mechanics.  The pilot later reported that a paper towel had inadvertently been left on top of the engine.  The airplane was powered by a converted automotive V-8 engine.  The engine was equipped with an air filter.  However, there was also a 5-inch by 10-inch opening on the back of the engine which allowed unfiltered air into the air intake manifold.","A partial blockage of the air intake system, due to the pilot's failure to ensure the engine compartment was clear of paper towels after a maintenance inspection."

While landing, the pilot began to flare the airplane about 20-30 feet above the runway.  The CFI informed the pilot that they were too high and he should lower the nose; however, the pilot did not respond.  Before the CFI could take corrective action, the airplane touched down hard on the main landing gear, and bounced back into the air.  Deciding that she wanted to see if the pilot could regain control of the airplane, the CFI elected not to take corrective action.  The pilot added full power and pulled back on the yoke until the airplane entered a stall.  The CFI assumed the flight controls and pushed forward on the control yoke with both hands.  The left wing of the airplane then struck the ground, and the CFI aborted the go-around.  The airplane touched down hard on the runway again, collapsing the right main and nose landing gear, departed the left side of the runway, and came to rest in a grass field.","The flight instructor's failure to maintain control of the airplane during an aborted landing, and her delay in remedial action.  A factor related to the accident was the excessive trim setting."

According to witnesses, the airplane was circling a golf course and then began to climb, shortly after climbing to an undetermined altitude,  the airplane went into a nose down slow spin and impacted into a stand of trees. On July 22, 2001, the other two owners of the airplane had inspected the control surface lock (gust Lock) by moving it from the lock/unlock position several times. The reason for the inspection was in preparation for the upcoming annual inspection. According to the owners, they could not recall if they had stowed it in the unlock position when they had finished their inspection. During the course of flight control examination it was found that the handle for the operation of the control surface lock, which secures the rudder, ailerons and elevator, was installed in each cockpit, and was found in the locked position. The locking handle in the forward cockpit area was found separated from its mounting bracket. When placed in its proper orientation to the fracture surface it was found to be in the locked position. Injuries sustained by the pilot rated passengers left arm were consistant with the damage to the forward control lock. The aft control lock was found intact and in the down and locked position.   According to the Pilots Flight Operating Instructions, during pre-flight inspection,  the control lock should be in the lock position during startup and taxi, and disengaged and stowed into the unlock position just prior to takeoff.",The inadvertent activation of the flight control gust locks by the pilot rated passenger that resulted in the loss of control inflight. Contributing was the pilot in commands failure to follow the airplane's pre-flight inspection check list.

Witnesses reported hearing the airplane's engine quit operating and observed the airplane gliding towards an open field.  The witnesses stated the airplane entered a steep turn, stalled, and impacted the terrain.  Witnesses who responded to the accident site reported there was fuel present in all three fuel tanks.  No anomalies were found with the flight control systems that could be associated with any pre-impact condition.  The fuel system was modified from the kit-supplied construction drawings. The two main fuel tanks were vented through their handles using flexible tubing.  The two vent lines initiating from the tank handles combined at a T-fitting and a single flexible vent line was run from the fitting down between the fuel tanks.  The terminating end of the vent line was cut perpendicular to the line and the vent line was not secured.  The two main fuel tanks were mounted on a metal tray lined with a flexible neoprene pad.  The unsecured vent line was able to move along the bottom of the tray and make contact with the neoprene liner. The engine was mounted on a test stand and was configured with the original aircraft's fuel filter, fuel pump, gascolator, and pulse pump.  The engine started without any anomalies.  The engine developed full power at 6,500 rpm during the full throttle test.  Both ignition systems functioned without any anomalies.  No anomalies were found with the engine or its related systems that could be associated with any pre-impact condition.","The loss of engine power due to fuel starvation caused by a blocked, unsecured, fuel vent line.

The pilot approached runway 20 from the left to compensate for a crosswind.  However, at the point of touchdown, the airplane encountered a strong gust from the west, and the pilot did not have enough rudder authority to correct for the crosswind.  The airplane traveled off the right side of the runway and ""ground-looped"", which resulted in substantial damage to the left main landing gear and left wing.  The winds reported at Laconia Airport, Laconia, New Hampshire, at 1235, were from 230 degrees at 14 knots, gusting to 19 knots.

Upon reaching the destination airport on a dark, nighttime cross-country flight, the pilot's approach was too high and fast, so he performed a go-around.  On his second approach, the pilot was also too high, but the airplane touched down on the 4,200-foot-long runway.  Concerned about being able to stop before reaching the runway's departure end, the pilot added full engine power and tried to go around.  The engine power increased normally.  During the initial climb out, the pilot experienced difficulty controlling the airplane.  Contrary to Cessna's published recommended balked landing procedure, the pilot failed to retract the wing flaps from their 40-degrees setting.  The airspeed was slow, the airplane stalled, and it impacted trees and terrain.  About 1.5 months earlier, the pilot was issued a private pilot certificate.  The accident occurred during the pilot's first, solo, night cross-country flight, and his total pilot-in-command night experience was 1.5 hours.","Inadequate airspeed during climb out following an aborted landing that was precipitated by the pilot's misjudged speed/distance on final approach.

The fuel tanks were filled to capacity (102 gallons useable), and the pilot departed about 1915.  Prior to reaching his first intended airport, the pilot switched from the right fuel tank to the left fuel tank.  He then performed one practice instrument approach, and flew toward the second intended airport.  About 2 hours 5 minutes into the flight, at 4,500 feet over the Atlantic Ocean, the engine lost all power.  The pilot turned toward the nearest airport, transmitted an emergency distress message on 121.5 Mhz, and tried an engine restart using the emergency procedures.  The pilot was unable to restart the engine, and he ditched in the Atlantic Ocean.  Due to the depth of water, the wreckage was not recovered.  The pilot reported that there was no sputtering or roughness with the engine prior to the total loss of engine power.  He further stated that he had plenty of fuel on board, and usually burned 17-18 gallons-per-hour in cruise flight at 4,500 feet msl.",A total loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.

While cruising at 1,000 feet above the ground, the helicopter encountered an area of strong updrafts and downdrafts. As it passed through one particularly strong downdraft, the aircraft experienced a complete loss of power. The pilot then initiated an autorotation to the only available landing area. Because the area was small and surrounded by trees, the pilot found it necessary to execute an abrupt flare in order to arrest the forward movement of the helicopter prior to colliding with the trees ahead. The abrupt flare resulted in a hard landing, and the main rotor blades flexed downward far enough to sever the tail boom. Post-accident inspections of the engine and aircraft systems did not reveal any malfunctions or anomalies that would have been expected to contribute to a loss of power. Although the flight manual warned of possible fuel starvation associated with large side slip angles of uncoordinated flight with less than 35 pounds of fuel remaining, approximately 115 pounds of fuel were drained from the helicopter's main fuel bladder.","The complete loss of engine power at cruise for undetermined reasons. Factors include a landing area that was restricted/confined due to adjacent trees, and an intentional abrupt flare resulting in a hard landing."

An off duty flight attendant received a broken ankle when the airplane encountered moderate turbulence during descent.  The captain reported the seat belt sign had been turned on and a passenger announcement was made regarding the likelyhood of encountering turbulence.  The captain reported that light turbulence was encountered followed by moderate turbulence between an altitude of 18,000 feet and 12,000 feet.  The injured off duty flight attendant reported, ""Just before the descent began into Detroit, several passengers went to the lavatory and returned with no difficulty.  I chose to give all other passengers the opportunity to go before I did.  The flight was continuing smoothly as I made my way from my seat on the right side of the exit row, aft to the lavatory.  While returning to my seat, the aircraft began to encounter some moderate turbulence as is normal while descending.   I held to the seat backs to support myself as I walked forward toward my seat.  As I neared my seat, the aircraft encountered a severe pocket of air with absolutely no warning whatsoever.  I was lifted into the air as the aircraft dipped, then falling to the floor of the cabin.

The helicopter was climbing eastbound after liftoff and was passing 300 feet agl when the crew heard a loud squeal and felt a high frequency vibration in the airframe and in the antitorque control pedals.  The pilot executed a 180-degree turn and landed back at the helipad.  The NOTAR fan drive system was disassembled for examination.  The Aft Tube Assembly transmits antitorque pedal inputs to the NOTAR fan blade pitch change mechanism and moves fore and aft through the hollow rotating fan drive shaft.  The tube does not rotate.  Three distinct areas of circumferential scoring were noted on the tube; one in the center at roughly the middle of the drive shaft, and one at each end of the tube corresponding to locations just within the fan drive gear box on the forward end and just inside of the fan assembly.  The pilot reported that during an earlier flight in the accident helicopter, the antitorque pedals seemed to stick or slightly bind with 2 inches of right pedal displacement.  The pilot stated that this was an annoying problem that regularly occurred with all the 520N's in their fleet, and that the maintenance department typically cleared it up by cleaning (lightly sanding) a Teflon coated sliding tube in the NOTAR fan assembly.  According to the pilot, dirt and oil would get on this sliding tube and cause it to bind in the housing, and the mechanics would simply clean this tube to resolve the problem.  Maintenance department mechanics confirmed that the pedal-sticking problem typically involved foreign material on the aft tubes' Teflon coated pitch slider, and that they routinely resolved the discrepancies by removing the aft tube and lightly sanding the Teflon coating with fine sand paper.   With the exception of the aft tube and it's associated pitch slider shaft, extensive examinations and tests of the NOTAR system components revealed no anomalies that could be related to the vibratory event.  Examination of the pitch slider shaft found numerous, very fine, axial scratches on the surface, and measurements found that the outer diameter had been reduced by up to 0.014 inch from the manufacturer's specified constant 0.818 inch (+0.001 inch).  The hand sanding of the liner resulted in axial surface scratches and a variable shaft outer diameter that was smaller than that required by the MDHI specification.  The decreased and variable liner OD degraded the ability to isolate the aft tube assembly from drive system vibrations.  The bending mode natural frequencies of the aft tube assembly were assessed to be 65, 220, and 450 Hz.  Initial MDHI estimates stated that the first bending mode natural frequency of the aft tube assembly was 94 Hz.  The operational rotor speed of the MDHI 520N helicopter is 7.95 Hz, and the operational NOTAR fan and drive system rotational speed is 89.4 Hz.  While in comparison, the measured first bending mode natural frequency of the aft tube assembly of 65 Hz offers a margin of 24.4 Hz under the 89.4 Hz operating speed of the NOTAR fan drive syste;, the actual natural frequency may be higher and result in a smaller margin.  The investigation determined that a maintenance practice of sanding the Teflon coated pitch slider tube in the NOTAR assembly resulted in excessive clearance between the antitorque system components.  This excessive clearance allowed a vibration to occur in those components resulting in the noise and airframe vibrations noted by the pilots.",the excitation of the first bending mode natural frequency of the aft tube assembly that is installed through the rotating NOTAR fan drive system.  Contributing factors to the incident included the operator's maintenance practice of hand-sanding the pitch slider component of the NOTAR fan system.

The pilot stated that he started a descent into the area heading east into the wind, and down to 300 feet. He said he made several passes, and on the last pass he made a left turn, and had started turning to the right when the aircraft developed a fast yaw to the right, indicative of imminent loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE). The pilot said he immediately reduced collective and nosed the aircraft forward, and started losing altitude fast with no significant improvement in the yaw rate to the right. He said he pulled power to arrest the descent rate, and the yaw rate got faster, and he made a forced landing between two houses, pulling power at the bottom to arrest the descent rate. During the forced landing, the right skid touched down on the side of the roof, the aircraft then rolled left and came down to the ground. The pilot said that  prior to the accident, there had been no mechanical failure or malfunction to the aircraft, or to any of its systems.","the pilot's failure to recognize and correct for unanticipated right yaw/loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) during an approach to hover at a low altitude, which resulted in a loss of control and the helicopter descending and colliding with a house and the ground."

During takeoff, when the airplane was about 200 feet above the ground, the engine experienced a partial loss of engine power and the pilot was not able to maintain altitude.  The pilot performed a forced landing to a grass area northwest of the runway; however the airplane struck trees and a fence.  Examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any pre-impact failures.  Fuel consistent with aviation gasoline was observed throughout the airplane's fuel system, and no evidence of contamination was noted.  Additionally, the engine was started and ran uneventfully; however, due to damaged engine mounts, the rpm was not increased above 1,300.

While attempting a full-stop landing, the pilot allowed the aircraft to drop onto the runway surface with enough force that it bounced back into the air. The pilot then continued the landing sequence, and the aircraft hit hard enough on the second touchdown that it once again bounced back into the air. On its third touchdown it hit nose wheel first, damaging the airframe, and bouncing back into the air a third time. On the fourth touchdown, it contacted the terrain off the side of the runway,  and eventually came to a stop. After the first and second touchdowns, the pilot did not add power to cushion the next contact as called for in FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 61-21A, nor, as called for in the same AC, did he make the decision to execute a go-around when it became obvious that his attempt to salvage the landing was not meeting success. An improperly serviced nose wheel strut may have contributed to the severity of the damage.","The pilot's inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, and his improper remedial action after it became clear that he was not successfully salvaging the landing attempt. Factors include an improperly serviced nose gear strut."

The airplane sustained minor damage when it nosed over during an emergency landing following an in-flight loss of a propeller blade tip.  The pilot was uninjured.  The pilot stated, ""While on a actual spray run the aircraft began to shake and vibrate violently.  At that time I shut the power down, climbed about 100 ft to look for a place to land.  The area was rolling with pasture land and a corn field in front of me, no roads to land on in the area.  ...  After a rolling out for a short while in corn the landing gear became stuck in corn and soft sandy soil.""  A portion of the remaining blade, including the separation, was shipped to the NTSB's Materials Laboratory Division.  The laboratory's report stated that ""a large portion of the fracture surface was on a 90-degree flat plane with multiple ratchet marks and crack arrest marks on this portion of the fracture surface.  These features are typical of a fatigue crack.  The fatigue crack originated from multiple origins at the bottom of a gouge on the flat face of the blade about 2.25 inches from the blade's leading edge.  The fatigue crack extended through about two-thirds of the blade's cross-section.  The remainder of the fracture surface (about one-third of the blade's cross section) was on a 45-degree slanted plane and was typical of an overstress region stemming from the fatigue crack.""  A section was saw cut from the fracture containing the fatigue origin.  The paint was removed from the areas near the crack origin and the surface was re-examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).  The gouge was measured using the SEM.

According to the pilot, after takeoff, he climbed to 9,700 feet msl in order to cross the mountains. The airplane then encountered a ""300 foot updraft, and then a 2,000 foot downdraft."" He decided to ""land the plane without the use of the landing gear on the side of the mountain."" One of the passengers said it was the pilot's first mountain flying experience. He remembered the airplane was at 80 knots and 8,300 feet as they approached a mountain. He said the pilot pulled back on the control yoke in an attempt to gain sufficient altitude to clear the peak but the airplane was slow in responding and  ""we literally came straight down"" and ""the belly [struck the ground] pretty hard."" According to rescue personnel, the accident site was at 8,510 feet. The straight line distance between the airport and the accident site was 9 nm. The difference in accident elevation and airport elevation (8,510 - 7,673) was 837 feet. The computed climb rate was 93 feet per nm. Estimated airplane weight was 2,670 pounds at takeoff (maximum certificated gross weight is 2,650 pounds). The altimeter setting was 30.49 inches of mercury, and the computed pressure altitude was 7,103 feet msl. Referring to the Cessna 172RG ""Maximum Rate of Climb"" chart and interpolating, it was computed that the airplane was capable of achieving a climb rate of 464 fpm (feet per minute) and, at a climb speed of 79 knots, it was capable of climbing 352.4 feet per nm.","the pilot's failure to attain the proper climb rate, and his improper inflight planning/decision to attempt to cross mountainous terrain at an inadequate altitude.

The airplane was on a left downwind leg for landing on runway 30 when the pilot noticed a strong 90 degree southwest crosswind.  On final approach, the airplane was in ""a serious side slip configuration (aileron hard left, right rudder).""  The left wheel touched down.  Just before the right wheel touched down, a strong wind gust from the southwest lifted the airplane back into the air, and the pilot decided to abort the landing.  He added full power and lowered the nose since the stall warning was sounding.  He felt the airplane touch down twice in dirt, and bounce twice.  Thereafter, his only recollection of the accident was spinning around and coming to a halt in a ditch.  The recorded winds at a location 6 nautical miles northwest of the accident site were from 230 degrees at 14 knots gusting to 18 knots.",the pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions which resulted in a loss of control during landing.

The flight departed and was in cruise at 7,200 feet ""above the cloud tops,"" receiving visual flight rules (VFR) flight following, when the pilot stated that he observed ""holes in the cloud layer"" and, subsequently, commenced a descent.  Radar data revealed that the airplane was in a stable descent for 5 minutes.  During the ensuing 7 final minutes of the flight, the airplane made multiple ""S"" patterns and its altitude varied between 3,400 feet and 2,600 feet.  Witnesses observed the airplane fly in and out of the clouds and, subsequently, enter a spiraling descent prior to impacting the ground.  The pilot received a weather briefing prior to the accident flight, during which the briefer advised the pilot of forecast conditions including, scattered clouds between three and five thousand feet, occasionally scattered to broken clouds between eight and ten thousand feet, a 30% chance of thunderstorms and rain showers, and possible lingering pockets of instrument flight rules (IFR) weather conditions.  The closest weather observation facility (15 miles northwest of the accident site) reported broken cloud layers at 2,000 feet, 2,800 feet, and 3,500 feet, and a visibility of 10 miles near the time of the accident.

The pilot departed the grass strip at his home for a local flight.  Neighbors said the airplane over-flew their home at treetop level, and then descended over a cliff into a creek bed headed downstream.  At the point where the witnesses said the airplane entered the creek bed, the distance from the top of the trees at the edge of the cliff to the surface of the water was about 200 feet.  The airplane continued down stream and struck a pair of unmarked, parallel wires suspended approximately 50 feet above the surface of the water.  The witnesses said the sound of the engine was smooth and without interruption until the sound of the crash.  Examination of the wreckage revealed no mechanical anomalies.  Witnesses who lived along the river said the airplane made several low-level passes down the creek in the weeks preceding the accident.",The pilot's inadequate decision and his failure to maintain obstacle clearance.

The airplane lost power while on approach to an airport.  The private pilot said that at the time of the loss of engine power the left fuel gauge was still in the mid-range and the right was indicating empty.  According to the airplane's tachometer the total flight time was 5.2 hours, while the Hobbs meter placed the total flight time as 5.7 hours.  With the 10 gallons the pilot added prior to the return leg of the flight, the entire flight's total usable fuel quantity was 34.5 gallons.  The pilot estimated the fuel consumption rate to be 6 or 7 gallons per hour.  Using a 34.5-gallon fuel quantity and the 6- or 7-gallon-per-hour fuel consumption rate, the fuel endurance would have equated to 5 hours 45 minutes, or 4 hours 54 minutes, respectively.

The pilot stated that as the aircraft descended, the engine was operating at 2000 rpm, and the selected manifold pressure was 15 in Hg, and at 8,000 feet he noticed that the engine had ceased operating. Prior to noticing that the engine had ceased operating he said everything had been normal, but as he maneuvered to land he felt he was too far down the runway to land safely, so he elected to perform a go-around. He said that shortly after he made a steep left turn away from the landing runway, the engine ceased operating again, and as he maneuvered to avoid obstacles, the airplane struck the ground in a nose low attitude. He said that he had full flaps applied during the approach to land, and go-around up through the point of impact with the ground.

The non-certificated pilot bought a homebuilt gyroplane.  He returned it to his home and assembled it for flight.  At the completion of his first test flight, he reported that it flew nose heavy.  Without correcting the nose heavy situation, he then departed on a longer flight, and returned to the departure airport after about an hour's absence.  Witnesses saw the gyrocopter make a pass down the runway at reduced power.  During the pass, the nose dropped, the pilot added power, and the nose returned to the horizon.  The pilot then initiated a steep right turn.   During the turn, the nose dropped and the gyrocopter impacted the ground.  Witnesses reported that the pilot had been told to ""hang"" the gyroplane prior to flight to check for proper position of the mast plate.  However, the pilot reported that he had not completed the task.  No maintenance records were available for review.  The pilot did not have a current medical, and his student pilot certificate had expired.  He was taking medication used to treat depression, and he was diabetic.  The designer of the gyroplane reported that flight with a nose heavy gyroplane would reduce the amount of nose up control available to the pilot.  In addition, loss of airspeed in maneuvering, or a power reduction/loss could also induce a nose down attitude.",The pilot's failure to maintain control while maneuvering.  A factor was the pilot's lack of experience in type of gyroplane.

While on final approach the pilot moved the landing gear lever to the extended position, heard the normal sounds of the gear extending and noted that the three green landing gear position lights were illuminated.  However, when he looked at the nose landing gear through the mirror on the left engine cowling, he noted that the nose gear was hanging at a 45-degree angle.  The pilot attempted to cycle the gear, and the nose landing gear did not move.  The pilot executed a go-around.  The pilot attempted to use the emergency gear extension procedure, contacted various maintenance facilities via aircraft radio, and then performed a low fly-by of the air traffic control tower (ATCT).  The ATCT controllers were able to see that the main landing gear appeared to be down and locked; however, the nose landing gear was hanging at a 45-degree angle.  During the ensuing landing, the nose gear collapsed, and the pilot brought the airplane to a stop on the runway.  Examination revealed that the airplane's nose landing gear right drag brace (link assembly) was separated.

The certificated commercial pilot, with five passengers aboard, departed Skagway, Alaska, as the first of two airplanes conducting air tour flights over a national park. The standard route of flight after departure was to proceed southbound, climb over an area of steep mountainous terrain, then descend into an area known as Glacier Bay.  The pilot of the second tour airplane said that it was apparent that low clouds, rain, and fog within the pass would not allow them to fly through the pass.  He said that he and the other pilot discussed optional flight routes.  The accident pilot said that he was going to take a heading of 240 degrees, and fly through to the other side.  The pilot of the second airplane said he replied to the accident pilot that he thought that this was a real bad idea, and that he was not going to follow him.  The second pilot stated that the accident pilot's final radio transmission was, in part:  ""...I'm sure that it's clear on the other side.  I'll see you on the other side.""  No further radio communications were received from the accident airplane.  After being notified of an emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal, a search was initiated about 1600.  Poor weather conditions hampered rescue crews from reaching the accident site.  About 1859, the wreckage was located on an area of steep, snow-covered mountainous terrain.

According to the FAA's transcript of communications, the pilot telephoned the Flight Service Station, requesting a weather briefing and he was told of a developing line of thunderstorms south of Brunswick, Georgia. After the initial briefing, the pilot again called FAA  Flight Service Station for an update, stating ""we were thinking maybe we could make it to Saint Augustine."" In response, the briefer told the pilot that just south of Saint Simons Island, there was a line of level  three to level five thunderstorms developing, and further stated that he would be able to get around the west side of it and possibly down to Saint Augustine. The pilot then filed an instrument flight rules flight plan. The briefer informed the pilot again of the ""weather"" that was south of Saint Simons Island, stating that he was going to need vectors to get around it. and that  he will need to go west of the line of level three to five thunderstorms. At 0902:15, the pilot made initial contact with the Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) Brunswick radar controller, reporting that he was at 6,000 feet, and was given the Brunswick altimeter setting. At 0907:16 the pilot asked if he would be vectored around the ""stuff"" in front of him, and the radar controller acknowledging the heavy weather ahead, gave the pilot a heading of 170 degrees. At  0908:06 the radar controller asked the pilot to let him know if he needed to deviate further east, and at 0910:47 the controller gave the pilot a 160-degree heading. At 0916:16 the radar controller asked  the pilot how the heading of 160 degrees was looking, and the pilot answered that it was looking ""pretty good"", adding that he had just come around some ""stuff"" and was now heading 170 degrees. At 0917:10 the radar controller advised the pilot that the radar showed that he was 300 to 400 feet high, to which the pilot responded that he had just come through some pretty heavy updrafts. The radar controller then advised of additional areas of moderate to heavy precipitation about 10 miles ahead, and told the pilot to let him know if he wanted to deviate further. At 0917:43, the radar controller again notified the pilot of the weather in front of N41EH, and asked if he wished to deviate east of course around the weather, to which the pilot responded asking if he could go west. At 0917:52, the radar controller affirmed that the pilot could go west if he wished, and further said that a 220-degree heading would work, asking the pilot if that heading also looked good to him.  At 0918:02 the pilot affirmed the heading, informing the controller that he was steering 220 degrees.  At 0919:44, the radar controller gave the pilot of N41EH a heading of 210 degrees, and the pilot again acknowledged. At 0919:54, the radar controller instructed the pilot to contact Jacksonville Approach control on  a frequency of 119.0 mHZ, and at 0919:57, the pilot  acknowledged the frequency change. At 0923:11, a Jacksonville Approach controller called the Brunswick radar controller, informing him that N41EH had not checked in with him, and asked the Brunswick radar controller if he still had contact with N41EH, and suggesting that if he did that he turn N41EH to the east or the northwest because the weather was pretty bad for the next  10 miles. Starting at 0923:22 FAA controllers made several attempts to communicate with the occupants of N41EH, but with negative results. Radar data obtained from the FAA, showed that at 0921:17 the N41EH was indicating an altitude of 7,000 feet, and the last radar indication at 0922:29 showed N41EH to be at an altitude of 4600 feet. At 1114, the crew of the U.S. Navy P-3 which the Coast Guard had diverted in response to notification from the FAA of a possible downed airplane, located debris at latitude 30 degrees, 46.1 minutes north, longitude 081 degrees, 17.04 minutes west.

The helicopter approached the construction site in an out-of-ground-effect hover taxi, with a quartering left tailwind.  The helicopter turned to the right, and slowed to a stationary hover about 250 feet above the ground with a direct tailwind.  Once in a hover, the helicopter made a right, rapid 180-degree pedal turn around the mast, stopped momentarily, then initiated another rapid pedal turn to the right.  The helicopter turned at a faster rate than the initial turn, and continued into a spinning, vertical descent to the ground.  Examination of the helicopter revealed no mechanical anomalies.  The collective was in the full up position, and the main rotor blades exhibited signatures consistent with low rotor rpm at ground contact.  A review of the pilot's company flight records revealed he had 531 hours of total flight experience, 60 hours of which were in airplanes.  The pilot had 87 hours of experience in make and model.  A relative wind chart published by the manufacturer depicts a helicopter facing 360 degrees over a compass rose.  One shaded area of the chart depicts winds from between 120 degrees and 240 degrees, at wind speeds above 5 knots and up to 17 knots.  According to a note on the chart an unanticipated right yaw may occur when operating in the shaded areas of the chart.  According to FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 90-95, ""Any maneuver which requires the pilot to operate in a high power, low airspeed environment with a left crosswind or tailwind creates an environment where unanticipated right yaw may occur.""  The AC also advised of greater susceptibility for loss of tailrotor effectiveness in right turns and the phenomena may occur in varying degrees in all single main rotor helicopters at airspeeds less than 30 knots.","The pilot's improper decision to maneuver in an environment conducive to a loss of tail rotor effectiveness, and his inadequate recovery from the resultant unanticipated right yaw."

The airplane  was on final approach to land at Hilton Head Airport, when according to witnesses, it suddenly rolled to the right, and descended, initially impacting trees at about the 70-foot level, and then impacting the ground. A fire then ensued upon ground impact, and the debris field spanned about 370 feet along an azimuth of about 082 degrees. Examination of the airplane wreckage revealed that left wing flap actuator and jack nut measurements were consistent with the wing flaps being extended to 40 degrees, and on the right wing the flap jack nut and actuator measurements were consistent with the right flap being extended to about a 20-degrees. In addition, the right flap torque tube assembly between the flap motor and the flap stop assembly had disconnected, and the flap torque tube assembly's female coupler which attaches to the male spline end of the flap motor and flap stop assembly was found with a cotter pin installed through the female coupler of the flap stop assembly. The cotter pin, had not been placed through the spline and the coupler consistent with normal installation as per Mitsubishi's maintenance manual, or as specified in Airworthiness Directive 88-23-01. Instead, the cotter pin had missed the male spline on the flap motor. In addition, the flap coupler on the opposite side of the flap motor was found to also found to not have a cotter pin installed. Company maintenance records showed that on April 3, 2001, about 87 flight hours before the accident, the airplane was inspected per Airworthiness Directive (AD) 88-23-01, which required the disassembly, inspection, and reassembly of the flap torque tube joints. In addition, on July 9, 2001, the airplane was given a phase 1 inspection, and Bankair records showed that a company authorized maintenance person performed the applicable maintenance items, and certified the airplane for return to service.","Improper maintenance/installation and and inadequate inspection of the airplane's flap torque tube joints during routine maintenance by company maintenance personnel, which resulted in the right flap torque tube assembly coupler becoming detached and the flaps developing asymmetrical lift  when extended, which resulted in an uncontrolled roll,  a descent, and an impact with a tree during approach to land."

The floatplane sustained substantial damage on impact with water during takeoff.  The pilot reported that he sustained no injury.  He reported that one of his passengers was uninjured and the other passenger sustained serious injuries.  The pilot reported, ""After refueling we taxied to east end of lake ...  West wind at est. 12 knots. Prior to takeoff checklist completed controls tested free and correct.  After aircraft on step and flying speed attained (60 kts) the right float was raised and slight back pressure we were airborne.  On attempting to move control wheel to the right to level the a/c, the control wheel was jammed.  I immediately suspected that the rf seat passengers knee was beneath the right side of the control wheel preventing return to neutral position.  I shouted to him to move his knee but the control wheel remained jammed.  The a/c continued in a left bank reaching est. altitude of 30 to 50 feet above the water.  The left bank increased and we began  to loose altitude despite full power.  The aircraft impacted the water in approx. a 40 [degree] bank (lt) and 45 [degree] nose down attitude.  We completed approx. 180 [degree] turn from our takeoff heading.  ... After liftoff this happened very quickly.  Probably in less than 10 or 15 seconds.""  The passenger stated, ""I heard the pilot say '[the passenger's name], your knee' twice.  I immediately looked down at my left knee and witnessed the left side of the control wheel situated against the inner aspect of the knee, but not appearing obstructed from movement.  It never occurred to me to look at the right knee.  ... I honestly do not know what precisely caused the accident.  I never asked the pilot if he witnessed my knee blocking the control wheel.  ... The absence of any bruising or abrasion on or about the knee/upper leg makes me suspect my knees weren't the cause as well.""  The recorded wind was 200 degrees at 5 knots.  FAA examination of the wreckage revealed no pre-impact anomalies.",The inadvertant control interference by the passenger's knee leading to the pilot's directional control of the  floatplane not being possible.

The airplane traveled off the departure end of the runway and into a sand/gravel pit on landing.  The landing was being made on runway 35 (3,500 feet by 140 feet, dry grass).   A typed statement provided by the pilot with his NTSB form 6120.1/2 stated that because of trees at the end of the runway, the pilot made a higher than normal approach and sustained engine power until the trees were cleared.  He reported the airplane touched down 500 feet beyond approach end of the runway.  The pilot reported that during the landing roll he applied additional braking when he realized that the runway had a down slope.  He reported, ""While I am sure there was a moment that I could have aborted the landing, it passed due to my confidence that directional control and braking was sufficient to achieve this landing.""  The airplane continued off the departure end of the runway into a sand/gravel pit, which is 8 to 10 feet below the runway elevation.  The right wing contacted a sand pile and the airplane rotated 20 degrees to the right prior to coming to rest.  There are 60-foot tall trees located 10 feet from the approach end of runway 35.

According to ground witnesses at the airport, the pilot departed uphill on runway 36 into rising terrain, and collided with trees just beyond the runway's departure end.  Runway 36 is 2,980 feet in length with a 50-foot pavement width, and has a 3.5 percent uphill gradient  with steeper rising terrain to the north of the airport.  An airport warning sign states in red ""This R/W Closed for takeoff use R/W 18.""  On the day of the accident, the pilot contacted the FAA Rancho Murieta Automated Flight Service Station at 0823.  The pilot questioned the briefer about the takeoff procedure and an ""X"" that was marked on the runway.   A discussion ensued, and the briefer told the pilot to takeoff on runway 36 (uphill), contrary to the intent of signage at the airport and FAA Airport/Facility Directory remarks.  According to the briefer, his source of information for questions relating to airport procedures and operations came from the FAA Airport/Facility Directory.  The entry for the airport in the FAA Airport/Facility Directory was examined.  The first portion of the entry stated:  ""Airport closed to touch and go; go arounds; takeoff from runway 36 and landings on runway 18.""  Toward the end of the entry following some intervening information another note stated:  ""Land runway 36 takeoff runway 18 due to steep 3.5 percent uphill airport gradient and steeper rising terrain to the north.""  The maximum gross weight of the airplane is 3,850 pounds.  Based on known and estimated weights, the weight of the airplane at the time of the accident was about 3,939.0 pounds, or 89 pounds above the maximum takeoff weight.  According to the POH and best available information, the airplane would have required 3,750 feet of level, paved, and dry runway surface for takeoff with zero flaps to clear a 50-foot obstacle at the end.  Witnesses at the airport estimated that the temperatures were in the mid 90's to over 100 degrees, and the wind was out of the south.  Based on information provided by the witnesses, the density altitude was estimated between 4,000 and 4,800 feet mean sea level (msl).","the pilot's selection of the wrong runway, which resulted in an attempted takeoff uphill in a prevailing tailwind toward rising terrain and high obstacles.  Also causal was the pilot's loading of the airplane above maximum gross weight and his failure to properly interpret the aircraft performance charts, which showed the airplane required more runway and distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle than existed for the ambient conditions.  Factors in the accident were the high density altitude and the confusing and contradictory information in the Airport Facility Directory."

The airplane experienced a loss of engine power in the aft engine and collided with a guardrail during an off-airport emergency landing on a highway.  The pilot flew the airplane earlier that afternoon with no mechanical discrepancies noted.  After takeoff and leveling off at 4,500 feet, the pilot thought he noticed a loss of engine power in both engines because he was unable to maintain altitude.  A forced landing was performed on a highway and the airplane went through a guardrail.  A post accident examination revealed the primers were left unlocked with the aft engine primer pulled out approximately 1 inch.  Black sooty deposits were discovered on the rear engine spark plugs.  The primer is as an optional feature to assist in cold weather operations.","The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection of the primer controls, resulting in excessive fuel flow, spark plug fouling, and loss of engine power in the aft engine."

The private certificated pilot was on a personal sightseeing flight in a rental airplane.  The pilot had limited experience in the airplane that was equipped with an intergrated flight/nav/autopilot system.  During cruise flight, the airplane suddenly pitched upward. The pilot pushed forward on the control yoke, and noticed the trim wheel moving in a nose up direction.  She used the manual trim wheel to trim the airplane nose down, but the airplane still pitched upward. The pilot began to exert forward pressure on the control yoke to keep the airplane from climbing, and asked her front seat passenger to help push forward on the control yoke.  The pilot made a ""mayday"" call and decided to make an emergency landing at a 2,200 feet gravel surface airport.  The pilot said she turned onto about a one mile final approach, but said she was either going too fast, or the runway was too short.  The airplane touched down about mid-length on the runway and bounced several times.  The pilot saw the end of the runway approaching, and added full throttle to begin a go-around.  The airplane collided with trees at the departure end the runway.  The pilot said she did not know if the autopilot was on or off, but she did not consciously select or use the autopilot, and did not even know if the airplane was equipped with electric trim.  The pilot said she remembered seeing 7000 displayed in a box located above the transponder (the autopilot computer).  The pilot said she used the radio transmit button on the left side of the pilot's control yoke, but did not use any other switches on the yoke.  The pilot said her front seat passenger is not a pilot, and did not touch any items on the control panel.  The autopilot was installed on the right side of the instrument panel.  The pilot did not receive any instruction from the operator, or from her flight instructor about the autopilot system, and the pilot did not familiarize herself with the autopilot system.  The pilot's flight instructor reported that during a previous training flight with another student, he discovered the autopilot system was on, even though he did not turn it on.  Postaccident testing of the autopilot system did not reveal any malfunction.","The pilot's inadequate remedial action to disconnect the autopilot during an uncommanded altitude deviation while in cruise flight.  Factors in the accident were activation of the autopilot; the pilot's lack of familiarity with the airplane's autopilot system; her failure to attain the proper touchdown point during an emergency landing, and delayed go-around resulting in an overrun and collision with trees; the operator's insufficient training standards for the airplane, and the pilot's flight instructor's failure to provide adequate upgrade/transition training in the airplane."

The airplane sustained substantial damage during a forced landing to a soybean field after a complete loss of engine power.  The pilot reported he was flying in cruise flight at 2,800 feet mean sea level.  The airplane was operating normally with no abnormal engine indications.  He reported that he heard a ""loud bang"" and experienced a complete loss of engine power.  He attempted to restart the engine but with no success.  He declared an emergency and executed a forced landing to a soybean field.  The on-site inspection of the airplane revealed that the number 3 cylinder and connecting rod had separated from the engine.  The examination of the engine revealed that all eight hold down studs on the number 3 cylinder deck were broken and exhibited fatigue fractures.  The metallurgical examination of the upper front and lower front 1/2 inch thru-studs revealed they had fractured through approximately 95% and 90%, respectively, of their cross-sections by fatigue as characterized by the smooth transgranular topography and beach marks.  The hardness of the studs was below the engineering drawing requirements.  The examination of the thru-studs indicated that the studs were not properly heat-treated.  The 3/8 inch cylinder stud fractures were secondary to the anchored thru-stud fatigue fractures.  The hardness of the other thru-studs in the crankcase was also below the requirements outlined in engineering drawings.  The maintenance records revealed that the engine had been overhauled at an engine overhaul facility on February 11, 1999.  It had accumulated about 532 hours of flight time since the last major overhaul.  The engine overhaul facility did not, and was not required by the Federal Aviation Administration regulations or the engine manufacturer's overhaul manual, to test the engine thru-studs for hardness during the engine overhaul.","The total loss of engine power during cruise flight due to the number 3 cylinder thru-studs fatigue fractures, and the thru-stud's low hardness as a result improper heat treatment of the thru-studs, and the unsuitable terrain encountered during the forced landing."

The airline transport certificated pilot intended to fly to a remote river, but the intended route of flight was obscured by clouds over nearby mountain tops.  The pilot said he decided to land toward the north on a gravel bar along the river.  The landing area was about 800 feet long, and 100 feet wide.  The pilot said he made three low passes over the gravel bar, and then began the landing approach.  He said he applied engine carburetor heat when he was abeam the landing threshold.  As the airplane descended toward the ground, the pilot noticed the gravel bar contained larger rocks than he liked. He began a go-around about 30 feet above the ground by applying full engine power.  The pilot said the engine sputtered and the airplane settled onto the gravel.  As the airplane touched down, the engine returned to full power.  The airplane lifted off, but collided with willow bushes and nosed over.

Prior to landing the helicopter at an altitude of about 12,000 feet mean sea level, the pilot completed a ""power check,"" and at that time, the engine was able to develop 39 inches of manifold pressure.  While on short final, the pilot added power, however, the engine could only achieve 31 inches of manifold pressure.  The pilot then executed a forced landing to a grassy area at the top of a slope.  Approximately 10 feet agl, the low rotor rpm horn sounded, and the pilot ""cushioned the landing with little power.""  Subsequently, the helicopter slid off the slope, rolled over, and came to rest on its right side.  The helicopter was recovered and examined by a helicopter mechanic and the pilot.  During the examination, the mechanic found that ""the wastegate linkage sheath was in its detent.""  However, ""the sheath took two fingers with very light pressure to pull it out of its detent.""  The mechanic attributed the ease with which he was able to pull the sheath out of the detent to ""the ball plunger on the wastegate linkage not being torqued.""  In the mechanic's opinion, ""between the light torque on the ball plunger and the heat in the engine compartment, the sheath for the wastegate linkage would at times slide on the inside shaft.  Without collective, throttle, and wastegate rigging working together, this would greatly affect power or lack of power.""",the partial loss of engine power due to the slippage of the wastegate linkage as a result of the plunger on the linkage being undertorqued by an unknown person.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

The pilot was performing a high-speed taxi run when the airplane began to lift off the ground, and he decided to take-off.  About 300-400 feet above the ground, the engine lost partial power, and the pilot made a forced landing on airport property.   The engine was test-run on the airframe utilizing the airplane's own fuel system, but it would not start.  Examination of the fuel system revealed that the carburetor fuel port and screen were blocked with debris.  The debris was removed and the screen was placed back on the carburetor.  The engine started immediately, and ran continuously at various power settings without interruption.  The debris was identified as small pieces of leaves, various pieces of colored material, and an insect cocoon.  A 100-hour inspection was performed on the airplane about 37 days before the accident and an overhauled engine was installed.  The logbooks also indicated that a new tachometer was installed at a time of 000.1, all fluid carrying hoses and scat hoses were replaced, and the fuel system was flushed.  Eighteen days before the accident an annual inspection was performed on the engine and airplane at a tachometer time of 000.1.  At the time of the accident, the tachometer read 0001.9.

The purpose of the helicopter flight was to give the private pilot a practical flight evaluation for a commercial pilot certificate.  While in cruise flight, the FAA designated pilot examiner (DPE) initiated a simulated engine failure to the pilot.  Neither pilot monitored the engine RPM, and neither noticed that the engine stopped producing power after the DPE reduced the throttle.  As a result, the rotor RPM decayed during the attempted powered recovery, the glide distance was reduced, and adequate rotor RPM for cushion at touchdown was not available.  The pilot was asked if there were any specific checks or callouts he was to perform in the event of a simulated engine failure.  He said that he did not have any required callouts, did not verbalize his intended point of touchdown, or crosscheck the engine RPM until he attempted a powered recovery from the autorotation.  The examiner was asked if the applicant was required to check any parameters or make any callouts during his response to the simulated emergency.  Specifically, he was asked if the applicant had to confirm the engine idle rpm, and he said no.  After the accident, the engine started and ran continuously without interruption.",The pilot's failure to maintain rotor rpm during the simulated forced landing.  Also causal in the accident was the failure of both pilots to recognize the total loss of engine power and the CFI's inadequate remedial actions.  A factor in the accident was the loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.

The certified flight instructor flew into Fort Lauderdale to go to a pilot shop.  After doing so, a limited preflight, and an engine run-up before takeoff were performed; no discrepancies noted.  An intersection takeoff was performed and when no usable runway remained for landing, the landing gear was retracted.  The left seat pilot turned off the auxiliary fuel pump and the engine experienced the initial loss of power.  The CFI took control of the airplane and visually verified the positions of the magneto switch, master switch, and fuel pump.  The fuel pump was turned on, and the throttle, mixture, and propeller controls were pushed forward; the manifold pressure indicated 17 or 18 inHg.  The throttle was pumped, and the mixture control was leaned, with no effect.  The CFI later reported that he felt, ""minimal resistance"", when pumping the throttle.  He advised the tower of the loss of engine power and maneuvered the airplane gear-up for a forced landing on a roadway.  He noted that the manifold pressure was indicating 15 inHg, and he reduced throttle before landing on the road later reporting, ""Nothing changed.""  The airplane lightly contacted soft material on the roof of a car; no structural damage to the car was noted.  A full stall landing was performed and while sliding on the ground, the right wingtip collided with the rear bumper of a bus; no structural damage to the bus was noted.  Examination of the airplane revealed the throttle lever with attached throttle cable was separated from the carburetor; no evidence of safety wire was present in the hole of the securing screw of the throttle lever, on the lever, or on the throttle stop.  Using the airplanes fuel system, the engine was started and operated; no discrepancies were noted.  Airworthiness directive 72-06-05 Revision 2, with an effective date of July 3, 1986, indicates in part to safety wire the throttle arm and clamping screw to the throttle stop; it was signed off as being accomplished on January 10, 2000.  The method of compliance was listed as, ""[complied with] at [overhaul].""  The carburetor was signed off as being overhauled on February 21, 2000.  Calculations indicate that the propeller rpm at touchdown was 1,566.",The failure of the mechanic who installed the carburetor after overhaul to safety the throttle linkage at the carburetor per an Airworthiness Directive resulting in separation of the throttle linkage and subsequent partial loss of engine power.  Contributing to the accident was the unsuitable terrain encountered by the pilot-in-command during the forced landing.

According to the pilot, the flight was planned as a commercial sight-seeing flight in the Key West vicinity. The customers were an elderly Hispanic couple who spoke little English. Upon reaching cruising altitude, the male passenger left his seat,  encroached into the cockpit,  produced a knife, turned the radios and transponder off, and demanded to be flown to Cuba. In an attempt to thwart the hijacking, the pilot pitched over to produce negative ""g"" to disable the hijacker, and headed back to Key West. In the ensuing struggle, the hijacker fell against and bent the retarded throttle. Attempts to straighten the throttle shaft snapped it off, and an idle power ditching was conducted. At water impact, forward motion stopped  violently, and the lap-belted passengers appeared to lose consciousness. The pilot egressed from the right cockpit door, inflated his life vest, and swam to the passenger door to extricate the passengers, but the aircraft started sinking before he could get the door open. The passengers went down with the aircraft, and the pilot was rescued by a U. S. Navy helicopter.

The airplane bounced hard during landing.  The CFI reported that during the approach he noticed that the student ""was not in position to safely land a/c"" and he repeatedly ""ordered"" the student to relinquish the flight controls, but the student did not.  He reported that the result was a hard landing.  The student pilot reported that he and the CFI were wearing noise reduction ear plugs.  He stated that both he and the CFI were on the flight controls during the flight and the landing.  The student stated that no commands were given during the landing.  The back seat passenger was also a pilot.  He reported that both the CFI and the student had their hands on the flight controls during the landing.  He reported the airplane hit hard on the runway, bounced 15 feet in the air, then came down hard on the nose gear, striking the propeller on the runway.  He reported the airplane oscillated several more times and the student pushed the throttle forward as if to go around.  He reported he shouted from the backseat ""shut it down - we're finished.""  The power was reduced to idle and the airplane was stopped on the runway.  The back seat passenger's perception of the student pilot was that he seemed ""overly confident and aggressive with regard to his piloting abilities.""

The helicopter was being used to support seismic operations in the area and had just dropped off several bags of equipment.  The pilot made a right pedal turn to move away from a steep hillside at an altitude of 200 feet agl and an airspeed of 20 to 30 knots.  The engine lost power, and the helicopter began descending.  The pilot initiated an autorotation.  The helicopter landed hard on the right rear skid, which collapsed dropping the helicopter onto its right side.  Examination revealed a total of 2 quarts of fuel in the fuel cells.  No water or contaminants were detected in the fuel.  One ounce of fuel was drained from the engine fuel filter, and 3 ounces of fuel were drained from the engine-driven fuel pump filter bowl.  No fuel was found in the engine supply line.","fuel exhaustion due to the pilot's failure to refuel the aircraft, which resulted in a loss of engine power.

The commercial pilot was completing the third leg of a soaring 300 km triangle.   The glider owner, who was in contact with the pilot via radio, reported that the pilot stated he had the field in sight approximately 8 miles from the airport.  The glider entered the traffic pattern for runway 15 and was turning base when the owner observed it enter a spin.  A witness reported that the glider banked, ""appeared to have stalled, and spiraled counter-clockwise"" in a nose low attitude into the ground.  Another witness, located approximately a block from the accident site, stated that she ""looked up and saw the glider spinning counter clockwise very fast and falling nose first.""  The glider impacted the ground and came to rest approximately 1/4 mile from the approach end of runway.  The pilot had accumulated approximately 270 total glider flight hours and 5 flight hours in the same make and model as the accident aircraft.

The airplane collided with power lines and poles 1.1 miles east of the airport's runway 27 approach end while on a night visual landing approach.  The accident site is in level desert terrain approximately the same elevation as the airport.  Impact marks and transfers disclosed that the aircraft contacted a steel and concrete power pole and associated static and transmission lines with the left wing, center windshield post, and vertical stabilizer.  Investigation revealed that the pilot and passenger had consumed alcoholic beverages during dinner together at a local restaurant the night of the accident.  Following dinner, the pair were observed to consume other alcoholic beverages at a party.  The airplane then departed from the airport, where the airplane is based, at an unknown time for a presumed local flight.  An airborne witness was piloting an emergency medical services helicopter (based at the airport), which was returning from a mission and inbound to the airport from the south.  He observed the position lights of the accident airplane approach the airport from the west through a pass, which crosses the mountains between the valley where the airport is located and the greater Las Vegas metropolitan area.  The position lights were roughly at the same elevation as his helicopter, 4,000 feet msl.  He attempted to contact the airplane on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency, but got no response.  As he continued inbound to the airport, he monitored the position of the airplane and saw it on a wide arcing flight path to the south of the airport.  As he was beginning a final descent to land at their parking spot, the airplane's pilot came on the CTAF and announced that he was going to make a ""teardrop approach"" to runway 27 left.  The witness said the pilot's voice had an unusual and strange quality and that the comment about a teardrop approach confused him momentarily because he knew that there was no such instrument approach to the airport.  He then observed the airplane continue the wide arcing and descending left-hand flight path to runway 27.  The witness had landed and was shutting the helicopter down when he looked up and observed the navigation lights of the airplane on final approach.  He thought to himself that the airplane was very low, then he saw the bright flash of arcing electricity as the airplane contacted the power lines.  The power lines contacted by the airplane are the most eastern of four sets of high tension power lines running perpendicular to the approach end of the runway.  The pole and lines contacted by the airplane were 66 feet above ground level and on the extended runway centerline.  The most western set of the three power line sets were marked by red obstruction lights.  The sky was clear and the winds calm, with no moon visible.  The airport's runway and approach lights were functioning.  The airport is located on the south side of the city and, for an airplane on final approach, the airport lights would be the only ground reference lights visible.  No pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or failures were identified with the airplane or engine.   Ethanol was found in the following levels in specimens from the pilot: 124 mg/dl in blood, 74 mg/dl in brain, and 214 mg/dl in urine.",the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate terrain and obstruction clearance altitude while maneuvering in a non-standard visual approach to land.  The pilot's misjudgment of his altitude and distance from the airport was due to impairment by alcohol.  Factors in the accident were the dark nighttime lighting conditions and the visual perception difficulty created by a lack of ground reference lights.

The operator stated that their mission was to drop smoke jumpers on the Dusenbury fire incident in the South Warner Wilderness area of the Modoc National Forest.  The air was smooth as the airplane descended over the fire.  The 9 smoke jumpers were let out over the fire at 8,500 feet mean sea level (msl) in five passes, followed by four more passes to drop cargo.  When the jump operations were completed, 360-degree circuits were made to gain altitude for the flight back to Redding.  The ""fasten seatbelt"" sign was turned off for jump operations and cabin securing.  There were two cabin crewmembers (spotters) on board who were securing the cabin for their return flight to Redding.  As the airplane crossed over a ridge line at 9,000 feet msl (800 feet above ground level), it encountered a sudden wind shear, or downdraft, but then immediately back into smooth air.  One spotter hit his helmet on the ceiling, but was not injured.  The second spotter, who was in mid-cabin reported, ""I just broke my leg.""  The pilot diverted the flight to Alturas.  No other turbulence was encountered prior to or after the accident event.  Following the accident, the pilot filed a ""Safecon Aviation Safety Communique"" through the U.S. Forest Service aviation management website.  Additionally, the pilot made the following recommendations to prevent future accidents of this nature:  1) Re-emphasize to flight crews the importance of cabin safety awareness.  2) Re-emphasize to flight crews the potential for hidden turbulence over mountainous terrain.  3) Emphasize the importance of remaining in stable air while cabin personnel are securing cargo and moving about the cabin at the completion of drop missions.  4) Ensure all personnel aboard the aircraft are seated with seatbelts fastened whenever turbulence is anticipated.",The inadvertent encounter with terrain induced turbulence.  A factor was the high terrain.

Before taxiing, the pilot advised the controller that he had Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) ""Whiskey"" which at that time indicated in part that the wind was variable at 7 knots.  The pilot was cleared to taxi to runway 09, then was cleared to takeoff and remain in right traffic.  The flight turned downwind, base, and final where during final approach with 30 degrees of flaps extended,  the pilot later reported that he did not flare enough and the airplane bounced up ""slightly.""  The airplane porpoised two times and he later learned that the propeller contacted the left runway edge.  He attempted to takeoff again before the airplane departed the runway; this was unsuccessful.  The airplane departed the left side of the runway, collided with a taxiway light, and rolled onto grass between the runway and taxiway E.  The nose landing gear collided with a berm causing the nose landing gear to collapse; the airplane then nosed over.  The pilot further stated that he lost consciousness when the flight contacted the berm and regained consciousness while inverted; both occupants exited the airplane through the passenger door.  A METAR issued at 1153 local, indicates in part that the wind was from 170 degrees at 7 knots.  Review of FAA Order 7110.65N, titled ""Air Traffic Control"" indicates, ""ASOS/AWOS is to be considered the primary source of wind direction, velocity, and altimeter data for weather observation purposes...""  The pilot received his high-performance signoff before the accident flight; the flight training for the signoff consisted of 5 hours.","The delay of the pilot to perform a go-around following a bounced landing and porpoise, and failure of the pilot to maintain directional control resulting in the airplane departing the runway and colliding with a berm."

At the completion of a night, cross-country flight, the pilot attempted to land at his home airpark under dark night conditions.  The rotating beacon was operating, and per the NOTAM in effect, the runway and taxiway lights were inoperative.  The pilot made an approach, then went around because he could not see the runway ""soon enough.""  The pilot made another approach, and again attempted to go around.  Shortly after commencing the go-around attempt, the airplane impacted the ground about 300 feet to the right of, and 700 feet from the approach end of the runway.  The impact point was also 50 feet to the right of the parallel taxiway.  There were no mechanical malfunctions noted.",The pilot's delayed go-around during the landing attempt.

After conducting a satisfactory pre-takeoff run-up check of both the right magneto and left coil ignition system, the pilot departed for his destination.  Approximately 30 minutes into the flight the engine began to run rough and the pilot determined that the right magneto was not operating.  He then selected the left ignition and, although the engine initially continued to run roughly, eventually all power was lost.  The pilot selected an open field used by a farmer to operate his Cessna 177 in and out of due to the non-availability of any other adequate landing site.  As he maneuvered through a 180 degree turn toward the landing area, he noted a 1,000-foot/minute rate of descent, which was greater than he had anticipated.   The landing gear had been extended and as the aircraft was maneuvered onto a short final, the right main landing gear struck a cow.  The aircraft yawed into a left skid, contacted the ground and skidded through a barbwire fence.  Post-crash examination revealed that the right magneto had grounded internally resulting in its failure to operate.  Additional testing revealed the left coil ignition system had also grounded internally as evidence by arcing, and it too, had failed.","An internal ground in the right magneto followed by an internal ground evidenced by arcing in the left ignition coil unit, which led to failure of both the right magneto and the left coil ignition system respectively during cruise.  Contributing factors were a cow impacted by the right main landing gear and the pilot's unanticipated higher than expected rate of descent during the 180 degree descending turn to final."

The certificated private pilot, with one passenger, was departing southbound from an airport under special VFR conditions.  Witnesses reported that weather conditions to the south, and specifically in the direction of accident site, were momentarily much worse than that being reported at the airport.  About two minutes after takeoff, the airplane collided with a 335 feet tall commerical radio antenna tower.  The tower was situated about 395 feet above sea level, and located 4.3 nautical miles south of the departure airport.  The tower was installed in 1986, and was depicted as an obstruction on the VFR aviation sectional map covering the area around the departure airport.  The tower was painted in an alternating aviation orange/aviation white pattern.  Two sets of red light fixtures were installed about the 110 and 220 feet levels.  Each set of lights had two lamps.  A large flashing red light fixture was installed at the top of the tower.  One of the two light fixture lamps, located on the lower portion of the tower, was not operating, and was scheduled for replacement.  However, the second light fixture lamp located at that this position was still operating.  A light sensitive switch (photocell), was installed that would automatically turn the tower lights ""ON"" when the surrounding ambient light decreased, and would turn the tower lights ""OFF"" when ambient light increased.  At the time of the accident, the lights were configured so that they were in the ""ON"" position 24 hours per day.  The accident took place during daylight hours.  The antenna complied with the governing FCC's rules and regulations regarding marking and lighting of antennas, as well as the FAA's obstruction standards.","The pilot's failure to maintain adequate clearance from an obstruction (antenna tower), and his continued flight into instrument meteorological conditions.

The air taxi scheduled commuter pilot had six passengers and some cargo aboard.  He attempted to takeoff from a 1,625 long gravel airstrip with nearly a direct tailwind of approximately 10 knots.  Witnesses related that the airplane lifted off the runway twice, settled onto the runway, and eventually went off the end of the runway, coming to rest about 1,300 feet from the departure end.  All witnesses, and the pilot, reported that the engine appeared to be operating normally and was at a high power setting.  An Alaska State Trooper pilot landed shortly after the accident and spoke with the pilot and witnesses, including another air taxi pilot.  The witnesses all said the accident pilot took off downwind.  When the Trooper interviewed the pilot, he asked him how he determined the direction of the wind prior to takeoff.  The Trooper said the pilot told him he looked at the windsock while on the ramp.  The Trooper noted that the interview took place on the ramp, and the windsock was not visible from there due to high vegetation.","The pilot's selection of a the wrong runway, which resulted in a tailwind for the takeoff attempt.

The pilot experienced a catastrophic engine failure while in cruise flight and performed a forced landing to an airport.  Examination of the engine revealed a three inch hole in the engine case, adjacent to the number 2 cylinder.  The airplane had been operated for about 4 hours since the number 1 and 2 cylinder and piston assemblies were replaced by a maintenance facility in Knoxville, Tennessee.  A teardown of the engine revealed a separated number 2 connecting rod and significant damage to the number 2 piston and cylinder.  Examination revealed heavy longitudinal scoring and metal transfer on the number 2 cylinder bore and the inboard edge of the barrel was deformed consistent with connecting rod contact.  The inboard end of the number 2 connecting rod was fractured in two locations adjacent to the rod bearing area, and the surrounding area was discolored consistent with extreme localized heating.  The connecting rod bolt fragment showed tensile elongation along with surface and fracture features consistent with an elevated temperature overstress separation.  The crowns of both pistons indicated that they were manufactured by Superior Air Parts and were 0.010 inch oversize (P010) in diameter; however, diameter measurements made on each piston at various datum points revealed that the number 2 piston was closer in size to a standard size piston and did not contained any measurable dimensions within the P010 limits.  Overall, the number 1 piston measurements tended to be closer to the P010 dimensions, and contained two locations that were in the P010 limits.  Hardness measurements taken from both pistons were below the specified range for a new piston.  The cylinder assemblies were supplied by an aviation facility in El Reno, Oklahoma, which used ""serviceable parts.""  The specific service history of the pistons and piston pins could not be determined.  The owner of aviation facility stated that they did not check the ""piston skirt clearance"" and expected the installer to check the skirt clearance per the Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) Overhaul Manual, at the time of the installation.  According to maintenance facility in Tennessee, the cylinders were installed per the TCM Overhaul Manual.","Improper maintenance which resulted in the installation of an unserviceable piston assembly, and the subsequent catastrophic engine failure.  Factors in this accident were the improper inspection by the piston supplier and the softening of the piston."

The flight instructor and student pilot were returning from a cross country flight, when a witness on the ground heard the airplane's engine ""just cut-out"".  The witness looked up and saw the airplane ""flying as it should."" He said the airplane then ""turned into a nose-dive"" and started to spin toward the ground.  As the airplane descended, the witness said it appeared as if the pilot was fighting the airplane.  He also heard the engine trying to be re-started.  The witness said the airplane ""stayed in a consistent spiral"" with a ""really wide axis"" until it disappeared into the trees.  Additionally, he said the airplane took a long time to descend to the ground, and that the pilot had plenty of time to recover.  The last nine seconds of recorded radar data indicated that the airplane had descended from 5,000 feet to 4,300 feet.  The distance between the last radar return and the location of the accident site was approximately 765 feet.  Three of the flight instructor's students reported that the flight instructor had asked them if they wanted to learn spins during their flight lessons.  According to two students, the flight instructor would enter the spin from a power on stall, and recover after two to three rotations.  However, on one occasion, a student said the flight instructor, ""did a whole lot of rotations...way more than three.  I estimated that we did about 10 rotations, but I am not exactly sure...The spiral was tight...The more we let it spin, the tighter the rotations.  However, he had no problem recovering the airplane.""  The flight instructor had accrued a total of about 1,485.7 flight hours, of which 234.4 hours were in make and model, and 1,051.6 total hours were as flight instructor.  Review of Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 61.107- Flight Proficiency, an applicant for a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land is not required to receive and log spin training from an authorized instructor.

A staff pilot for the manufacturer was providing a sales demonstration flight to a potential customer's pilot when yaw control of the helicopter was lost, it entered a spin, collided with the ground, and rolled over.  During the flight the customer's typical aerial application pest control flight profile was to be flown.  The customer pilot flew Bell 206's currently in the mission and had no experience in the NOTAR anti-torque system.  The maneuver was a simulated aerial application pass followed by a turn around.  The manufacturer's pilot said the maneuver was very docile and consisted of a pass down a creek bed at 60 knots and 50 feet.  The customer pilot initiated a gentle cyclic pull-up to a 10- to 15-degree nose up attitude while entering a right turn as the helicopter decelerated.  At the 90 degree point in the turn, the helicopter was at 40 to 50 knots with a 30-degree or less bank angle to the right.  As the nose came around in the turn, the nose tucked down to about 20 degrees below the horizon.  The manufacturer's pilot took over the controls and added near full aft cyclic to level the nose; at this point, he received a low rotor warning horn (indicating a rotor droop at 95 percent or lower).  Coincident with the low rotor warning, the helicopter began a right yaw rate.  He added full left pedal, but the yaw rate continued at what he described as a ""slow pedal turn rate,"" eventually completing 4 to 6 complete revolutions.  At this point the helicopter began descending and he added collective.  He immediately got a ""power"" audio warning, indicating that he was exceeding the upper power limit of the engine.  The right yaw rate also increased with collective input.  The pilot then modulated the collective between the low rotor warning and the excessive power warning in an attempt to both control the yaw and stop the descent.  As he lowered the collective and the rotor speed began to build, the yaw would slow, but the helicopter then began descending faster.  As he added collective to slow the descent, the yaw rate would increase.  As the helicopter neared the ground, the yaw finally stopped; however, the helicopter was translating sideways toward a berm.  The helicopter touched down on the right skid against the berm and it rolled over.  The manufacturer's pilot said his hands were following on the controls as the customer pilot flew and he did not perceive any unusual control inputs.  He further stated that his feet were about 1 inch from the anti-torque pedals and he did not feel any inputs from the customer pilot on the pedals.  Based on his extensive flight test experience in this helicopter, the manufacturer's pilot believes that the aft cyclic input to correct the nose down pitching moment induced a rotor droop, and that the droop was the initiating event in the yaw rate onset.  He does not know how low the rotor speed went, but the warning is triggered at 95 percent Nr.  The lower limit of the Nr green arc is at 90 percent.  The NOTAR anti-torque control system uses air from a pedal controlled jet thruster nozzle on the end of the tail boom to provide anti-torque control.  Additional yaw control is provided by vertical stabilizers, which are largely effective only above 20 to 30 knots.  Air is supplied to the thruster by a fan driven by a power takeoff shaft from the main transmission.  There is a direct relationship between the speed of the main rotor and the speed of the fan.  The pilot said he believes that the initial yaw onset was because the rotor drooped low enough to slow the fan below the speed which could supply the necessary air volume to the thruster to control the yaw and they were not fast enough for the vertical stabilizers to have any effect.  After the occupants had extricated themselves from the wreckage, the customer pilot asked the pilot what had happened.  He replied to them that he didn't know what happened and added, ""Maybe we should have turned to the left instead.""  The helicopter's FAA approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) contains several warnings about low speed maneuvering.  Under the heading ""Unanticipated Right Yaw"", the RFM section notes that an unanticipated right yaw can occur when operating at low altitude and airspeeds below 60 knots when a pilot's attention is distracted by events outside the helicopter and sufficient control inputs are not made to adjust for changing aerodynamic conditions.  The paragraph states, ""If no directional or cyclic control inputs are made, a nose down pitch and a right roll may follow the right yaw.""  The section notes that this is most likely to occur at speeds below 60 knots in uncoordinated right turns, while flying out of trim with too much right pedal, or right turns to a downwind condition.  Examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of a preimpact malfunction or failure of the control system.",the manufacturer's pilot's failure to maintain yaw control and main rotor speed while recovering from an unusual attitude induced by the customer pilot's inadequate control inputs while maneuvering at low altitude.  The manufacturer's pilot's inadequate supervision of the flight is also causal.  A factor in the accident was the customer pilot's lack a familiarity with the NOTAR yaw control system.

The second pilot stated he was attempting to land on the grass runway.  After determining the glider was too high to land on the intended runway, the first pilot took control of the aircraft in an attempt to maneuver the glider to an alternate landing location beyond the departure end of the runway.  However, during the maneuver the glider's left wingtip contacted the ground.  The first pilot reported that it was evident the glider was too high to land on the intended runway, and too low to abort the landing.  He reported that he ""…took the controls"" in an effort to maneuver the glider into a better position for landing.  He reported that he intended to land in an open area between the departure end of the runway 07 and trees located east of the runway.  During the maneuver, the glider's left wingtip contacted the ground, and ""caused the aircraft to do an abrupt yaw to the left.""  Witnesses to the accident reported the glider contacted the terrain in a left wing-low, nose-down attitude approximately 60 feet beyond the departure end of the runway.  For the purpose of this report, the first pilot is defined as the pilot who was manipulating the flight controls at the time of the accident.",Failure to maintain clearance from terrain during a low altitude turn.  The second pilot overshooting the runway was a contributing factor to the accident.

According to the pilot, they were flying up the canyon to gain altitude to clear the mountain passes, and after approximately 10 minutes, had a gain of approximately 3,000 feet in altitude.  There was no indication of an engine problem and the engine ""appeared to be running smoothly, but the plane would not climb"" and the airplane ""mysteriously"" began to lose airspeed to the point of descending 500 feet per minute in level flight.  The airspeed was at 80 knots with ""full power, and full pitch props, and leaned mixture.""  After recognizing the ""flight condition,"" he only had a few minutes to ""control the descent to a crash landing in the aspen trees."" He stated that they did not receive any injuries upon impact; however, they received ""flash burns,"" which he thought, ""originated from fuel vapors from broken fuel lines.""  Witnesses stated that the airplane was flying approximately 100 feet above the trees and was ""climbing with what seemed to be a constant engine speed.""  Just before the airplane disappeared behind a building, the left wing ""drop slightly.""  Moments later, the engine noise stopped and a large black cloud of smoke appear above the trees.  Another witness stated that approximately 20 minutes after calling 911 to report the accident, he observed the pilot and passenger walking down the road.  He immediately assisted them and transported them to an approaching ambulance.  A police officer observed a column of white smoke rising straight up and for nearly 100 feet above the trees.   He stated that the wreckage was ""engulfed in flames and moderately exploding,"" but the surrounding area was unaffected by the post-crash fire that consumed most of the wreckage.

The airplane collided with terrain while on a low level navigation exercise and was almost totally consumed in a postcrash fire.  The pilots were members of the German Air Force (GAF) and the flight was a low level navigation mission as part of an initial air force pilot training course.  The flight syllabus called for the flight to complete the route at 500 feet agl.  Another airplane with two GAF instructors aboard departed immediately after the accident airplane.  The two instructors in the second airplane initially flew north of the standard route and then turned south to intercept it.  They were about 1,500 agl.  As they turned south, they observed the accident airplane proceeding on a southeasterly course.  Both instructors said that they were looking down at the other airplane, and both estimated its altitude was 500 to 700 agl.  Both instructors said the accident airplane was in straight and level flight on a southeasterly heading.  As the airplane crossed the ridge, the airplane went from straight and level to a 30- to 40-degree angle of bank.  The bank angle seemed to increase to 60 degrees and continued to 135 degrees as the nose went down.  It appeared to the pilot in the left seat that the maneuver was abrupt, but he saw nothing to account for it.  He didn't observe any obstacles to avoid, any smoke or flames coming from the airplane prior to impact, and he did not see anything falling from the airplane.  The weather was clear and there was no turbulence.  The airplane came to rest in an upright position.  Vegetation ranging between 3 and 20 feet in height, and within 5 to 30 feet both behind and in front of the wreckage, was scorched but undamaged.  Examination of the wreckage and ground scars disclosed that the airplane impacted the hillside in an attitude level with the slope and with a large vertical energy vector.  Pieces of airframe and debris that came to rest outside of the charred areas were not sooty or discolored.  Control continuity existed from the control surfaces to the thermally destroyed cabin area.  There was no evidence of a catastrophic engine malfunction.",The flying pilot's initiation of an intentional maneuver at an altitude inadequate to maintain terrain clearance.  Low altitude flight was a contributing factor.

The pilot, who had just bought the airplane, reported that after a ""perfect"" three-point landing, the aircraft began a slow drift to the right.  He reported that he applied left rudder pedal to counteract the right drift, with no response.  He stated that he then added more left rudder, still with no response.  The pilot reported that he then applied left brake, but did not get any braking action.  The aircraft subsequently departed the runway at a speed estimated by the pilot at about 35 MPH.  The left main landing gear then hit a hole and the aircraft came to rest, nose down, about 25 feet off the right side of the runway near the runway exit point.  A post-accident inspection disclosed that the left rudder could deflect about 50 to 55 degrees, with maximum right rudder deflection measured at 30 degrees.  Full design rudder travel is 30 degrees in either direction.   With the rudder at 50 to 55 degrees, the rudder pedal rests against the firewall, preventing the left brake from being applied.  The pilot reported that the aircraft received an annual inspection by the previous owner (a certificated airframe and powerplant mechanic) on the date of sale, in July 2001.  Follow-up interviews with the previous owner/mechanic and the accident pilot disclosed that the previous owner/mechanic was aware of an anomaly which prevented braking from being applied with rudder pedal deflected at the time he performed the annual inspection, and that he informed the pilot of this anomaly on the day the sale took place.","The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing.  Factors included:  an incorrectly manufactured or adjusted rudder travel setting, resulting in restricted movement of the left brake; the mechanic's failure to adjust the rudder travel to the correct tolerance; and the pilot's operation of the aircraft with a known equipment deficiency."

The airplane collided with the terrain during an aerial application flight.  The pilot reported he was applying Roundup RT on a flax field which contained kochia weeds which were about 4  feet tall and the flax was about 18 - 20 inches tall.  He reported that this was the second load that he was spaying on this field and he had been dropping flags to mark the spot where he turned on the chemicals.  He reported that he flew in over wires and noticed what he thought was a flag directly in line with the pass.  In addition, the pilot reported, ""I use a Satloc GPS marking system with the light bar attached between the chemical tank and the fuel tank.  If the spray is turned on after being turned off while on the same pass, the GPS light bar will blink indicating that the airplane is on a pass that has already been sprayed.""  The pilot looked at the light bar which was blinking at which time he felt the ""...airplane lurch as the wheels touched either the weeds or the flax crop.  At the same time as the plane lurched, the chemical in the tank sloshed out of the top of the tank and covered the windshield.""  The pilot reported that he kept the nose of the airplane up and the airplane settled into the field.",The pilot failed to maintain clearance with the terrain during the aerial application flight.

The pilot stated he was on a cross-country flight in preparation for a checkride that was scheduled for August 20, 2001.  The first leg from Kissimmee to Brooksville was uneventful.  The flight departed for the second leg and while en route, the cloud base decreased,  resulting in his flying at a lower altitude.  The flight continued and when it  was near the destination,  the weather became increasingly worse.  The flight encountered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and he elected to continue flying in IMC due to a thunderstorm that was behind the airplane.  He then elected to turn to get out of the IMC conditions but momentarily lost control of the airplane.  He recovered from the loss of control and descended to just above the treetops,  then elected to get on top of the cloud layer and climbed into IMC conditions.  He again descended and reversed course to back track.  He was unable to locate landmarks and obtain assistance from air traffic control to his ""Pan"" calls on 121.5.  With a thunderstorm moving from west to east he elected to land in a field and flew downwind, base, and final leg.  He landed the airplane in the field but during the landing roll, the airplane collided with a fence collapsing the nose landing gear.  He secured the airplane and  waited for further assistance.  According to the Operations Manager for the operator, examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane touched down in a first field then rolled approximately 1,000 feet before colliding with the barbed wire fence.  During recovery of the airplane from the field, each fuel tank had 5+ gallons of fuel; the left wing fuel tank had slightly less fuel when recovered.",The poor in-flight planning decision by the student pilot for his failure to turn around to avoid low ceilings resulting in a precautionary landing in a field.

The wreckage was scattered in a fan-shaped pattern over about 200 feet to the northwest.  The engine was embedded into the (very hard) ground about 10 inches in a near-vertical attitude and with the propeller attached.  Examination of the wreckage at an impound facility did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact mechanical failure; however, the flight control cables were severed at several locations and it was not possible to determine if the entire aircraft was present due to extensive fracturing of the composite structure.  There was no fire.",In-flight loss of control for undetermined reasons.

	According to the pilot, the aircraft underwent an annual inspection on August 2, 2001. One of the tasks performed was the removal and replacement of the oil pump impellers, and the throttle linkage must be disconnected to expedite the job. Nine-tenths of a flight hour and seven takeoffs after returning the aircraft to service, the throttle would not respond to the pilot's input while in the landing pattern. The pilot executed a partial power go-around, and the aircraft crashed into trees at the end of the runway. Wreckage examination revealed the throttle cable disconnected at the carburetor, and no drilled bolt, castellated nut or locking cotter pin that forms the throttle cable-to-carburetor connection was found. The pilot mentioned that since the annual inspection, he detected a slight detent in the throttle motion at about 1,100 rpm engine speed, but failed to mention it to the mechanic. The FAA certified IA who signed off the work stated he was 99.9 per cent certain the attaching hardware was correctly installed.","The failure of maintenance personal to properly reconnect the throttle-cable-to carburetor attachment, resulting in a throttle cable disconnection while in the landing pattern, and collision with trees.

The private pilot was flying the single-engine airplane in cruise flight, when the ""aircraft experienced a prop[eller] runaway and loss of oil pressure.""  The engine began to lose power, so the pilot established the aircraft in a glide toward a dirt road.  At 700 feet agl, ""a connecting rod poked through the cowling and oil covered the windshield.""  Due to reduced vision and the unknown condition of the roadway, the pilot elected to make a landing gear retracted landing.  The airplane came to rest upright on the shoulder of the road.  Examination of the engine revealed that there was no oil present in the engine.  The oil filter converter plate gasket was found protruding from around the adapter plate, and a 1/4-inch section of the gasket was missing.  An Airworthiness Directive (AD) was issued that addressed the oil filter converter plate gasket on engines that had been factory overhauled after April 1, 1999.  The AD required the replacement of the oil filter converter plate gasket before further flight on engines with more than 50 hours time since new, time since overhaul, or time since the last replacement of the gasket or converter plate, and thereafter every 50 hours time in service since the last replacement of the gasket.  Non compliance with the AD could result in the protruding or swelling of the converter plate gasket and subsequent loss of engine oil.  The engine had been factory overhauled and shipped from the factory on February 18, 2000.  At the time of the accident, the engine had accumulated 425 hours since the overhaul.  Examination of the engine maintenance records revealed that the AD had not been previously complied with.","the mechanic's failure to perform an airworthiness directive, which resulted in the loss of engine oil through a partially failed oil filter converter plate gasket, and subsequent failure of a connecting rod during cruise flight.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the ensuing forced landing."

The newly certificated private pilot, with one passenger, entered a small valley that he thought would lead into a larger valley.   After entering the valley, the terrain began rising, and the pilot initiated a full power climb.  The valley became too narrow to turn around, the terrain continued to rise, and the airspeed was decreasing.  The pilot was able to make a forced landing uphill, on an area of rough, uneven terrain.  After landing, the pilot and his passenger were eventually able to turn the airplane around, facing downhill, in preparation for a takeoff attempt.  The pilot said that during the downhill takeoff run, the airplane's main wheels struck a series of large bumps.  The pilot said, in part:  ""...when we hit the bumps, just before takeoff, I accidentally closed the throttle, just as we just fell over a fifty feet cliff.""

According to the pilot, during the takeoff/initial climb of the single-engine airplane from runway 32, the engine lost partial power.  The pilot performed the emergency landing procedures, and the airplane impacted the ground beyond the departure end of the runway.  An engine monitoring instrument installed in the aircraft recorded 10 flights of EGTs, CHTs, turbocharger outlet temperature (T1), and the differential between the highest and lowest EGT.  The data indicated the total time from start-up to impact was approximately 8 minutes 40 seconds.  According to the engine manufacturer representative, the data is consistent with ""all six cylinders operating normally for the 8 minutes and 40 seconds from start-up to impact.""  The representative further stated that the cylinder head temperatures (CHTs) recorded are also consistent with ""normal operation, showing an increase over time.""  The data from the previous flights showed similar EGTs and T1 behavior.  Engine examination did not reveal any discrepancies that would have contributed to a power loss.  The weather observation facility located 4 nautical miles from the accident site reported the wind from 190 degrees (160variable240) at 7 knots.

The fuel tanks were filled just before takeoff; there were no known witnesses who observed the takeoff roll.  According to a witness near where the airplane crashed, the airplane was flying at a low altitude and banked to the left.  He thought the airplane was going to hit his house; the engine appeared to him to be running at a low power setting and was also noted to be running rough.  He heard what he reported was a sound he associated with a ""bush hog"", then heard the impact and called 911.  The airplane came to rest on the ground inverted; there was no swath through the trees indicating a gradual descent.  All components necessary to sustain flight were in the immediate vicinity of the crash site; there was no evidence of post crash fire.  Examination of the flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of an approximate 10-inch diameter felled tree at the accident site revealed evidence of 2 propeller strikes; one of the cuts in the tree exhibited black paint transfer.  The first strike was only approximately 1.25 inches deep into the tree and the second was approximately 4 inches deep into the tree.  Examination of the propeller which had the propeller blades painted black on the aft side revealed one propeller blade was bent slightly forward.  The second propeller blade exhibited leading edge twisting towards low pitch, was bent aft approximately 30-degrees, the tip was bent forward, and slight chordwise scratches were noted from the tip inboard approximately 21 inches.  Examination of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Bench testing of the fuel system components revealed no evidence of preimpact failure.  The runway used by the pilot is up sloping approximately 1.5 percent.  Performance calculations from the takeoff distance chart indicated that based on a weather observation at a nearby airport, the distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle was 2,616 feet.

The pilot reported personally fueling the airplane himself the day before the accident from his own fuel tank.  The day of the accident the pilot and 1 passenger departed on an uneventful 20 minute flight to another airport where 1 additional passenger boarded the airplane.  The flight departed and during climbout at 6,500 feet msl with the autopilot engaged, the VFR pilot noted adverse weather ahead as depicted on the airplane's stormscope.  He disengaged the autopilot and turned 90 degrees to the left to avoid the weather.  The flight encountered IMC conditions and a downdraft losing 2,000-3,000 feet of altitude.  The airplane then encountered an updraft during which the airspeed decreased and the engine quit.  The pilot maintained a nose-low attitude to descend and placed the mixture control to the full rich position and turned on the auxiliary fuel pump in an effort to restore engine power.  Engine power was not restored and the pilot performed a forced landing in a planted millet field.  During recovery of the airplane, 28-30 gallons of fuel were noted in the left fuel tank and no fuel was noted in the right fuel tank which was later found to be compromised consisting of a crack.  No fuel leakage was noted at the accident site from the point where the airplane touched down to the point where the airplane came to rest.  Additionally, no fuel stains were noted on the upper or lower surfaces of the right wing.  The fuel vents of both fuel tanks were clear and there were no obstructions of the fuel lines from either fuel tank to the center section of the wing.  A temporary fuel tank was plumbed into the fuel selector valve and with it positioned to the left and right positions, fuel flow was noted at each fuel injector nozzle.  Examination of the engine revealed crankshaft, camshaft, and valve train continuity, no evidence of lack of lubrication was noted.  The impulse couplings and components of both impulse couplings were broken.  Metallurgical examination of the broken components of both impulse couplings revealed that with the exception of the main spring from the impulse coupling of the left magneto, all fracture surfaces exhibited overstress failure.  The main spring of the impulse coupling of the left magneto exhibited fatigue signatures; the spring met specification for material, width, and thickness.  The roll trim motor actuator was positioned to correct for a left wing heavy situation.  According to a representative of the engine manufacturer, the damage to the impulse couplings for both magnetos was consistent with the magnetos being operated over an extended period of time at speeds below 450 magneto rpm.  The airplane was equipped with a fuel caution light that would illuminate if one tank were empty and the other tank held less than 14 gallons of fuel; the light would not illuminate if one tank was empty and the other tank held greater than 14 gallons of fuel.",The poor in-flight planning by the pilot-in-command resulting in the total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.

The glider pilot reported that the towline prematurely released from the tow plane (Piper PA-18). He reported that this occurred shortly after takeoff from runway 28, about 200 feet above ground level (AGL).  After the unscheduled disconnect, the glider pilot initiated a turn to the right in an effort to reach the departure runway.  He reported that during the turn, the glider ""pitched down"" and did not respond to control inputs.  Shortly thereafter, the glider impacted trees and terrain.  This was the second failed attempt to launch the glider; the first attempt resulted in an unscheduled release immediately following the initiation of the tow.  Following the first unscheduled release, the ""Field Manager"" reconnected to towline to the PA-18, and the second tow was initiated.  In both cases, the towline prematurely released from the release hook on the tow aircraft, but remained attached to the latching mechanism on the glider.  The handle for the tow-hitch is located on the floorboard of the tow plane's forward cockpit.  To open the hitch, the handle is moved from the forward position to the aft position.  According to the tow plane pilot, the handle had not been actuated and was in the forward position when the unscheduled releases occurred.  Postaccident examination and testing of the tow-hitch revealed no discrepancies or anomalies that would explain the unscheduled release.  In a  written statement, the glider pilot indicated that he had not been briefed on potential emergency landing sites near the departure field.  Additionally, he stated that had he been briefed, he would have ""...made the decision to fly to such a site given my altitude at release.""

During his second solo cross-country instructional flight, the student pilot reported to the controller that he was lost and low on fuel.  The student told the controller that the left fuel gage indicated FULL and the right fuel gage indicated EMPTY.  The controller issued the student suggested headings to the nearest airport.  The student pilot located the airport and entered the traffic pattern for a landing on runway 17.  During the landing roll to the south, the airplane bounced, exited the runway into the grass, and the student performed a go-around.  Subsequently, the student landed the airplane to the north on runway 35.  Witnesses reported the airplane remained on the runway with the elevators up, flaps retracted, and the propeller turning, before it rolled off the end of the runway at an ""estimated speed of 30 mph.""  Witnesses never saw or heard any indication of braking, nor the addition of power.  The airplane struck a vehicle traveling east at 60 mph on an interstate highway located north of the airport.  Winds at the time of the accident were from the south at 20 knots.  The accident flight time was 2.3 hours.  Examination of the airplane's fuel system and its maintenance records revealed that the original left fuel tank transmitter (manufactured by Stewart Warner) was replaced in October 1999 with a new transmitter (manufactured by Rochester).  Research revealed that by 1991, the Stewart Warner transmitters and fuel gages were no longer procurable for the airplane, and the Rochester transmitters and gages were to be installed by Service Bulletin (SB)/Service Kit (SK).  According to the SB/SK, installation of a Rochester transmitter also requires installation of a Rochester gage.  Neither the SB nor the SK had been complied with on the accident airplane.   The Rochester gage assembly requires an aluminum back plate.   Both fuel gages found in the airplane were Stewart Warner and the back plate was steel.  According to the manufacturer representative, ""with the Rochester transmitter installed with the Stewart Warner fuel gage, the gage indication would increase as the fuel level in the tank got lower.""  Physical evidence of fuel leakage from the left tank was found at the tank, the tank fitting, and the inboard wing where the tank was installed.  No evidence was found of an in-flight mechanical and or flight/control malfunction that would have rendered the airplane uncontrollable prior to the impact.","The student pilot's improper decision making in that he landed with a tailwind and failed to execute a go-around, which resulted in a runway overrun.

According to the operator who inspected the airplane and interviewed the instructor, the airplane was topped off with 13.4 gallons of aviation gasoline and placed in the maintenance shop just prior to the flight.  The airplane received new tires and was released from the shop.  No other maintenance was performed.  The airplane departed at 1200 with full fuel tanks, which was 22.5 gallons of useable fuel.  The instructor had stated that shortly after takeoff, about 1,000 feet, there was a ""popping"" sound from the engine followed by a loss of engine power.  He repositioned the mixture and throttle controls, but with no effect.  He stated that he pitched the airplane to attain best glide speed and initiated a forced landing procedure.  The airplane landed in rough terrain and was nosed over.  The entire back portion of the muffler was open.  There was evidence of sooting and discoloration of the firewall directly behind the left muffler.  The fuel input line leading from the gascolator to the carburetor was positioned between the aft end of the left muffler and the firewall.  It was approximately 3 inches away from the open end of the muffler and was heated substantially when the back end of the muffler blew off.  The heat most likely caused the fuel in the line to vaporize, resulting in vapor lock.  The lack of altitude and time did not allow the engine to re-fire after the fuel in the line cooled off.","The failure of the muffler assembly causing a fuel line to overheat, resulting in vapor lock, and a subsequent engine failure followed by an emergency landing in rough terrain."

He found that the brake was inoperative during his pre-flight inspection, from a write-up left by the previous pilot.  He talked to the CAP wing maintenance officer, and together they agreed that the pilot would ferry the airplane to another airport for maintenance.  He departed without incident.  In the landing pattern at the destination airport, the pilot elected to land with a 10-knot quartering tailwind with no flaps.  He was unable to stop the airplane on the 5,000-foot runway, and it ran off the departure end.  The airplane went through a ditch, and came to rest inverted in a cornfield.  An aluminum brake line attached to the right side tubular steel landing gear strut had chaffed against the aluminum covering over the strut, and developed a leak near the lower end of the strut.  Dried hydraulic fluid was found inside the aluminum covering.  The mechanic who performed the last inspection stated that he did not normally remove the aluminum fairings which were installed over the tubular steed landing gear strut.","The pilot's improper decision to fly the airplane with a known deficiency, and his inflight decision to land with a quartering tailwind.  A factor was the wing maintenance officer's concurrence to fly the airplane with the known deficiency."

The airplane was destroyed when it impacted the ground in a steep descent.  Witnesses reported seeing the airplane in level flight prior to making a steep descent and subsequently impacting the ground.  The examination of the control system revealed no anomalies that could be identified as existing prior to the impact.  No other mechanical deficiencies were found that could be identified as existing prior to the impact.  There was a white radial mark on the face of the airspeed indicator beyond the 200 miles per hour mark.","The airplane's departure from level flight and subsequent impact with the terrain as a result of a maneuver initiated by the pilot, and the pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the terrain.

Pilot-witnesses said the pilot was performing low-level aerobatics. As he pulled up into a near-vertical attitude he radioed, ""My engine just quit."" Smoke was seen coming from the engine cowling. The airplane appeared to do a tail slide, then it rolled left and nosed over. Witnesses surmised that the airplane stalled with insufficient altitude to recover. It struck the ground in a left wing-low, nose-low attitude. Wreckage was spread in a fan-shaped pattern. The pilot's wife (and his aerobatic partner) believed he was making a ""yo-yo turn...essentially, a steep wingover."" To test her theory, she later flew her airplane and performed several of these maneuvers. She found that she could cause the engine to quit by pulling up steeply, then pushing over into a dive for several seconds. Power would suddenly surge to 2,500 rpm. The pilot's wife surmised that the engine failed when he pulled up. As he recovered, the engine regained power and surged, and the resultant torque caused the airplane to roll. No anomalies were noted during the engine disassembly and inspection.","a nonmechanical total loss of engine power for undetermined reasons while performing an aerobatic maneuver, and an inadvertent stall. A contributing factor was the insuffieient altitude to effect a safe recovery."

The helicopter was in cruise flight over the Gulf of Mexico when it began to vibrate and shudder.  The pilot lowered the collective control to initiate an autorotation and the engine lost power.  During the ensuing autorotation, the helicopter's floats were deployed.  The pilot attempted to decelerate the helicopter; however, the controls became stiff, and subsequently, the helicopter hit the water hard.  Examination of the helicopter's fuel system revealed that the fuel nozzle inlet screen was collapsed and the screen was 80 to 90% contaminated with a brown material with a polymeric-like to varnish-like appearance.  The screen was examined by a laboratory, and it was determined that DIEGME, a fuel additive used as an icing inhibitor, was present on the screen.  The helicopter's operating environment is such that salt water could have been introduced into the fuel system.  The presence of water and fuel would allow bacteria to grow.  The combination of bacterial growth, DIEGME, and water resulted in the formation of an ""apple-jelly"" type material, which then adhered to the fuel system components (fuel nozzle screen).  The blockage and collapse of the fuel nozzle screen resulted in an interruption of fuel flow, and the subsequent loss of engine power.","fuel contamination due to the combination of DIEGME, water, and bacterial growth, which resulted in formation of an apple-jelly type material that blocked the fuel nozzle screen and led to a loss of engine power."

The student pilot was practicing touch-and-go takeoffs and landings.  He had landed, retracted the flaps, and applied full throttle.  He then realized that he was left of the runway centerline.  He applied right rudder to correct the situation, then ""applied too much left rudder to straighten the plane's roll causing the plane to veer to the left.""  The left main landing gear departed the runway surface.  The airplane was headed toward a taxiway light, so the pilot ""steered the plane into the infield grass area.""

The pilot performed a preflight inspection of the airplane and drained fuel samples from both wing sump drains, and the fuselage sump drain.  The pilot observed about 1/4-inch of water, in a 4-inch sample of fuel taken from the right wing fuel sump drain.  The pilot stated that he did not drain the fuel again to determine if the water was out of the tank.  The pilot then performed a run-up inspection and initiated a takeoff.  The airplane obtained an altitude of 300 feet, when the engine ""stopped completely.""  The pilot then performed a forced landing into trees.  Examination of the airplane revealed corrosion on the right wing fuel cap, and inside the right fuel tank.  The carburetor was disassembled and the carburetor bowl was ""about 1/3 full of water,"" and contaminated by a ""brownish substance.""  Thumb compression and valve train continuity was confirmed to all cylinders by manual rotation of the propeller.  The airplane was last fueled about 1 month prior to the accident with 16.7 gallons, and ""a significant amount of rain"" had fallen in the area since then.","The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel contamination."

The pilot reported he was giving rides in the antique aircraft to thank museum volunteers of the Confederate Air Force squadron.  Before takeoff, the aircraft was fueled to capacity, which he reported was sufficient for 2 hours endurance.  About 20 minutes after takeoff, while in normal cruise flight and without warning, the engine lost power.  During the ensuing forced landing in an open field, the landing gear struck a culvert and a wing was damaged.  Post-accident inspection revealed that a clevis on the throttle linkage separated from the rod at the cockpit control quadrant.  The operator, a (civilian) military aircraft museum, believed that the throttle linkage had been field fabricated, or refurbished and installed during restoration of the World War II-era airplane, 358 flight hours prior.  A rivet, intended to lock the clevis to the shaft, was never installed during the fabrication/reassembly of the linkage, and the absence of the rivet was not detected during subsequent annual inspections.","The improper fabrication/reassembly and inspection of the engine throttle control linkage during aircraft restoration by the operator, and the failure of the operator's inspection personnel to detect the error during subsequent annual inspections."

While departing from the airport, with the second-in-command (SIC) at the controls, the airplane impacted a fence, and subsequently the ground about 1,000 feet beyond the departure end of the runway.  A witness on the ramp area south of the runway, stated that he heard the engines spool up; however, due to the fog, he could only see the strobe lights on the airplane.  He then observed the airplane rotate about 3,500 feet from the departure end of the runway and begin to climb at a steep angle, before losing sight of it when it was about 150 feet above ground level.  The weather reported, at 0550 was, calm winds; 1/2 statute miles of visibility, fog; overcast cloud layer at 100 feet; temperature and dew point of 17 degrees Celsius.  Excerpts of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript revealed that the flightcrew discussed the prevailing visibility at the airport on numerous occasions, and indicated that it appeared to be less than one mile.  Examination of the wreckage revealed no anomalies with the airframe or engines.  According to the FAA Instrument Flying Handbook, ""Flying in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) can result in sensations that are misleading to the body's sensory system...A rapid acceleration, such as experienced during takeoff, stimulates the otolith organs in the same way as tilting the head backwards.  This action creates the somatogravic illusion of being in a nose-up attitude, especially in situations without good visual references.  The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low or dive attitude.""","The pilot's failure to maintain a proper climb rate while taking off at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation.

The airline transport rated pilot was attempting to land under visual flight rules for a scheduled passenger pick-up and subsequent charter flight.  The pilot was communicating with a pilot at the airport, who was utilizing a hand held radio.  The accident pilot reported he was not able to see the runway lights due to ground fog and continued to circle the airport for about 20 minutes.  The pilot on the ground stated the airplane appeared to be about 1,500 feet above the ground when it circled, and then entered a downwind for runway 26.  He was not able to hear or see the airplane as it flew away from the airport.  He then began to hear the airplane during its final approach.  The airplane's engines sounded normal.  He then heard a ""terrible sound of impact,"" followed by silence.  When he arrived at the accident site, the airplane was fully engulfed in flames.  The airplane impacted trees about 80-feet tall, located about 2,000 feet from, and on a 240 degree course to the approach end of runway 26.  Several freshly broken tree limbs and trunks, up to 15-inches in diameter, were observed strewn along a debris path, which measured 370 feet.  Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any pre-impact malfunctions.  The weather reported at an airport about 19 miles south-southeast of the accident site, included a visibility of 1 3/4 miles, in mist, with clear skies and a temperature and dew point of 17 degrees Celsius.  Witnesses in the area of the accident site generally described conditions of ""thick fog"" and a resident who lived across from the accident site stated visibility was ""near zero"" and he could barely see across the road.","The pilot's improper decision to attempt a visual landing under instrument meteorological conditions and his failure to maintain adequate altitude/clearance, which resulted in an in-flight collision with trees.

The pilot completed the landing check and verified that the landing gear cockpit indicators light showed that the landing gear was down and locked position. The pilot continued the approach and the airplane touched down with the left wheel retracted. The subsequent examination of the airplane revealed that the left main landing gear extension rod was bent. The landing gear extension rod was replaced, and a successful functional check of the landing gear system was accomplished. According to the flying club assistant chief pilot, this airplane was used for training, and the origin of the extension rod deformation was not determined. Additionally, the pilot had no means of verifying when the main and nose gear assemblies are in the extended and locked positions.",The failure of the left landing gear extention rod for undetermined reasons that resulted in a landing with the gear retracted.

The transport airplane sustained substantial damage during landing when it veered off the left side of runway 27 at 0111 cst and both engines sustained foreign object damage (FOD).  Level 4 and 5 thunderstorms were in the vicinity of the airport at the time of the accident.  The ASOS rain gauge on the airport indicated 0.42 inches of rain fell between 0100 and 0111.  The wind was from the northwest at less than 10 knots, and no significant low-level windshear was present at the time of the accident.  The first officer was the flying pilot.  The Flight Data Recorder data indicated the airplane was on a stabilized instrument approach with the autopilot engaged until about 200 feet above ground level (agl), when the autopilot was disconnected and the airplane was flown manually.  After the autopilot disconnect, the airplane began drifting left and above glide slope.  The airplane crossed the runway threshold at about 57 feet agl, offset about 65 feet left of centerline, but the ground track was being corrected back toward centerline.  A flare was initiated about 600 feet past the runway threshold and about 35 feet agl.  During the flare, the ground track achieved the centerline, but deviated back to the left before main gear touchdown, which occurred about 3,200 feet past the runway threshold.  At touchdown, the left main gear was about 56 feet left of centerline with an airplane ground track of about 5 degrees to the left.  Within 2 seconds of touchdown (about 300 feet of travel), the left main gear crossed the white runway edge strip, and within 5 seconds of touchdown (about 1,000 feet of travel), the left main gear departed the paved surface.  A nearly full right rudder input was made at about 3,450 feet from the runway threshold after main gear touchdown.  The airplane departed the runway surface before the ground track altered back to the right.  The company's Operations Manual states, ""Control Glidepath so that touchdown occurs on the 1000 foot point (Fixed Distance Marker)...If an unsatisfactory approach is likely to result in a long landing, GO AROUND and make a second approach.""","The second in command failed to maintain proper runway alignment, directional control, and landed long.

The airplane collided with a fence during an aborted takeoff.  The pilot flew to Fullerton on Tuesday, August 21, and noted no discrepancies.  The airplane was full of fuel, and everything checked normal during preflight, taxi, and engine run-up.  During the departure, the pilot applied full throttle and noted 38.5 inches of manifold pressure at 2,500 rpm.  He crosschecked instruments and his alignment.  He was approaching midfield and noted his airspeed was above 65 knots, but not increasing.  The manifold pressure looked the same, but the rpm was below 2,500; he thought it had dropped about 100 rpm.  The airplane did not feel or sound like it was accelerating.  He had not detected any hesitation in the engine, and did not hear any metallic sounds.  He elected to abort the takeoff as he passed midfield and pulled the throttle back.  He was unable to stop on the runway and collided with an airport boundary fence about 20 feet past the end of the runway shearing off the landing gear and substantially damaging the left wing.  During post accident examination of the airplane, the pilot started the engine using his normal procedures.  The propeller cycled normally, and both magnetos dropped 50 rpm on the magneto check.  The pilot ran the engine up to full takeoff power, and all instruments, including manifold pressure and rpm, went to their red (maximum) limit marks.

During nighttime conditions, the airplane approached runway 09, a 2,156-foot long, 50-foot wide, asphalt runway.  The airplane touched down near the opposite end of the runway, almost on the numbers ""27.""  The engine then revved, and the airplane initially climbed, but it turned left and struck transmission wires.  The tower that supported the transmission wires was approximately 133 feet tall, and unlighted.  It was located adjacent to the runway, about 1,260 feet northeast of the departure end of runway 09.  Additionally, there 56-foot tall transmission wires located approximately 860 feet beyond the departure end of the runway, and perpendicular to it.  However, review of an Information Manual for the make and model airplane revealed sufficient horizontal distance remained for the airplane to climb above those wires.  The pilot obtained his private pilot certificate 4 days prior to the accident.  According to his logbook, the pilot had a total flight experience of 87 hours, of which, about 12 hours were in the same make and model as the accident airplane.  The pilot also had a total nighttime flying experience of approximately 5 hours.  The reported wind about 5 minutes after the accident, at an airport about 10 miles southeast of the accident site was from 210 degrees at 8 knots.","The pilot's failure to maintain runway alignment during the initial climb.  Factors were the pilot's failure to perform a go-around, the pilot's lack of flight experience in nighttime conditions, the nighttime conditions, and a tailwind."

The pilot reported that the airspeed indicator was operative during the takeoff roll.  However, after becoming airborne, it returned to zero, and stayed there.  The pilot remained in the traffic pattern and returned for a landing.  Full flaps were added prior to touchdown.  Upon initial touchdown, the airplane bounced.  The pilot added power, and when he removed the power, the airplane bounced again.  The pilot reported that the airplane bounced at least twice prior to departing the right side of the runway.  Witnesses reported it bounced five or six times.  The nose landing gear tire was blown, the firewall was wrinkled, and the supporting structure behind the firewall was bent.",An inoperative airspeed indicator and the pilot's improper recovery from the bounced landing.

The certificated flight instructor and dual student were conducting a simulated emergency landing immediately after takeoff. According to the flight instructor, the flight instructor briefed the dual student on the procedures and stated that the flight instructor would maintain priority on the controls with the dual student to follow. At 150 feet AGL, the instructor reduced the throttle to idle and pitched the airplane nose-low to maintain airspeed. The student pilot reported actively pulling back on the yoke at 50 feet AGL. As the flight instructor attempted the flare, the airplane struck the runway and sustained substantial damage to the propeller, nose gear, left main landing gear, firewall, floor, and bottom of the fuselage back to the baggage door.","The flight instructor's improper flare of the airplane, which resulted in a hard landing. Factors were the dual student's failure to relinquish control of the airplane and the dual student's interference on the flight controls."

After takeoff, the airplane climbed to approximately 200 feet above ground level, then lost engine power. The pilot attempted to return to the runway. During the maneuver, airspeed was not maintained, and the airplane stalled and dove straight into the ground. Fuel was observed leaking from the wreckage at the accident site. The engine was removed for examination, and the drive train rotated freely when manipulated by hand.  All three propeller blades were found broken off the hub. Examination of the engine and flight controls revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunction.  Diazepam (valium), a prescription medication, was detected during the toxicological examination.","The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed while performing an emergency maneuver, resulting in a stall and an uncontrolled descent, and the subsequent collision with terrain.

During an aerial fire suppression mission for the California Department of Forestry (CDF), two Grumman TS-2A airplanes, operating as Tanker 92 (N442DF) and Tanker 87 (N450DF), collided in flight while in a holding pattern awaiting a retardant drop assignment on the fire.  All of the airplanes fighting the fire were TS-2A's, painted in identical paint schemes.  The Air Tactical Group Supervisor (AirTac) was orbiting clockwise 1,000 feet above the tankers, who were in a counterclockwise orbit at 3,000 feet mean sea level (msl).  The pilots of both aircraft involved in the collision had previously made several drops on the fire.  Records from the Air Tac show that Tankers 86, 91, and 92 were in orbit, and investigation found that Tanker 87 was inbound to enter the orbit after reloading at a nearby airport base.  AirTac would write down the tanker numbers as they made their 3-minutes-out call, and usually ordered their drops in the same order as their check-in.  The AirTac's log recorded the sequence 86, 91, 21, and 92.  The log did not contain an entry for Tanker 87.  Other pilots on frequency did not recall hearing Tanker 87 check in.  Based on clock codes with 12-o'clock being north, the tankers were in the following approximate positions of the orbit when the collision occurred.  Tanker 92 was at the 2-o'clock position; Tanker 86 was turning in at the 5-o'clock position; and Tanker 91 was in the 7-o'clock position.  The AirTac's log indicated that Tanker 92 was going to move up in sequence and follow Tanker 86 in order to drop immediately after him.  Post accident examination determined that Tanker 92's flaps were down, indicating that the pilot had configured the airplane for a drop.  Tanker 92 swung out of the orbit wide (in an area where ground witnesses had not seen tankers all day) to move behind Tanker 86, and the pilot would likely have been focusing on Tanker 86 out of his left side window.  Tanker 87 was on line direct to the center of the fire on a path that witnesses had not observed tankers use that day.  Reconstruction of the positions of the airplanes disclosed that Tankers 86 and 91 would have been directly in front of Tanker 87, and Tanker 92 would have been wide to his left.  Ground witnesses said that Tanker 87 had cleared a ridgeline just prior to the collision, and this ridgeline could have masked both collision aircraft from the visual perspective of the respective pilots.  The right propeller, engine, and cockpit of Tanker 92 contacted and separated the empennage of Tanker 87.  The propeller chop was about 47 degrees counterclockwise to the longitudinal axis of Tanker 87 as viewed from the top.  The collision appeared to have occurred about 2,500 feet, which was below orbit altitude.  CDF had no standard operating manual, no established reporting or entry point for the holding orbits, and a tanker could enter any point of the orbit from any direction.  While no standardized procedures were encoded in an operating manual,  a CDF training syllabus noted that a tanker was not to enter an orbit until establishing positive radio contact with the AirTac.  The entering tanker would approach 1,000 feet below AirTac's altitude and stay in a left orbit that was similar to a salad bowl, high and wide enough to see and clear all other tankers until locating the tanker that it was to follow, then adjust speed and altitude to fall in behind the preceding airplane.",the failure of both pilots to maintain an adequate visual lookout.  The failure of the pilot in Tanker 87 to comply with suggested procedures regarding positive radio contact and orbit entry was a factor.

Several witnesses reported hearing the experimental, reduced scale World War II Hawker Hurricane's engine ""sputtering,"" and a third witness reported hearing the same sound and then observing the aircraft crash at the north end of the 2,650 foot long, North/South oriented, grass airstrip.   A fourth witness, located along the runway, reported hearing the aircraft having engine problems while the aircraft was approaching to land from south to north.  He further reported that as the aircraft approached the runway, the engine quit and that the aircraft continued flying north until reaching the north end of the runway at which time the plane pulled up to ""tree top level""  appearing to attempt a turn back to the runway, and then fell back to the ground nose first.  Post-crash examination of the aircraft's engine revealed no mechanical malfunction, and fuel was found in the aircraft's main tanks but the header tank was ruptured.  A satellite photograph of the airstrip and surrounding area revealed approximately 1,500 feet of open field directly north of the crash site as confirmed by an FAA inspector at the site.  Toxicological evaluation of blood samples from the pilot revealed Diphenhydramine, commonly known by the trade name ""Benadryl,"" an antihistamine.  The level of Diphenhydramine found in the pilot's blood was reported as being consistent with several times the normal dosage within an eight-hour period.  In such doses, the medication commonly results in drowsiness, and has measurable effects on performance of complex cognitive and motor tasks.","A loss of power for undetermined reasons, and the pilot's inflight decision to attempt a 180 degree turn back to the runway from low altitude and his failure to maintain sufficient flying airspeed during the turn.  A contributing factor was drug impairment of the pilot as a result of higher than normal levels of Benedryl, an antihistamine which affects the ability to perform complex cognitive and motor tasks."

The commercial certificated pilot was departing his private airstrip on runway 24.  The airstrip is 2,200 feet long, and is located at 1,875 feet msl.  In a telephone conversation with the NTSB IIC, the pilot said he added full engine power, and pushed the carburetor heat control off when he began the takeoff run.  The airplane lifted off to about 20 feet agl near the departure end of the runway.  The pilot said the airplane did not seem to be climbing and he aborted the takeoff by closing the engine throttle and intentionally stalling the airplane into trees at the departure end of the runway.  The airplane received damage to the wings, fuselage, and landing gear.  The pilot said the weather conditions at the time of the accident were broken clouds about 6,000 feet; unlimited visibility; temperature about 62 degrees F; and light wind from 240 degrees.  In the narrative portion of the NTSB Pilot/Operator Report submitted by the pilot, the pilot said the ""carburetor heat control was out (heat was on).""","The pilot's delay in aborting the takeoff.  Factors in the accident were the presence of trees at the end of the departure path, and the pilot's improper use of the carburetor heat control."

The Air Tractor collided with trees and the ground during an attempted forced landing after a loss of engine power. According to the pilot, the engine power lost power during climb out from a swath run. As the pilot established a glide toward a hay field for an emergency landing, he attempted to restore engine power. The airplane struck trees, then the ground and caught fire. The post-crash fire prevented a functional examination of the airplane and engine assembly.",The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.

The airplane sustained substantial damage during a forced landing after takeoff.  The airplane departed runway 33 after a touch and go when it experienced a loss of engine power at 100 - 150 feet agl.  The pilot attempted to land on runway 09 but impacted the ground on the right side of the runway.  The instructor pilot reported, ""...  we were at approximately 100-150 feet in the air when I detected a deceleration and a reduction in engine noise...Going through a quick mental checklist I checked the throttle and applied carburetor heat, with no improvement in engine performance.  Realizing a complete engine failure had occurred and that we were loosing altitude, I immediately took the controls.  I lowered the nose to maintain airspeed to prevent a stall and turned to land on runway 9, the only safe area, in my opinion, to land, due to the trees and parked aircraft ahead of us.  I completed the turn over the runway, loosing altitude rapidly.  Touch down was at a high rate of descent with the left wing slightly up.

The airplane sustained substantial damage on impact with terrain and objects after traveling off the end of the runway during a main wheels up landing.  The captain reported that prior to takeoff, he closed the cargo door and the copilot confirmed the door light was out.  After takeoff at an altitude of about 600 feet, the cockpit door popped open and the crew noticed the cargo door was open.  The captain elected to return to land.  The captain reported he requested repeatedly for gear and flaps extension, but the copilot was late in doing so and it ""caused us to overshoot the runway centerline.""  The copilot then began calling for a go around/missed approach at which time he raised the gear and the retracted some of the flaps.  The copilot reported the captain continued to descend toward the runway and overshot the runway centerline to the right.  The copilot reported that at this time he lowered the gear.  The nose gear extended prior to touchdown, however the main gear did not.  The airplane touched down approximately 1/2 way down the runway and traveled off the end.  A witness reported noticing that the exterior door latch was not down as the airplane taxied to the runway.","The wheels up landing performed by the flightcrew during the emergency landing and improper aircraft preflight by the pilot in command.

The airplane was substantially damaged during a takeoff roll on runway 1L (6,700 feet by 100 feet, dry grooved concrete).  A wind from 050 degrees at 10 knots was recorded by the airport's automated surface observing system.  The airplane veered towards the left when the pilot deselected nose wheel steering at approximately 60 knots.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the trailing edge flaps and their respective cockpit control were in the 1/2 flap position.   Two of left propeller's start locks were engaged.  The third start lock was damaged.  Two of the right propeller's start locks were not engaged.  The right propellar's remaining start lock cam had a witness mark prior to the locking point of the cam.  The airplane's checklist states that the flaps are to be in the retracted position and the engine's start locks are to be disengaged prior to takeoff.  Also, the airplane flight manual does not have performance data for  takeoff configurations with 1/2  flaps.   Examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies.",the checklist not followed and the directional control not maintained by the pilot.

Shortly after takeoff (approximately 30 feet above the ground), the aircraft began to lose power.  The pilot said the aircraft lost the ability to climb at about 60 feet above ground level.  Due to a barn in his flight path, he turned the airplane toward an alfalfa field to make an emergency landing.  The engine continued to loose power and attempts to regain engine power failed.  The airplane's speed began to decrease and approach a stall.  The airplane contacted the ground with its right wing first, then rotated until its heading was 180 degrees from its flight path, subsequently coming to rest against a fence.  Postaccident examination of the engine by the pilot revealed that both piston rings had failed.  The owner reported that the engine had approximately 4 hours of flight operation time.

During a practice autorotation, the helicopter landed hard bending the tail boom.  An examination of the helicopter indicated the damage resulted from the hard landing.  The tail boom had ripped out at the aft bulkhead, and the landing skids were bent upward at the aft end.  The nose of the helicopter was also damaged when the helicopter rocked forward after the hard landing.  The helicopter then stopped upright on the skids with no damage to the main rotor blades.  The pilot stated that he was doing a practice autorotation landing when the accident occurred.  During the last landing, the helicopter ""fell through"" much faster than anticipated.  The pilot stated that no mechanical anomalies were experienced prior to or after the accident.  The temperature at the time of the accident was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  The pilot stated that in the future he will allow a higher margin for autorotation power recovery in hot conditions.",The pilot's improper autorotation in that he failed to attain the proper descent rate resulting in a hard landing and subsequent airframe damage.

The operator reported that shortly after departure the first officer noted stiffness in the flight controls when attempting to roll the airplane to the left.  After assessing the situation, the captain elected to continue the climb.  Shortly after level off, the crew noted that the stiffness increased proportionally with airspeed.  This was also noted during the descent phase of the flight, specifically, the first officer stated the resistance increased for left roll inputs as the aircraft accelerated.  The captain reported that they attempted to relieve the pressure with aileron trim, however, when the trim indicator reached the first index on the indicator, the control wheel ""snapped"" approximately 25 degrees and the airplane banked to the right.  The crew reported that as the airplane slowed, while on approach, the roll control stiffness decreased.  After landing, the crew accomplished a full control check and noted no abnormal indications with the ailerons or spoilers.  Post flight inspection disclosed a number of discrepancies that are believed to have contributed to the stiff flight controls.  The items are as follows: the right control yoke chain tension was high; the right aileron spring tab hinge bearing did not rotate freely; the left aileron spring tab aft spring tension was low and the contact stud was worn; the right aileron spring tab tension was low and the contact stud was worn; the left aileron hinge bearing did not rotate freely.",Improper tension of the right control yoke chain; a worn right aileron spring tab hinge bearing; improper tension of the left aileron spring tab aft spring and worn contact stud; improper tension of the right aileron spring tab and a worn contact stud; a worn left aileron hinge bearing.

The accident aircraft was assembled for flight at the airport immediately before the accident flight.  The pilot reported that following a normal takeoff and climbout, at approximately 150 feet above ground level and 50 MPH, he experienced a simultaneous reduction in airspeed and rate of climb. The airport owner reported that he watched the aircraft take off and get to an altitude about 200 to 250 feet above the runway when it began to flounder and mush as it drifted off to the right of the runway.  The airport owner reported that the aircraft then settled into the trees and crashed.  The airport owner stated that the aircraft took what he felt was an excessive take off roll, about 1,000 feet, and that the aircraft did not appear to have an excessive angle of attack as the aircraft climbed out.  He also stated that the engine appeared to be operating normally and that he did not notice any power loss.  The airport owner reported that the winds at the airport surface were calm when the accident happened.  METAR weather observations at several nearby weather observation facilities near the time of the accident reported generally northerly to northwesterly or variable winds at 5 to 7 knots, with clear skies or few clouds and no significant temperature or pressure gradients across the area.  According to performance specifications published by the aircraft kit manufacturer, a comparable model in the Kitfox line with power loading in the range of the accident aircraft has a takeoff roll of 250 feet, a climb rate of 1,200 to 1,450 feet per minute, and a stall speed of 37 MPH.",The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during climbout.

The private certificated pilot was departing toward the north from a remote area that was about 700 feet long and 40 feet wide.  The pilot said he had utilized the area for landing in the past.  The terrain below the takeoff area had several trees, and then an open area of tall grass.  The pilot said the airplane lifted off the ground during the takeoff run, but then seemed to ""mush"" downward.  He lowered the nose of the airplane but the left wing collided with a tree about 20 feet above the ground.  The pilot then pulled the engine power off, and the airplane descended into the area of grass.

The captain and the first officer were landing a short takeoff and landing (STOL) cargo airplane on a private, dirt and gravel surface runway.  The airplane was configured for landing with 40 degrees of flaps.  During the landing approach, variations in indicated airspeed and ground speed indicated windshear conditions.   About 100 to 200 feet above the ground, the airplane encountered a downdraft and began to drift to the right of the runway centerline.  The captain said she increased engine power and applied full left aileron and rudder, but could not gain directional or pitch control of the airplane.  The right wing struck trees, short of the runway threshold, increasing the airplane's right yaw. The captain said that as the airplane neared the ground, she pulled the engine throttles off.  The airplane struck the ground with the right main landing gear and right front portion of the fuselage.  The airplane then pivoted to the right, 180 degrees from the approach heading.  The owner of the airport reported that wind conditions from the east may produce downdrafts in the area of runway 05.  He indicated that at the time of the accident, the wind was blowing from the east about 15 knots.  The first officer reported the captain appeared to be attempting to maintain a stabilized approach angle by varying the pitch attitude of the airplane.  A review of company training literature revealed that the airplane is especially sensitive to slight wind shear, and wind gusts as low as 5 knots when operating at low airspeeds.  Pilots are cautioned that when flying the aircraft at low speeds, a large application of the aileron control may be required to maintain wings level.  During gusty wind conditions, the threshold airspeed should be increased by one-half the gust factor, and any lateral displacement should be corrected rapidly.  If a wing is allowed to drop beyond corrective action of full aileron, power should be increased immediately to regain level flight.","The captain's failure to maintain the proper glidepath, and improper short field landing procedures.  Factors in the accident were a downdraft, and the captain's inadequate evaluation of the weather conditions."

The pilot had sprayed two fields and was enroute to a third  field when the engine lost power. After efforts by the pilot to restore full power failed, the pilot selected a nearby field and executed an emergency descent for an emergency landing. During touchdown and landing roll,  the airplane collided with an embankment. The examination of the airplane at the accident site, revealed that the throttle linkage to the carburetor was not connected. The examination disclosed that the cable assembly was worn beyond servicable limits. The maintenance history of the cable assembly was not determined.",The loss of engine power due to the loss of throttle cable continunity. The throttle cable linkage was worn beyond servicable limits. A factor was uneven terrain at the emergency landing site.

The pilot reported that he knew the right brake was ""soft,"" prior to his intended departure, ""but he felt it would be ok for this flight.""  As the pilot taxied to the runway for departure, the right brake ""failed"" and the airplane traveled off the end of the runway and down a 10-foot embankment.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the right brake lining was worn ""significantly,"" which permitted the brake cylinder to extend beyond its limits, and the brake fluid to seep past the cylinder seal.  Examination of the airplane logbooks revealed that the last annual inspection was performed 11 months prior to the accident.  No maintenance had been performed to the brakes since that date.","The pilot's operation of the airplane with known deficiencies.  Also causal was the loss of brake pressure, which resulted in the failure of the right brake, and subsequent loss of control of the airplane."

A second pilot in another airplane of the same (experimental, amateur built) type flew in loose formation with the accident aircraft and witnessed the accident.  The second pilot said that the pilot's airplane had a heavier engine than most of the type did, and had a ""full panel"" of instruments and radios and was equipped for instrument flight.  The pilot told him that, with the heavier engine and instrumentation, he was ""over gross"" with himself, baggage, and fuel onboard.  He was carrying camping gear and the density altitude at the accident site was approximately 8,000 feet.  After takeoff, the pilot was flying below and in front of the second pilot at an altitude that placed him below the canyon walls.  The second pilot radioed to him ""you should climb,"" and the pilot radioed back that he was taking pictures.  About 1 mile further, it appeared that the pilot started climbing.  He was keeping even with gently upsloping terrain ahead and was in no danger at that point.  The pilot then made a right turn into a narrow canyon that would take him across a ridgeline toward a scenic canyon.  Flying behind him, it took the second pilot a moment to reach the entrance to the canyon and, when he did, he was immediately uncomfortable.  Even from his higher altitude the second pilot was barely level with the ridgeline ahead.  He radioed to the pilot that he should ""do a 180 . . . there is room to your right.""  At this point he had sufficient space to his right to reverse course.  The pilot radioed back words to the effect that he thought he could make it and would proceed ahead.  The second pilot radioed that he was turning immediately and that the pilot had plenty of spacing and was clear of terrain.  When he started his climbing left turn he last saw the accident airplane below and in front of him, hugging the left canyon wall.  It appeared the pilot was setting up to make a right turn out of the canyon.  He appeared to be in a climbing attitude.  When the second pilot completed his 360-degree turn, he next saw the airplane in a 45-degree right bank as it entered a spin to the right at about 300 feet agl.  The spin continued for 2 1/2 turns and the airplane impacted terrain below and a fire erupted.  It appeared that the spin slowed and a partial recovery was made just before the impact.  In the immediate area where the accident occurred the canyon was closing; there was rising terrain ahead and insufficient canyon width to turn around.  The second pilot said there was no transmission (on the radio) of any mechanical problem and, as he watched the aircraft spin, it appeared that the airplane was structurally intact.","The failure of the pilot to initiate a course reversal in a timely manner after flying into a box canyon and his failure to maintain airspeed during the attempted course reversal, which resulted in a stall spin."

After an uneventful touchdown, the tailwheel-equipped aircraft began veering to the right during the landing roll. Although the pilot applied full left rudder, the aircraft did not respond. The pilot therefore applied partial left braking along with the full left rudder deflection. Although this caused the aircraft to begin tracking straight, the tail lifted off the ground and it began to nose over. When it started to nose over, the pilot released the brake application, but the aircraft continued over onto its back. It was later determined that the right brake was dragging/binding during the landing roll, and the amount of left brake necessary to keep the aircraft tracking straight resulted in the aircraft nosing over.",The binding/grabbing of the right main gear braking system during the landing roll.

The private certificated pilot applied full engine power to begin the takeoff roll on runway 36 from a private airstrip.  The airstrip has a gravel surface runway that is 4,700 feet long, and 75 feet wide.  The pilot said the left main landing gear tire encountered a rut on the runway, and the airplane began to veer to the left.  The airplane began to depart the runway surface off the left side of the airstrip, and the pilot said she aborted the takeoff.  The airplane continued to the left and collided with a stack of cut wood logs.  Both the main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane received damage to the propeller, fuselage, wings, and wing lift struts.

The airplane was on autopilot in instrument meteorological conditions, descending through 17,000 feet at 280 knots.  It was being operated in an area of convective activity, with cells about 20 nautical miles on either side of the flight path.  There were no radar echoes in the path of flight.  The captain notified the flight attendant that the ""ride may be bumpy,"" and had her sit down.  The seat belt sign was illuminated, and a general announcement about potential turbulence was made.  Approximately 10 minutes after the announcement, severe turbulence was encountered.  The flight attendant, who had gotten up after thinking the area of turbulence had passed, was then seriously injured.  There was no specific guidance in the company's flight operations manual about seating cabin crewmembers in anticipation of turbulence.  As a result of the investigation, and after coordination with the senior manager of flight safety for the airline, guidance was published that included a requirement that cabin crewmembers remain seated until advised by the captain.","Inadequate company procedures/directives, which resulted in the flight attendant leaving her seat prematurely, while the airplane was still in an area of turbulence."

The amateur built, experimental airplane was destroyed by impact forces and subsequent ground fire about 1 mile west of the destination airport.  The airplane departed controlled flight prior to ground impact.  A witness reported the airplane was flying at about 500 feet above ground level (agl) and was circling towards the airport when the airplane ""barreled"" left, recovered, and then the nose of the airplane went straight down.  Another witness reported seeing the airplane circling before the airplane nose dived into the terrain.  The wreckage path was limited to the initial point of impact.  The leading edges of the left and right wings were crushed and buckled aft along their outboard wing spans.  The post accident inspection of the airplane revealed no preexisting anomalies.  The Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report prepared by the Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aeromedical Institute indicated that 0.019 (ug/ml, ug/g) Tetrahydrocannabinol (Marihuana) and 0.043 (ug/ml, ug/g) Tetrahydrocannabinol Carboxylic Acid (Marihuana) were detected in the pilot's blood.",The pilot inadvertently stalled the airplane.

The airplane contacted a drainage ditch off the end of the runway after hydroplaning during the landing.  The pilot reported that he circled prior to landing to wait for a rain shower to pass over the airport.  He reported the airplane touched down on the first 500 feet of runway and that it was not decelerating as usual during the landing roll.  The pilot reported there was more standing water on the runway than he had anticipated which resulted in ""almost zero braking capacity.""  The pilot reported he elected to continue the landing rather than attempt a go-around into the rising terrain off the departure end of the runway.  The pilot reported, ""I held the yoke full bake, pumped the brakes through several episodes of hydroplaning and concentrated on maintaining control of the aircraft, slowing it down, and steering it to the least damaging area of the overrun.""",Diminished braking action due to standing water on the runway.

The airplane was struck by a deer while landing.  The pilot reported that the passenger reported seeing a small deer off the right side of the runway when the airplane was in the landing flare.  The pilot reported that just prior to the nose touching down he heard a loud sound which he likened to a low frequency clunk.  He reported that he did not have any difficulty in controlling the airplane during the remainder of the landing.  The passenger reported to the pilot that she looked back and saw a deer climbing to its feet and running into the brush beside the runway.

The pilot was practicing a short field takeoff.  He held the brakes and set the engine to 2,650 revolutions per minute.  When he released the brakes, the airplane immediately veered to the left and departed the runway.  He attempted to apply full right rudder, but no right rudder was available.  He said that he attempted to control the airplane with differential braking.  The airport manager said that the airplane traveled approximately 350 feet, started down slope and struck an Elk fence (the fence was approximately 250 feet east of the runway).  The pilot said that the nose wheel dropped into a ditch which was along the left side of the runway.  The airplane's nose gear broke aft and the airplane came to rest in a nose down orientation.  Postaccident examination of the airplane by the pilot revealed that a headset on the floor of the airplane had jammed the rudder controls.",The pilot's inadequate airplane preflight inspection which led to the subsequent lateral control of the airplane on the ground not being possible.  A contributing factor was the unavailability of rudder control due to a headset blocking the rudder control mechanism during the takeoff roll.

The pilot stated that he had departed the Merced airport approximately 1400.  He climbed upwind until reaching an indicated altitude of 700 feet, and then began a left turn to 210 degrees for an on-course heading to Frazier Lake.  At this point, he began to feel a slight loss of engine power, followed by a slow reduction of engine power, which eventually reached a nearly wind milling condition.  He pumped the throttle, but the engine did not respond.  He attempted to return to the airport, but realized he was too far away to land on the runway.  He landed in a plowed field, where the airplane nosed over.  According to the pilot, the wing tanks were empty at the time of departure, and the only tank in use was the fuselage tank.  He stated that a possible cause of the engine failure was the use of a nonvented fuel tank cap.  A post accident examination of the engine revealed the only discrepancy was a nonvented fuel cap on the fuselage tank.  As fuel was being drained from the tank through the carburetor the drain flow ceased.  The fuselage fuel tank cap was removed, a vacuum sound was heard, and the drain flow began again.  The pilot stated he had switched the fuselage fuel tank cap prior to the last annual inspection that occurred 6 months and 8 hours prior to this flight.",The pilot's improper modification of the airplane when he switched a nonvented fuel cap to the fuselage tank.  A factor was the inadequate annual inspection.

The  Kawasaki Vertol KV-107 II rotorcraft had departed the helibase on a non-mandatory test flight requested by the pilot-in-command (PIC) to  'tweak' the rotorcraft's engine synchronization system.  The test flight was conducted with the bucket and 150 foot long line attached to facilitate the test procedure.  Witnesses reported observing the rotorcraft between 300 and 1,000 feet in altitude and beginning a climb when it began to pitch/roll and descend rapidly.  Several witnesses reported seeing the bucket horizontal to the rotorcraft and also caught up in one of the rotors.  The aircraft impacted on its right side intact with the exception of its rotor blades.  Two of the three forward rotor blades were found 600-900 feet from the ground impact site.  The third forward rotor blade, which was broken in half, was found with its outboard section at the ground impact site and the inboard half approximately 100 feet away.  All three aft rotor blades were found in close proximity to one another and approximately 400 feet distant from the primary ground impact site. All six blades separated from their root sections in about the same place and a post crash fire destroyed much of the rotorcraft.  Post crash examination established control continuity from the cockpit area through the control closet and on to all the associated hydraulic actuators as well as the continuity of the entire synchronization drive shafting.  Examination and disassembly of all major components revealed no evidence of any  fatigue propagation, disconnects, or characteristics of other time dependent failure mechanisms.  All hydraulic actuators underwent an X-ray examination and disassembly and there was no evidence of any blockage or jamming within any of the actuators.  The engines were examined and disassembled and the gas generator speed range for both was determined to be  between 64.3% and 69.7%, or about 10% above ground idle.   There was evidence that the long line cable encountered/impacted the nose gear strut, as well as an aft strut, the forward left side of the fuselage, the forward rotor head rain shield and all three forward rotor blades.  It could not be determined whether the cable to rotor interaction was an initiating event or the result of a previous occurrence which allowed the cable to become entangled with the forward rotor blades.  The PIC had more than 1630 hours of V-107 rotorcraft time of which more than 670 hours were logged as PIC time.  The co-pilot had more than 150 hours of V-107 rotorcraft time none of which was PIC time.",The loss of control during cruise/climb flight for undetermined reasons.

The private certificated pilot was departing a remote lake in a float-equipped airplane.  The lake is about 1,500 feet long, and is a location the pilot has operated from in the past.  The pilot said he taxied into the middle of the lake several times to check the wind conditions before takeoff.  The wind appeared to shift from the northwest, to the west, about 12 knots.  The pilot said he initiated one takeoff run, but aborted the takeoff.  His second takeoff included a step turn toward the south, during which the airplane seemed to lose a slight amount of speed.  The pilot decided to lower the flaps to assist in getting off the water and he reached for the flap handle.  The pilot said that as he reached for the handle, he realized he was reaching for the area of the airplane where the flap handle is normally installed in his other airplane, a Piper PA-18.  He was distracted by not finding the flap handle in the accident airplane. The airplane became airborne, but collided with the bank of the lake.  The airplane was then launched upward in a steep nose-up attitude, and the pilot said a stall was eminent.  He lowered the nose of the airplane, but the airplane rolled to the left, and collided with the ground.  The left float assembly, the left wing, and fuselage were damaged.",The pilot's delay in aborting the takeoff.  A factor in the accident was the pilot's diverted attention during the takeoff.

The private certificated pilot departed on a personal cross-country flight in a float-equipped experimental/homebuilt airplane.  The airplane was one of two airplanes headed for a remote lake.  The pilot said that during cruise flight about 2,300 feet msl, the engine lost power, decreasing from 2,350 to about 1,500 RPM.  She activated the engine boost pump, and the engine RPM increased, but then decreased again.  The pilot said she made several attempts to regain engine RPM by the use of the boost pump and engine throttle, but the engine quit.  The pilot selected a small lake for an emergency landing, but the airplane touched down in an area of soft, swampy terrain, about 50 yards short of the lake.  During the landing roll, the left wing collided with a tree, sustaining damage to the wing spar.

The airplane experienced a rough running engine 1/4 mile from the approach end of runway 33 (4,199 feet by 75 feet, concrete) at an altitude of 1,581 feet above the airport.   The pilot reported being too high and fast while landing on runway 33 with 20 degrees of flaps, so he executed a go around which was then followed by a total loss of engine power. The airplane landed in a dry corn field and came to rest inverted.  The private pilot had a total flight time of 119 hours.  The Flight Training Handbook cites techniques for performing an emergency landing and also states that the eagerness to get down is one of the most common faults of inexperienced pilots during simulated forced landings resulting in excessive speed to permit a safe landing.  Examination of the engine revealed an ingested exhaust valve from the number two cylinder.",the in-flight planning/decision and proper touchdown point not attained by the pilot.  Contributing factors were the ingested exhaust valve and lack of experience of the pilot.

As the airplane returned to the airport after a local flight at twilight, the pilot completed the landing checklist as the airplane approached the 45-degree leg.  The pilot intended to move the fuel selector handle from the right tip tank position, across two intermediate tank positions, to the left tip tank position.  The next position further to the left is the ""off"" position, which is guarded by a spring-loaded mechanical stop.  In the wreckage the mechanical stop was found attached to a plastic cover over the fuel selector; however, the cover was broken from the selector handle assembly.  Because of turbulent flight conditions, the pilot entered the downwind leg at the uncontrolled airport about 1,000 feet high and descended on extended downwind leg at near idle power.  When he advanced the throttle to arrest the airplane's descent on extended base leg, there was no response from the engine.  The fuel pressure read ""zero.""  He attempted to restart the engine and switched the fuel selector to another tank position; however, insufficient altitude remained to afford sufficient time to restart the engine.  The aircraft impacted a tree and crashed in the back yard of a residence, striking an occupant of the residence who was in the yard.  The morning after the accident there was no fuel in the fuel lines forward of the firewall; however, the aircraft had been inverted overnight.  About 2.5 ounces of fuel was found in the carburetor float bowl.  When the fuel selector handle was positioned between tanks, the investigation showed each of the adjacent ports was about 10-percent open.  Examination of the airplane revealed the annual inspection was 1-month overdue; however, it did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical failure.","The pilot's incorrect setting of the fuel selector valve during the prelanding checklist to a position between usable tanks, resulting in fuel starvation."

The commercial certificated pilot was back-taxiing on a runway in preparation for takeoff, and then began a 180 degree turn on the runway.  During the turn, the pilot said he heard a scraping sound, the airplane wobbled and shimmied, and the right brake was not functioning.  The right main landing gear strut collapsed near the axle attach point, and the right main wheel and tire rolled away from the airplane.  The right wingtip and the propeller struck the ground, and the right gear strut was torn loose from its upper attach point.  A postexamination of the right wheel and strut by the owner revealed the axle assembly separated from the lower end of the landing gear strut.  There are four hex head bolts utilized to secure the axle to the landing gear strut.  Each are inserted through the axle assembly and gear leg, and have a nut threaded and then torqued onto the bolt shaft.  All four of the bolts were bent.  Two of the nuts were stripped off their respective bolt shafts.  The remaining two bolts were broken about mid-shaft.  The owner of the airplane reported that about five days before the accident, new brake assemblies were installed on the airplane. The original bolts were re-used for the installation.  One of the broken bolts was submitted to the National Transportations Safety Board's Materials Laboratory for examination.  According to an NTSB materials engineer, the bolt was bent about 35 degrees, it had necking deformation adjacent to the fracture, and displayed features consistent with an overstress fracture in bending.","An overload failure of the main axle attaching bolts, and subsequent separation of the axle from the landing gear strut."

The airplane impacted a pole, trees, and terrain after takeoff.  The pilot said in a written statement, ""I began the takeoff at the extreme end of [runway] 25 (there was a little down hill start).  As I applied throttle I didn't notice the turbo charger kick in and wrote it off to the bumpy grass field.  Acceleration seemed a little sluggish but again attributed it to the grass field and being close to maximum gross weight (I normally fly out of Detroit City; this was my fourth departure from Arnold Field and my first from runway 25).  About 2/3 of the way down the runway I realized that there was a serious performance problem.  I rotated at a little over 60 knots and the wheels cleared the grass; I presumed the plane would then perform since I wouldn't have the retarding effect of the grass.  Looking up I could see power lines above me and realized that I would not clear them.  The plane continued to under perform; I pulled up on the yoke and the stall warning went off.  I lowered the nose and looked for a place I might get under the power lines and over the trees.  It was clear that that wouldn't happen and I lowered the nose and tried to aim for a thin spot in the tree line.  The right wing clipped a phone pole and we crashed through the trees, over the road and came to rest in a freshly plowed field.""  A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.  The airplane's engine was test run on the airframe.  The engine ran from idle to a power setting of 34 inches of manifold pressure.  Power was not increased beyond 34 inches due to safety concerns during the test.  During the test run, the magneto's were checked and the propeller was cycled.  No anomalies were noted during the test run.

The pilot descended from 5,500 feet to 1,500 feet, at a moderate cruise power setting, at 5,500 rpm.  About 1,500 feet above the ground, the two cycle 2-cylinder engine lost all power, and the pilot performed a forced landing to a field.  The pilot believed that the descent at cruise power created a lean fuel/air mixture.  Examination of the engine revealed scoring on both pistons, which was directly in line with the exhaust.  According to a representative from the engine manufacturer, that type of failure was indicative of a heat seizure, normally associated with an excessive exhaust gas temperature, exceeding 1200 degrees F.  The representative assumed that the engine was operating in a lean condition.  According to the manufacturer's engine manual, during cruise and descents, it was very important that to avoid creating a lean mixture condition with high rpm and low throttle opening.  Additionally, the manual warned that the engine was subject to sudden stoppage, and conformed to no aircraft standards.","The pilot's failure to follow the engine manufacturer's descent procedure, which resulted in a lean mixture condition and subsequent engine seizure."

He said he did not apply any carburetor heat, and the engine again lost power.  The pilot selected a forced landing area on a small, marshy lake.   After landing, he noticed leading edge damage on the left horizontal stabilizer.  He said the damage appeared to be the result of striking a tree limb during the emergency landing.  The pilot, who is also a certificated mechanic, said he replaced the entire leading edge of the stabilizer.  The pilot said that after the emergency landing, he did not find any obvious engine problem.  The wing fuel tanks contained about 1.5 to 2 inches of fuel, and the fuel screens and the fuel tank sumps were clean.  He said he suspected carburetor icing, or water in the fuel, as the engine problem.",A loss of engine power during cruise flight for an undertermined reason.

During refueling, with the airplane parked at the gate to unload passengers, a pressurized refueling hose broke loose from the airplane and a fire erupted.  The hose which broke loose was the inboard of two hoses which had been attached by the refueler to the left wing refueling panel.  Examination of the hose revealed that it came loose due to the fracture of the three refueling adapter ring locking lugs on the airplane's inboard left wing refueling port.  Metallurgical examination of the inboard (fractured) adapter and the outboard adapter indicated that although the inboard adapter had a different microstructure and probably a different heat treatment history from the outboard adapter, they both met the applicable requirements for ultimate tensile strength and chemistry.  Additionally, the metallurgical examination found the locking lug fractures to be the result of a one-time ductile overstress with no indications of preexisting cracking, corrosion, or defects that would have degraded the load-carrying capacity of the adapter.  Therefore, the failure of the adapter was the result of an overload applied at the time of the separation.  The investigation revealed that the refueler had improperly positioned the hydrant truck in relation to the airplane's left wing refueling panel prior to commencing refueling operations.  Because of this positioning, the lift platform's left railing obstructed the normal nozzle attachment procedure to the airplane's inboard manifold adapter.  Subsequently, while attaching the nozzle, the refueler improperly routed the hose over the top of the front railing, around the left forward corner support of the railing structure, and aft to the airplane's inboard manifold adapter ring.  The investigation also revealed evidence consistent with the refueler lowering the lift platform, for personal comfort during the long refueling, and the refueling hose then catching on the platform's left front railing and bumper.  Vertical pull tests indicated that the three nozzle attachment lugs were capable of supporting a load in excess of 10,000 pounds if the load was applied along the nozzle centerline.  However, the weight bearing capability of the lugs dropped off as the load was applied at increasing angles off the centerline.  At an angle of 30 degrees off centerline, the lugs failed below 1,000 pounds of load.  The refueler's improper routing of the fuel hose would have placed an off-axis load of approximately 52 degrees. The angular force applied to the manifold adapter ring was amplified when the refueling hose was pressurized.  The combination of the two forces resulted in the adapter ring's failure.  Pressurized fuel discharged forming a fuel mist cloud that subsequently ignited.  The resulting fire resulted in fatal injuries to the refueler.  The airplane's lower leading edge panels, the refueling control panel, and the outboard portions of the left engine fan cowl and thrust reverser were thermally damaged.  The hydrant truck was destroyed in the fire.  Since the accident, two companies have introduced modifications to help position hydrant dispenser trucks during single person operations, and industry groups are examining the need for changes to existing industry standards and practices of aircraft fueling.","the overstress fracture of the airplane's refueling adapter ring that resulted from the abnormal angular force applied to it.  The applied angular force occurred due to the ground refueler inadequately positioning the hydrant fuel truck (in relation to the airplane), and his inattentiveness while lowering the refueling lift platform, thus permitting the refueling hose to become snagged and pulled at an angle.  The fracture of the adapter ring during the refueling led to the ignition of the pressurized (mist producing) spilled fuel and subsequent fire."

After takeoff, the pilot reported ""an engine problem,"" but did not elaborate.  A witness on the ground saw that the left engine was trailing smoke, but the engine was still operating, and did not sound like it was ""missing"".   When asked by the tower controller if he required assistance, the pilot answered ""no"".  The controller cleared the pilot for left traffic to a landing, and provided the current weather.  There were no further transmissions from the pilot.  Smoothed radar tracking data revealed that the airplane turned toward a left downwind, and leveled off at 1,400 feet  msl (about 1,050 feet agl) and 156 knots.  During the next 14 seconds, the airplane descended to 1,100 feet and increased airspeed to 173 knots.  Then radar contact was lost.   Witnesses observed the airplane variously in a right snap roll and a left wingover, followed by a sharp dive to the ground.  The airplane had just undergone maintenance.  During maintenance, unused oil was found in the left engine cowling, which the pilot admitted he had previously spilled.  Following maintenance, the pilot was observed adding 3 additional quarts of oil to the left engine.  The engine oil dipsticks were calibrated on both sides, with each side pertaining to the oil level in a specific engine.  The side for the right engine was calibrated to read 1 3/4 quarts lower than the left engine.  The airplane's wreckage was fragmented.  No evidence of mechanical defect was found, nor was there any evidence of an extreme out-of-trim condition.  There was also no evidence of engine failure, detonation, or pre-impact failure.

The pilot and passenger departed on a fire patrol flight in the Cessna 172RG.  The pilot demonstrated basic flight techniques to the passenger and the aircraft proceeded into mountainous terrain.  While flying southeast up a canyon the aircraft's engine performance began deteriorating.  The pilot reported that about 10-15 seconds transpired between the time he initially noted the decrease in performance, to when the engine began to ""cough,"" and that the aircraft was approximately 1,000 feet above the ground and 200 feet horizontally from the rising terrain.  The aircraft impacted trees and terrain along the canyon's axis about 2,500 feet above sea level.  Although the average gradient from the crash site along the aircraft's direction of flight was more than +11 degrees over the 12,000 foot distance beyond the site, the aircraft had sufficient lateral distance to execute a 180 degree turn under normal power.  The pilot reported that he did not have time to exercise the carburetor heat when he began to troubleshoot.  He also reported that he had not encountered carburetor icing previously.  An examination of the aircraft at the accident site revealed the carburetor heat control in the ""OFF"" position.  Moderate carburetor icing conditions existed based on temperature/dew point extrapolation from a nearby weather reporting source, and the pilot reported a ragged overcast with bases at 4,000-5,000 feet and rain showers along the route of flight.

The airplane impacted terrain after striking trees and a power line in a residential area during initial climb from runway 27.  Recorded wind data from two weather observation stations reported  winds from 170 degrees at 14 knots gusting 17 knots and 200 degrees at 16 knots gusting 22 knots.  The pilot used a power setting of 35 inches of manifold pressure and a flap setting of 10 degrees for the takeoff configuration.  The only takeoff configurations cited in the pilot's operating handbook and checklists are with the use of  36 inches of manifold pressure and a flap setting of either 0 or 25 degrees.  There is no performance data within the pilot's operating handbook for flight configurations using 10 degrees of flaps.  A review of the airplane's weight and balance forms found a discrepancy in the empty weight values. The airplane's weight and balance forms were reviewed and Safety Board calculations indicated that the airplane had an empty weight of 2,357.57 pounds and a center of gravity of 79.9 inches, compared to an empty weight of 2,261.67 pounds and a CG of 83.3 inches listed in the latest revision forms. The pilot reported using a basic empty weight of 2,304 pounds and a CG of 83.3 inches in his weight and balance calculations.  The Safety Board calculated the weight and CG location for the accident flight as 3,490 pounds and 87 inches, respectively. The forward CG range for the accident airplane's weight was between 89 inches and 95 inches. Information about the effects of CG location and wind velocity on takeoff performance is available to pilots from the Federal Aviation Administration and commercial publications. Postaccident examination of the engine found evidence of some spark plug fouling, and camshaft and lifter body wear, although the negative effect of this wear on engine performance is not known because the proper short field takeoff procedures were not followed.

The accident aircraft, piloted by a solo student, was attempting to taxi onto runway 30 for takeoff behind a Horizon Air DHC-8 undergoing a maintenance engine run in a runup area on the northeast side of the approach end of runway 30.  The student pilot stated that after completing his preflight checklist, he waited, believing that the DHC-8 was about to take the runway for departure, but that when this did not happen he requested and received takeoff clearance for runway 30.  The tower controller did not issue any cautionary advisories for the DHC-8 activity to the student pilot with the takeoff clearance.  The student pilot reported that after starting toward the runway, ""I was more than half way past behind [sic] the Horizon plane, when they revved their engines.""  The propeller blast from the DHC-8 forced the accident aircraft to tip to the left and forward, causing it to strike its wingtip and propeller on the taxiway surface.  The aircraft continued to be buffeted by the propeller blast of the DHC-8 for several more minutes as the DHC-8 continued to do its engine run.  The tower was subsequently unable to reach the DHC-8 on the radio.  The DHC-8 crew, a pair of Horizon Air mechanics, continued its engine run until it was approached and signaled by an airport operations vehicle dispatched to the scene by the tower.  About this time, the tower re-established radio contact with the DHC-8 and instructed the DHC-8 crew to reduce engine power.  In interviews with an FAA inspector, the Horizon Air mechanics indicated they did not know how or why they lost radio contact with the tower.  FAA Order 7110.65N, ""Air Traffic Control"", instructs controllers to  ""Issue [wake turbulence] cautionary information [to include use of the words jet blast, propwash, or rotorwash] to any aircraft [including those on the airport movement area] if in your opinion, wake turbulence may have an adverse effect on it.""  However, Order 7110.65N further states that ""Because wake turbulence is unpredictable, the controller is not responsible for anticipating its existence or effect.""  A review of FAA Air Traffic Bulletins found no information on jet blast/prop blast hazards.","The DHC-8 maintenance crew's failure to maintain radio contact with the tower during its engine run.  Factors included the tower controller not issuing a safety advisory on the DHC-8 engine run to the accident pilot as recommended by FAA guidance, and the FAA's failure to make information on jet blast/prop blast hazards available to controllers."

Once the airplane was on the runway, the pilot advanced the throttle, the engine responded, and within 300 feet the airplane was airborne.  After tracking runway heading for about 1/2 mile, the pilot turned the airplane into the wind to improve climb performance.  ""Shortly"" after completing the turn, and while approximately 400 feet agl, the engine suddenly lost power.  The pilot lowered the nose to maintain airspeed, and executed a 180-degree turn to maneuver for a cornfield that was behind the airplane.  Because of  some power lines bordering the field, the pilot elected to proceed directly to it and land with a tailwind.  The pilot flew the airplane just above the field, trading airspeed to maintain altitude.  When the airplane started to stall, the pilot let it settle into the field.  The left wing contacted the corn, which was 10 feet tall.  The airplane's nose dropped, and the airplane impacted the ground nose low.  The airplane came to a stop upright, and both occupants exited.  The engine was from a 1986 Subaru that was involved in an automobile accident.  The engine had approximately 9,000 miles on it at the time of the automobile accident, and 93.6 flight hours in the accident airplane.

The pilot reported that he had never been into this airstrip before that was listed as a difficult approach, required advanced mountain skills and that instruction from an experienced mountain flying instructor should be obtained before landing there.  The approach is through a narrow mountain canyon, following a river and circling a conical peak.  The threshold to the airstrip is seen by the pilot about 1500 feet away.  If the approach is stable, the pilot then makes a right turn through an approximate 100-foot wide opening in the trees.  The pilot reported that when he made the right turn to final approach, the left wing was on the tree line and it was ""really tight."" The pilot increased the right banking turn, which put the aircraft on a collision course with the trees on the right side.  The pilot banked to the left but the aircraft felt ""sluggish.  The pilot added power and raised the nose of the aircraft to try and go-around, however, the stall horn sounded and the pilot knew that he was not going to avoid a collision with the trees.  The pilot then lowered the nose of the airplane, reduced power and leveled the wings.  The aircraft then collided with the trees and subsequently the ground.  The pilot reported that he had some mountain flying experience and that his passenger, a private pilot,  had been into this airstrip the week before.   The pilot reported no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the aircraft at the time of the accident.",The pilot's failure to attain proper alignment while on final approach and clearance from trees.

The airplane had departed the runway and was climbing at 90 knots when the engine/propeller rpm began to over speed.  The pilot attempted to adjust the propeller control; however, there was no change in rpm.  The airplane lost altitude and impacted trees near the departure end of the runway.  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the #6 connecting rod had failed, there was no oil present in the engine, and the oil filter converter plate was missing remnants of its gasket.  An Airworthiness Directive (AD) was issued that addressed the oil filter converter plate gasket on engines that had been factory remanufactured after April 1, 1999.  The AD required the replacement of the oil filter converter plate gasket before further flight on engines with more than 50 hours time since new, times since overhaul, or time since the last replacement of the gasket or converter plate, and thereafter every 50 hours time in service since the last replacement of the gasket.  Non compliance with the AD could result in the protruding or swelling of the converter plate gasket and subsequent loss of engine oil.  The engine had been factory remanufactured on May 5, 2000, and had accumulated approximately 376.2 hours since this remanufacture when the accident occurred.  Examination of the engine maintenance records revealed that the AD had not been complied with since the engine's remanufacture.","the mechanic's failure to perform an airworthiness directive, which resulted in the loss of engine oil through a partially failed oil filter converter plate gasket, and subsequent engine failure during takeoff climb.

The pilot said that the previous evening they had flown from Pontiac, Michigan, to Mackinac Island.  He said that he figured the people, baggage, and fuel for the trip and determined that there would be enough fuel to fly from Pontiac to Mackinac Island, and then from Mackinac Island to Pellston, Michigan.  The pilot said he planned to refuel at Pellston because they don't sell fuel at the Mackinac Island Airport.  He said that when he taxied out for departure from Mackinac Island, he had 12 gallons of fuel in each tank.  He said that Pellston was 10 minutes away.  After takeoff, the pilot contacted ARTCC and received vectors to the ILS approach for Pellston.  The weather at Pellston was ceilings of 800 broken, 1,500 overcast, 2-1/2 miles visibility with moderate rain.  While on the localizer, the pilot reported losing the localizer.  ARTCC provided vectors to the localizer.  The pilot informed the controller he was low on fuel.  The pilot intercepted the localizer and reported he was established on the approach.  Three minutes later, the pilot informed ARTCC he was missed approach.  The ARTCC controller asked the pilot what his intentions were.  The pilot said he was low on fuel and needed to get down, and requested if there was an airport nearby that had good visibility.  The controller provided weather information for several airports and a pilot report for Charlevoix.  After considering the options, the pilot elected to proceed to Charlevoix and then decided to go to Gaylord, Michigan.  Approximately 6 minutes later, the pilot reported losing an engine.

The pilot reported he was preparing to takeoff with a load of moose meat and a hunter from a remote gravel bar.  He checked the performance tables for takeoff in the short takeoff and landing (STOL) modified airplane, and calculated he would need approximately 500 feet to takeoff.  He estimated the length of the gravel bar as 600 feet.  In his report to the NTSB, the pilot said a ground witness indicated the prevailing wind shifted from an 8 to 10 knot  headwind into a 5 knot tailwind, just as the airplane became airborne at the end of the gravel bar.  The pilot said he was unable to keep the airplane in the air, and it settled into the water at the edge of the gravel bar and nosed over. He noted in his report that the accident could have been prevented by: ""Lighter loads and more of them. Closer attention to possible wind shear conditions.""","The pilot's inadequate preflight planning and preparation for takeoff from an off-airport, short field site.  Factors associated with the accident are a variable wind, and the pilot's inadequate weather evaluation."

The airplane had recently been repainted and was being ferried to another airport for complete refurbishing. The interior, including avionics and most of the instruments, had been removed. Prior to departure, the ATP-rated pilot drained both inboard wing tanks and drained no fuel.  He requested that 15 gallons of fuel be added to each side. The fuel was put in the inboard (auxiliary) fuel tanks, which have a fuel capacity of 15 gallons each.  No fuel was added to the outboard (main) fuel tanks, which have a fuel capacity of 40 gallons each.  Departure and the 20 minute en route flight were without reported incident.  Witnesses said the pilot had to abandon his initial landing approach to runway 34 due to conflicting traffic.  The pilot then turned downwind for runway 6, but the airplane descended below airport elevation (the airport is situated on top of a mesa).  Various witness accounts indicated one or both engines lost power. The airplane struck powerlines and impacted a downtown street.  Fuel selector valve handles were not found in the wreckage.  Upon opening both wings, the left and right fuel selector valves were found slightly misaligned from being centered on the left and right main tanks, respectively.  The fuel tanks were then drained.  Each auxiliary (inboard) tank contained 15 gallons of fuel.  Approximately 3 ounces of fuel were drained from the left main (outboard) tank.  No fuel drained from the right main tank.","total loss of engine power on both engines due to fuel starvation and the pilot's inability to access the available fuel supply.  Contributing factors were the pilot's inadequate supervision of the refueling operation, and his intentional operation of the airplane with known deficiencies in equipment (no fuel selector valve handles or placards installed)."

The crew was conducting a GPS instrument approach in a Douglas DC-6B airplane under IFR conditions.  Both pilots were certificated and type-rated in the Douglas DC-6B airplane.  The first pilot, seated in the right seat, was one of the company's senior check airman, and possessed a right seat dependency endorsement.  The second pilot, seated in the left seat, had less experience in the DC-6B airplane.  It had been previously agreed that the second pilot would fly the leg of the flight on which the accident occurred.  The first pilot reported that light snow showers were present, with visibility reported at 4 miles.  During final approach as the airplane passed over the airstrip threshold, a higher than normal sink rate was encountered.  He said that the initial touchdown was ""firm,"" but was thought to be within acceptable tolerances.  Just after touchdown, the left wing broke free from the airplane at the wing to fuselage attach point.  The airplane veered to the left, continued off the left side of the 5,000 feet long by 75 feet runway, down an embankment, and came to rest in an area of wet, tundra-covered terrain.

The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) revealed that as the airplane progressed along the approach, the first pilot says: ""You're only one mile from it....Take it on down ah three."" As the airplane passes over the runway threshold, the first pilot says: ""Keep that, keep that (expletive) power off.... Just push forward on the nose.""  The sound of impact is heard 4 seconds later.  The minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the approach is 400 feet msl (383 feet agl).  A contract weather observer reported lower ceilings, with about 1 mile visibility, over the approach end of the runway at the same time as the accident.","The flightcrew's continued use of an unstabilized GPS approach.

The aircraft went off of the left side of the runway during takeoff and nosed over.  The pilot said in a written report, ""I started the take off on the paved runway, which is 25 feet wide.  The airplane veered to the left shortly after the tail came up and although I was using full right rudder, I was not able to straighten the airplane out.  I got about a foot high and I was in a soybean field adjacent to runway 36.  I attempted to correct the direction but hit first the right wheel and then the left wheel.  When the left wheel hit, we ground looped. During the ground loop the airplane flipped over and the left wing was broken.  The ground is relatively level at the airport and the 25 foot wide paved runway is located in the center of the 3000 foot by 150 foot runway 18-36.""  The pilot listed no mechanical malfunctions or failures is his report.

After take-off, the pilot heard the engine ""pop"" followed by a loss of engine power, which resulted in a forced landing into trees.  Examination of the engine revealed that a newly installed factory remanufactured single-drive dual magneto had separated from the engine.  It had accumulated 17.9 hours at the time of the accident.  Examination of the magneto and the installed clamping blocks revealed that the mounting flanges on both sides of the distributor housing exhibited fatigue beach marks. Examination of the mounting flanges also revealed that there were two sets of contact marks. The smaller more linear inboard set of marks matched the contour of the installed magneto clamping blocks when tilted slightly.  These marks only penetrated slightly into the surface of the flanges.  The installed clamping blocks appeared to meet the shape and dimensional requirements of older style clamping blocks issued by the engine manufacturer.  The other marks were wider with curved ends that did not match any feature of the older style installed clamping blocks. A small step was apparent at the edge of the larger contact area indicating removal or displacement of material from the surface. The marks did however appear to match the configuration and shape for newer style clamping blocks introduced by the engine manufacturer on engines produced after March 1985.   According to the engine manufacturer, the change was instituted as a production product improvement and the use of the newer clamping blocks was not a mandatory requirement on the engine installed in this airplane.  According to the magneto manufacturer, the magneto housings are stripped of paint and dipped into a dichromate bath for corrosion prevention during the remanufacturing process.  They were subjected to an inspection for cracks, but the inspection was only visual.

During CFR Part 133 aero-logging operations in mountainous terrain, a loaded long-line became caught in some trees and separated from the helicopter. After the ground crew told the pilot what had happened, he began a hover over the site of the line separation, apparently to survey the situation. While in the hover, the pilot allowed the aircraft to move a short distance back and to the side. This put it into a position where its main rotor blades came in contact with a coniferous tree. Although the ground crew transmitted a warning to the pilot to power up and out of the trees, the rotor blades began coming apart before the pilot was able to take corrective action. Soon thereafter the helicopter collided with other trees, and fell to the ground in a nose down position.","The pilot's inadequate visual lookout which lead to his failure to maintain clearance from the nearby trees while in a high-hover. Factors include mountainous/hilly terrain, and tall trees in the area where the helicopter was hovering."

The airplane was damaged when the right main landing gear collapsed during landing.  A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right main landing gear air-oil shock absorber (oleo) was broken.  Further examination revealed that the end cap of the oleo was separated from the outer tube of the oleo.  The end cap was held in place by two bolts, 180 degrees apart, inserted radially through the outer tube.  The bolts were then threaded into the machined end cap.  The holes in the outer tube were elongated and torn out to the end of the tube.  Further examination revealed a second set of holes through the outer tube about 90 degrees to the first set of holes.  The second set of holes also revealed elongation of the holes.  According to the airplane owner, the right oleo was an original part.  The left strut had been replaced with a new strut since the airplane was manufactured in 1959.  According to the airplane type certificate holder, it is an approved repair procedure to rotate the outer tube of the oleo and drill a second set of holes when elongation of the first set is discovered.",The failure of the landing gear shock strut.

The helicopter was on approach to an offshore platform, turning from base to final at 300 feet, when the pilot heard the low rotor rpm audio warning, and then noticed that the low rotor rpm warning light was illuminated.  He initiated an autorotation and observed that the rotor rpm needle had dropped to zero.  The pilot stated that as the helicopter was descending, he noticed feedback in the flight controls and decided that a precautionary landing was necessary.  Subsequently, the pilot landed the helicopter in the water and shut down the engine.  During the main rotor coast down, the tail rotor contacted a five foot wave, resulting in separation of the tail rotor drive shaft.  The internal splines of the shaft and sleeve assembly of the rotor tachometer generator (part number 206-076-373-001) were found to be worn and not engaging.  The failure of the rotor tachometer generator splines resulted in a loss of hydraulic pressure to the helicopter flight controls, since the hydraulic pump is driven by the rotor tachometer generator.","the failure of the rotor tachometer generator, which resulted in a precautionary landing in the Gulf of Mexico.

The pilot reported he was landing on runway 07, and that prior to landing, the temporary tower gave him the winds as being from 100 degrees at 7 knots.  He stated the winds appeared to him to be fairly steady at these values throughout the approach.  The pilot reported that after touchdown with all three wheels on the asphalt and near the end of roll out, with yoke full back and aileron into the wind, the tail lifted and the aircraft yawed to the right.  The pilot stated he tried to correct with left rudder and brake, but  the tail lifted again and the aircraft yawed to the right much worse than the first time.  The aircraft's left main gear then collapsed.  The pilot reported that after he got out of the aircraft after the accident, ""I was facing looking down runway 07 and the wind was hitting me in the back of the neck.""  He stated that he then looked at the wind sock and estimated that the wind had changed to southwesterly at about 12 to 15 knots, and that soon afterward the tower was reporting winds from 190 degrees at 12 knots to other aircraft.  The pilot indicated on his NTSB accident report that no mechanical malfunction or failure was involved in the accident.  Reported winds at three observation stations in an area generally surrounding the accident airport exhibited variability in both direction and speed in a time frame starting about 1 1/2 hours after the accident.",The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions.

The floatplane sustained substantial damage on impact with water and a dock.  The pilot and six passengers were uninjured.  The pilot stated, ""Once I cleared the [obstacles] I put the ignition on, prop full, fuel on both, flaps 20 [degrees] and checked gear up, powered back to get a good rate of descent over [obstacles] so I would not eat up the length of the lake positioning to land. (smooth surface)  I came off the prop (as a brake) and began my round out higher than normal as I could feel an unusually high descent rate.  In a matter seconds I could tell something was wrong as I rounded out and needed more bank angle to increase my turn rate.  As I flared the plane continued to descend and the left float hit the water before I was ready and it hooked the plane immediately left about 45 [degrees] and then the rt float caught and began to slide sideways until we came to rest with the plane's tail up on the shore 90 [degrees] to the lake.  ... After a while of sitting there I realized the flaps never came down when I put the handle down.  The c/b [circuit breaker] was popped out.""  A witness stated, ""Just as here cleared the shoreline, the plane started to drop and bank hard to the left (or south).  For a short time I could not see the plane as it was blocked by the trees on the west bank.  When it came back into view it was heading south and practically on the water.  It seemed to come up short on the turn, kind of bounced a pontoon off the water or a dock causing the plane to rock.  When it rocked back to the left it appeared to hook or dip the left wing into the water or maybe a rock point causing the plane to spin to the left and sideways.  It hit the middle dock, which probably slowed it down and came to rest facing back to the east, resting in shallow water leaning to the right, propped up by the right wing.""  The airplane manual stated, ""A standby system can be used to operate the flaps in the event the primary system should malfunction.""","The pilot not maintaining the proper descent rate during the landing.

The pilot was maneuvering the agricultural airplane to enter a field and commence spraying, when at 120 feet agl, the engine lost power.  The pilot attempted to restart the engine; however, the engine did not restart.  During the ensuing forced landing, the airplane contacted circular rows of cotton, before coming to rest upright.  The engine was examined at the manufacturer's facility and silicon sealant was observed on the base flanges of the #1, #2, #4, and #6 cylinders and on the crankcase mating surfaces.  Fretting was observed on the base flanges of the cylinders, on the mating surface of the crankcase halves, and on the main bearing bosses.  The #2 main bearing was observed fragmented and the bearing's bore was cracked and damaged.  Additionally, it was observed that the crankshaft was fractured between the #2 main bearing and #3 crankshaft cheek.  According to a TCM metallurgist, the fatigue fracture's origin was determined to be at the aft radius of the #2 main bearing.  The silicon sealant prevented proper torqueing of the bolts that mate the crankcase halves and led to vibration at the crankcase mating surfaces.

The airplane was destroyed after an attempted landing following a reported partial power loss of the left engine while en route.  The flight did not divert to the closest airport located about 27 nautical miles to the southwest while at an altitude of about 15,900 feet.  This airport was a controlled field equipped with airport rescue and fire fighting (ARFF), and its longest runway was 9,005 feet.  The flight diverted to the departure airport located about 93 nautical miles to the north.  This airport was an uncontrolled field not equipped with ARFF, and its longest runway was 5,000 feet.  No emergency was declared.  

The airplane was reported by a witness to be too high and too fast to land on runway 34 at the airport.  The winds were from 140 degrees at 6 knots.  The wreckage distribution was consistent with an impact resulting from a Vmc (minimum control speed with the critical engine inoperative) roll to the left.  

The pilot received a checkout from the right seat in the accident airplane by the airplane owner.  The checkout was about 20 minutes in duration and did not include any single-engine flight maneuvers or emergency procedures.  The owner did not hold a certified flight instructor certificate.  The pilot had stopped flying for 12 years and just began giving flight instruction and flying in single-engine airplanes about a year prior to the accident.  The pilot's recent multiengine flight experience was limited to a couple of non-revenue flights within the past year while seated in the right seat of a King Air.  The King Air was used for commercial charter work which would involve one or two landings per flight.  One landing was made on the day prior to the accident.  The accident pilot asked the King Air pilot to accompany him along on the accident flight; the King Air pilot declined.  A multiengine commercial rated pilot-rated passenger, who the accident pilot knew, was seated in the right front seat.  

Examination of the airplane's supplemental type certificate (STC) revealed that the airplane had undergone numerous inspections by different maintenance personnel.  The left engine's variable absolute pressure controller had safety wire around its control arm, which precluded its normal operation and a pressure relief valve that was not called for in the STC drawings.  At the time of issuance, Federal Regulation's did not require STC instructions for continued airworthiness.  Reliance on the airplane and engine maintenance manuals would not have provided enough information for continued airworthiness in accordance with the STC and could have yielded a setting exceeding those for which the STC parts were originally certificated to and thus increasing Vmc speed.

Examination of the left engine revealed a cylinder head separation on the number six cylinder assembly, which had accumulated an estimated time since installation of 240 hours.  Visual inspection of the assembly revealed the presence of some undecipherable characters in its parts numbering.  A cylinder head separation from another airplane was also examined.  This cylinder assembly accumulated about 270 hours since installation.  Both cylinder assembly examinations revealed the presence of additional material on the cylinder barrel threads and fatigue fracture on the cylinder head.","The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed (Vmc) which resulted in a loss of control.   Contributing factors were the improper in-flight planning/decision not to land at a closer airport and the lack of recent experience in multiengine airplanes by the pilot-in-command, the cylinder head separation, the inadequate manufacturing process, and the lack of continued airworthiness instructions relating to the Riley Super-8 STC."

The glider contacted the runway during takeoff.  The pilot reported that approximately 200 feet into the ground run, the glider became airborne.  After reaching an altitude of about 5 feet, the glider settled to the runway and bounced.  The pilot reported that he was wearing headphones, which slipped forward when the glider contacted the runway.  As the headphones slipped forward, the pilot's hat was pulled down over his eyes.  The glider became airborne again and because he was unable to see the tow plane, the pilot released the glider from the tow.  The glider impacted hard on the runway and the pilot suffered a compression fracture in his back.",The pilot's  decision to release from the tow plane during the takeoff.  A factor associated with the accident was the pilot's vision was restricted by his hat during the takeoff.

The pilot received a weather briefing and when they launched the balloon, the wind was as reported during the briefing.  Approximately 30 minutes into the flight, the wind speed had increased.  The pilot told his passenger that they were going to conduct a ""lay down landing,"" and he briefed her on the proper landing position.  The pilot was attempting to land in a field when both he and his passenger saw a fence in their flight path that they ""had not seen before.""  The pilot attempted to slow the descent; however, they were too close, and the balloon basket impacted the fence.  The passenger was thrown forward against the other side of the basket where she impacted and broke her arm.  The balloon subsequently impacted the ground and drug approximately 300 feet before coming to a stop.  The passenger reported that she had flown with the pilot on numerous occasions and was familiar with the balloon.  She knew they were going to hit the fence; however, she ""must not have been holding on tight enough"" since she was thrown to the opposite side of the balloon basket.",the pilot's failure to maintain clearance with the fence while landing.

The pilot approached a mountain ridge at a 45-degree angle, ""at the same altitude as the ridge.""  As he flew closer to the ridge, the airplane experienced a ""modest downdraft,"" and the pilot added power to maintain his altitude.  When the pilot noticed that he would not be able to climb over the ridge, he turned the airplane back toward the valley to regain altitude.  During the turn, the airplane experienced a ""substantial downdraft combined with windshear.""  The pilot added full power; however, the airplane's altitude continued to decrease at about 2,500 feet per minute, and the airplane impacted trees.  The pilot reported no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane.  The winds reported at an airport 5 miles away were from 330 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 15 knots.","The pilot's failure to maintain sufficient altitude/clearance, which resulted in the airplane's collision with terrain.

The pilot made a mayday call, shut off the fuel valve, and performed an autorotation into high grass after the single engine helicopter experienced a loss of engine power shortly after takeoff.  The pilot had heard a bang followed by illumination of the engine out warning light, and the engine began smoking.  During the terminal phase of the autorotation, the pilot assumed the grass height was 3 feet and flared accordingly; however, the grass was at least 6 feet tall.  Post-accident examination of the engine revealed that the No. 1 turbine wheel was missing.  The No. 8 bearing thrust nut exhibited a locking indentation and a notch on its inside surface.  Additionally, indentations were on the threads of the threaded end of the first stage turbine wheel shaft.  These marks suggest that the thrust nut was not fully engaged on the first stage turbine shaft.  The location of the notch suggests that the edge of the nut protruded beyond the end of the turbine shaft.  There were no indications of contact by the shaft threads on the inner surface of the deformed area to suggest that it had been displaced into a groove on the first stage turbine shaft.  Review of the maintenance records and interviews with the mechanic, who performed the most recent maintenance work, revealed that the turbine section had been replaced approximately 30 hours prior to the accident.  Due to excessive oil consumption, maintenance personnel removed the turbine and replaced the No. 5 carbon seal approximately 14 hours prior to the accident.  The maintenance records indicated that the day before the accident, the sump cover had been removed for trouble shooting oil consumption.  Though it is not detailed in the maintenance entry, it is interpreted that the ""sump cover"" referred to is the No. 8 Bearing sump nut since the thrust nut was loose.","The failure of the mechanic to secure the No. 8 bearing thrust nut during maintenance work, which resulted in the total failure of the first stage turbine wheel shaft.  Also causal was his misjudgment of his height during the flare resulting in a hard landing.   A contributing factor was the high vegetation in the forced landing field, which resulted in a hard landing."

After the pilot made a normal-sounding base turn call for runway 34 on the airport's common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF), the airplane was observed by witnesses to experience a nose drop and crash into a cattle pasture about 3/4 mile short of the runway.  On-site examination disclosed wreckage and impact signatures consistent with an uncontrolled, right wing low, relatively low-speed impact, as well as physical and instrument evidence of a left engine power loss.  However, the aircraft's left propeller was not feathered, and gear and flaps were found to be fully extended at the time of impact.  The reason for the left engine power loss was not determined; however, the following findings potentially related to left engine performance were noted:  both engines were approximately 300 hours past the manufacturer's recommended time between overhauls (TBO), evidence of improper idle mixture and idle stop adjustments to the left engine by maintenance personnel was discovered during post-accident fuel system component testing (a work order, dated the day before the accident but without any corresponding aircraft or engine logbook entries, further indicated that ""MIXTURE IDLE CUTOFF"" and ""FUEL PRESSURE"" had been adjusted on both engines), and the left side fuel selector was found in the AUX position (the aircraft owner's handbook specifies the MAIN position for descent and landing.)  Post-accident testing demonstrated that the left propeller feathered quickly and smoothly when oil pressure was removed from the hub, and that the left propeller governor would cut oil pressure to the hub.","The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed following a loss of power on the left engine, resulting in loss of aircraft control.  Factors included a loss of power on the left engine for undetermined reasons, and the pilot's failure to properly configure the airplane for the engine-out condition."

The pilot departed on a local close traffic glider flight.  After climbing above the traffic pattern altitude of 1,200 feet agl, he released from the tow-plane.  Once free, he maneuvered the glider onto the downwind for runway 2, and radioed his position and intentions. He turned base approximately 700 feet agl, and made another radio announcement.  About 500 feet agl, the pilot turned final and recalls having a good ""angle"" to his aiming point.  About 150 to 200 feet from the aiming point and 10 feet agl, the indicated airspeed was approximately 50 knots.  The pilot then shifted his attention outside the glider for the final phase of the landing.  When the glider was about 3 feet agl and ""near"" the flare point, it started to drop ""sharply.""  The glider touched down hard nose first, and then bounced back into the air.  The pilot was able to maintain directional control while the glider made several more bounces before rolling out and coming to a stop.  He then exited the airplane under his own power.

The engine start, taxi, and run-up seemed normal.  The pilot then tookoff on runway 09, a 1,800-foot long, 50-foot wide turf runway.  About 50 feet above the ground, the engine lost partial power, and the pilot lowered the nose of the airplane.  He then turned right to avoid tree stumps, and the airplane impacted in a soybean field, located off the right side of the runway.  The pilot added that within the 60-day period prior to the accident, on two occasions, he had difficulty priming the engine.   However, after each occurrence, the fittings and primer hose appeared normal.  The airport manager examined the airplane after the accident.  He observed that the primer hose, which connected the fuel primer to both carburetors, was loose.  The manager could not be certain if it was loose before the impact, or if the impact loosened the hose.  A Federal Aviation Administration inspector examined the engine.  He was able to rotate the propeller by hand, and attain thumb compression on both cylinders.  The inspector observed fuel in the fuel bowl, it appeared similar to automotive gasoline, and was absent of contamination.  Due to safety concerns, the inspector did not attempt to check the spark plugs.",A partial power loss for undetermined reasons.

The student pilot/builder of the glider made five successful tow releases and landings from a paved runway, and was making his first tow release from grass.  The driver towed the glider to the starting point, the student pilot got onboard, and he and another individual installed the canopy.  The student pilot/builder checked the security of the canopy with a ""push-up"" on it, then began the glider tow.   At liftoff, about 38 knots, the glider hit a clump of grass, and the canopy departed the airframe.  The student pilot raised his left arm to protect his face, and thought he must have pulled back on the control stick as he avoided the canopy.  The glider stalled about 10 feet in the air, then hit the ground.  The student pilot/builder had difficulty latching the canopy prior to previous tows, and felt that the latching mechanism may have been twisted.","An improperly secured canopy latch, which resulted in canopy separation during liftoff and the pilot's subsequent loss of control.

While on final approach to the runway the captain received an unsafe nose landing gear indication on the multi function display unit (MFDU) in the cockpit.  The captain abandoned the approach and ""recycled the gear per procedures to no avail.""  Subsequently, the airplane landed on runway 13R, rolled out, and came to a stop on the runway.  An evacuation of the airplane was not initiated.  A maintenance crew met the airplane on the runway and placed locking pins in the gear.  Multiple simultaneous communications/conversations ensued between the maintenance crew, a maintenance supervisor, a maintenance crew chief and the flight crew.  During the communications, the flight crew questioned maintenance personnel on whether or not it was necessary to strap the gear, the supervisor searched the maintenance manuals and didn't find any reference to strapping the gear, and informed the maintenance crew that it was not necessary to strap the gear prior to towing.  Review of the maintenance manual found numerous warnings regarding towing the airplane with an unsafe nose landing gear indication.  Meanwhile, a maintenance crew chief was informing the maintenance personnel that strapping of the gear was required; however, there was no strap at the airport.  Despite a placard, located on the nose landing gear door, the maintenance crew attempted to tow the airplane without strapping the nose landing gear.  Subsequently, the nose landing gear collapsed and the nose of the airplane came to rest on the towbar.  The passengers were then deplaned and transported to the terminal by a bus.  Examination of the nose landing gear did not reveal the reason for the down-lock plunger to engage when the nose landing gear was extended.","The collapse of the nose landing gear as a result of the failure of company maintenance personnel to follow the proper procedures for a towing the airplane with an unsafe nose landing gear indication.  Contributing factors were the inadequate communication between the company maintenance personnel, the inaccurate instructions provided to the maintenance crew, and the failure of the nose landing gear's locking mechanism."

The flight was for the purposes of,  (1) pre purchase aircraft checkout, and (2) pilot checkout. Following some local area air work, the prospective buyer in the left seat and the seller/CFI/check pilot in the right seat, entered the traffic pattern for practice landings. Following two normal landings by the left seat occupant, the CFI pulled the left throttle back for a simulated single engine approach and landing. The pattern and approach were executed normally until about 10 to 15 feet agl, over the runway , when the CFI stated, ""Let's go around"". The throttles were advanced, ( ""probably too quickly"", according to the CFI) but the left engine did not respond. The aircraft yawed and banked left, dragged the left wingtip on the runway, and cart wheeled into the airport's grassy infield. Subsequent examination of the engines by an FAA inspector revealed no discrepancies.","The failure of the CFI/check pilot to insure Vmc was maintained during a go-around following a simulated failed engine approach, resulting in an in-flight loss of control, uncontrolled descent, and collision with the terrain.

The pilot completed a preflight inspection of the glider, including the cockpit area.  After a tow release at 3,000 feet msl, the pilot flew for about 1 hour.  To descend, the pilot completed a spin to the right.  He then induced a spin to the left, and heard a loud bang when an object struck the inside of the canopy.  Then pilot then saw the object float forward and settle into the area where the rudder pedals were located.  As he tried to apply opposite rudder, he felt a binding in the pedals.  He had sufficient rudder authority to stop the spin's rotation; however, the airplane's dive angle and airspeed had increased significantly.  The pilot ""pulled back fairly hard"" on the control stick, and as the airspeed climbed to 100-110 knots, he recovered the glider.  The object that became entangled in the rudder pedals was subsequently identified as a transformer used for charging the glider's battery.  The transformer was not normally used in the glider for recharging.  It had been borrowed from another club member, and ""someone"" had used it to charge the battery via a long extension cord.  The battery would have normally been disconnected, and put on a small transformer/charger in the club office.","The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection, which resulted in a loose battery charger becoming entangled in the rudder pedals during a spin recovery, and a subsequent overstress of the glider.

While maneuvering during a local instructional flight, the multiengine airplane entered a flat spin that resulted in an in-flight collision with the terrain. A witness, who holds a private pilot certificate, observed the airplane approximately 1,500 feet agl in a ""flat spin,"" and the airplane impacted the ground ""flat on its bottom"" in a pasture, approximately 400 yards north of the witness.  Another witness reported that the airplane was in a flat spin and could not recover.  The private pilot with a multiengine rating occupied the left seat, and the multiengine flight instructor occupied the right seat.  At the accident site, the landing gear actuator was found in the extended position, and the flap actuators were found in the 10 degree flap position.  Examination of the right propeller revealed that the blade counterweight signature markings on the blade sockets indicated that the propeller was in the feathered position at impact.  Examination of the right propeller unfeathering accumulator revealed the presence of three separate cracks at the transition between the circumferential stiffener and the thin-walled hemisphere of the diaphragm.  The private pilot's toxicological tests indicated that 0.462 (ug/ml, ug/g) of Citalopram (also known by the trade name Celexa), 0.114 (ug/ml, ug/g) of N-desmethylcitapram, 0.024 (ug/ml, ug/g) of di-N-desmethylcitalopram, 0.194 (ug/ml, ug/g) of Diphenhydramine (commonly known by the trade name Benadryl) was detected in the blood and urine, and 17.406 (ug/ml, ug/g) acetaminophen was detected in the urine.  Citalopram is a prescription antidepressant, N-desmethylcitapram and di-N-desmethylcitalopram are metabolites of citalopram, and diphenhydramine is an over-the counter antihistamine with sedative effects, often used to treat allergy symptoms.  Diphenhydramine was detected in the private pilot's blood in levels consistent with the recent ingestion of several times a normal dose, and the pilot was likely impaired by the effects of diphenhydramine.",The inadvertent flat spin of the airplane by the flightcrew resulting from the flight instructor's inadequate supervision.  A contributing factor was the impairment (drugs) of the private pilot.

The pilot had indicated to family members that he was repositioning the airplane from a grass airstrip where the airplane had been stuck in mud to a paved airport.  The pilot indicated that he was aware of rain in the area and would be trying to move the airplane before the rain began.  The owner of the grass airstrip stated that just before the airplane departed, it was raining ""heavily,"" and he had told the pilot not to fly due to the wind and rain.  The owner of the airstrip then witnessed the pilot get into the airplane, taxi to the north end of the airstrip, and takeoff toward the south.  One witness, who was in a building adjacent to the airstrip, observed the airplane takeoff.  He stated that he ""could not believe that the airplane was taking off in the driving rain.""  Two witnesses reported that the airplane entered a ""sharp"" left turn and, subsequently, impacted an open field.  One witness stated that ""the aircraft appeared to stall,"" and that the accident occurred during a thunderstorm.  Radar summary images revealed that a Level 3/4 thunderstorm, and possibly a Level 5  thunderstorm, were in the vicinity the airstrip at the time of the accident.  Review of medical records revealed that the pilot did not possess a current medical certificate.  On the pilot's last aviation medical examination, dated 09/20/2001, he was noted to have a history of diabetes (with fasting blood sugars between 100 and 132) on oral medications, high blood pressure controlled on medication, and diverticulitis treated with Clindex (clidinium/chlordiazepoxide).

Just after the pilot entered the aerobatic box in his experimental One Design aircraft, the airplane developed an ""extreme vibration."" The pilot therefore shut the engine off and began a glide toward a nearby road. During the descent, with the propeller windmilling, the aircraft shook so violently that it was very difficult for the pilot to see, and he became concerned that the engine might separate from the airframe. When the aircraft reached the ground, the pilot tried to land on a narrow road, but with his visibility still significantly effected by the vibration of the airframe, he was unable to keep the One Design within the lateral confines of the road. During the landing roll, one of the main wheels departed the side of the road and encountered soft terrain. The main gear wheel then began to sink into the soft terrain, and the aircraft nosed over onto its back. It was later determined that one of the propeller counterweight mounting brackets (along with the counterweight itself) had separated from the propeller. A post-accident inspection of the counterweight on the apposing blade revealed that one of its mounting bolts was under-torqued approximately 115 inch-pounds below the value listed in the associated assembly torque table. The propeller, which was a non-certified model with composite blades, had been loaned to the pilot by the manufacturer, while his propeller was undergoing a periodic inspection.","the separation of a propeller counterweight mounting bracket due to incorrect mounting bolt torque. Factors include significant powerplant vibration during the forced landing, no suitable landing area, and soft terrain next to the narrow road on which the pilot attempted his emergency landing."

The airplane departed the right side of runway 35 and struck a berm while landing.  In a written statement, the pilot said that a, ""... sudden unexpected wind gust pushed and lifted [his] aircraft off runway 36.  [The] aircraft came back down on the muddy edge, with the nose pointed northeast.  Attempts to direct aircraft back towards the runway produced a skid, allowing the aircraft to continue in a northeasterly direction.  Upon seeing the berm directly in front of the aircraft, I pulled back hard on the [yoke] and [applied] full left rudder.  The aircraft gear (nose and left wheel) hit the top of the berm; the aircraft turned 180 degrees and came to rest. ... Two previous attempts at landing on 27 with go arounds indicated strong winds with varying direction...""  The pilot listed no mechanical malfunction in his report of the accident.

The pilot said their gas balloon was cruising at 3,000 feet agl over the Liberal, Kansas, area when they experienced a microburst.  The pilot said they suddenly found themselves heading for the ground at a very high rate of descent.  The pilot said they dropped ballast to try and slow their descent.  He said he then saw that his angle of descent was going to take the balloon into power lines along a road.  The pilot said he opened the vent and put the basket on the road.  The envelope went into the power lines, tore open, caught fire, and burned.  At the time of the accident the aviation routine weather report for Dodge City, Kansas, 60 miles northeast of the accident site, reported clear skies, 10 miles visibility, and winds of 180 degrees at 19 knots with gusts to 25 knots.  The report also stated in the remarks that peak winds of 31 knots were recorded at 1600.  The balloon was part of a gas balloon race associated with the annual Albuquerque Balloon Festival in which the contestants try to cover the farthest distance within a three day period.","The pilot's inadvertent flight into adverse weather conditions during cruise flight and the unsuitable landing area encountered during the uncontrolled descent.

While en route on a positioning flight in dark night visual meteorological conditions, the Emergency Medical Service twin-engine helicopter was diverted to pick up a patient who was involved in an automobile accident.  Upon arriving in the vicinity of the accident, the pilot had trouble locating the accident site.  After circling the area several times, the pilot was informed that the patient was transported by ground vehicle.  The flight departed the area for the initial intended destination.  The pilot  filed a company flight plan with an estimated time of arrival of 30 minutes and 40 minutes of fuel on board.  About 10 minutes from destination, both of the helicopter's engines lost power, and the pilot initiated an autorotation.  The pilot spotted what he believed to be a tree or bush and ""flared a little high to miss the obstacle which caused a decrease in rotor rpm.""  During the landing, the helicopter touched down ""hard,"" slid approximately 30-40 feet, before coming to rest on its left side following the separation of both landing skid tubes.  Examination of the helicopter revealed that the fuel system was not compromised.   During the examination of the fuel system, a total of 2 ounces of fuel was drained from both fuel filters and the fuel lines, which lead to the fuel nozzles.  A total of 2 quarts of fuel was drained from both fuel tanks.  Toxicology testing of the pilot was positive for methamphetamine (>20000 ng/ml) and amphetamine (2642 ng/ml).  The operator reported that ""the pilot admitted to taking medicine prescribed for his wife, and was taking this medicine for 3 days prior to the accident.""","The pilots impairment due to drugs.

The noninstrument rated pilot reported that he received a weather briefing and that visual flight rules (VFR) conditions prevailed at his destination, 31 miles to the southeast.  It was a dark, moonless, night but stars were visible in the sky at the departure airport with haze to the west.  Lights were visible 10 miles to the south.  The pilot departed on runway 29 and made a right, downwind departure.  During the departure turn, he encountered instrument meteorological conditions at about 900 feet.  He reported that while in the clouds he had difficulty leveling the wings and there was ""some altitude fluctuation.""  During this time there was a ""pop"" sound and the aircraft became difficult to control.  He broke out on top of the clouds at 2,700 feet and proceeded to landing at his original destination.  Control of the aircraft required him to input full right rudder control, 90 percent of available right aileron control, and to reduce power on the right engine.  Inspection of the left wing revealed damage to the outboard 5 feet of the wing leading edge and embedded tree debris.","The pilot's inadvertent (dark, nighttime) VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions and subsequent loss of altitude control.

The airplane was parked outside on the ramp the night before the accident and was subjected to rain, snow, and temperatures that dropped below 32 degrees F.  Other pilots whose airplanes were also parked outside overnight stated that about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of snow/frost covered a layer of ice on their airplanes the morning of the accident.  Because of these conditions, ramp personnel deiced the accident airplane with a heated mixture of glycol and water.  The PenAir ramp supervisor who conducted the deicing stated that he believed the upper surface of the wing was clear of ice but that he did not physically touch the wing to check for the presence of ice.  Investigators were unable to determine whether the accident pilot visually or physically checked the wing and tail surfaces for contamination after the accident airplane was deiced.  However, the airplane's high-wing configuration would have hindered the pilot's ability to see residual clear ice on the surface of the wing after the deicing procedures.  Company records indicate that the certificated commercial pilot completed his initial CE-208 flight training 2 months before the accident and had accumulated a total of 74 hours in this make and model of airplane.  The airplane, with the pilot and nine passengers onboard, crashed shortly after takeoff from runway 01.  A witness observed that the airplane's flight appeared to be normal until the airplane suddenly pitched up, rolled 90 degrees to the left, and yawed to the left.  The airplane then descended nose-down until it disappeared from view.  Data from the engine monitoring system revealed that the maximum altitude obtained during the accident flight was about 651 feet mean sea level.  The airplane crashed in a level attitude.  Investigators found no evidence of pre-impact failures in the structure, flight control systems, or instruments.  Further, examination of the engine and propeller revealed no pre-impact failures and that the engine was running when the airplane hit the ground.",an in-flight loss of control resulting from upper surface ice contamination that the pilot-in-command failed to detect during his preflight inspection of the airplane.  Contributing to the accident was the lack of a preflight inspection requirement for CE-208 pilots to examine at close range the upper surface of the wing for ice contamination when ground icing conditions exist.

The flight crew experienced a jammed horizontal stabilizer trim actuator during the takeoff initial climb.  The pilot reported that after takeoff, during climb out, the ""STAB OUT OF TRIM"" annunciator light illuminated.  The crew disengaged the autopilot and found the electric trim control inoperative at both the pilot and co-pilot positions, and the manual trim control was jammed and immovable.  The crew leveled the airplane at 13,000 feet and accomplished the ""Stabilizer Out of Trim"" and ""Jammed Stabilizer"" checklists to no avail.  The crew declared an emergency with air traffic control, and made an otherwise uneventful landing at Los Angeles.  According to the pilot, the trim manual control was jammed and immobile.  Post flight examination revealed the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator motor was seized.  The actuator motor was subsequently replaced with a serviceable unit, and the aircraft was ferried to Seattle for inspection.  No other faults were found in the pitch trim system and the airplane was returned to service.  Further examination of the actuator motor revealed that the motor was mechanically seized.   According to a representative of Boeing Aircraft Company, with the motor seized, in order to manually trim the stabilizer, it would have been necessary for the flight crew to exert sufficient force on the trim wheel to cause the motor clutch to slip in addition to the force necessary to overcome normal system friction.",The failure of the stabilizer electric trim motor as a result of internal mechanical seizure.

The airplane collided with an airport boundary fence during an aborted landing.  The pilot made a normal approach following the visual approach slope indicator (VASI) with gear down and full flaps and touched down just past the numbers and began to decelerate.  The pilot selected reverse thrust with both engines.  As he added power to decelerate, the airplane suddenly veered to the left and off the runway when the right engine did not go into reverse thrust.  He deselected reverse thrust and aligned the airplane with the runway.  He was approaching the end of the runway at high speed and elected to attempt a takeoff.  The airplane went off the end of the runway onto smooth grass.  The pilot rotated the airplane, but the airplane collided with an airport boundary fence and came to rest in a field.  In a post accident examination, when the power levers were placed in the full reverse position, the left fuel control measured 4 degrees, while the right measured 0 degrees.  The left pitch control measured 10 degrees, while the right measured 0 degrees; the controls should have read 0 degrees.  A controls engineer determined that during landing, there would be a 10-degree propeller pitch control (PPC) angle mismatch, which would be about 2.5 degrees of BETA angle.  With matched levers, there would be asymmetric reverse thrust with the left engine lower in torque.  This would result in the airplane turning towards the left if both propellers had gone into reverse pitch.",a misrigging of the engine controls that resulted in an asymmetric reverse thrust condition.

During the takeoff roll, the pilot over-rotated, causing the aircraft's tail cone to strike the runway surface. He then maintained this excessive pitch attitude as the aircraft continued to roll down the runway. The pilot eventually became convinced that he would not be able to ensure a safe takeoff if he continued. He therefore aborted the takeoff. During the abort, he allowed the aircraft to drift to the side of the runway, where one of the main gear encountered soft terrain. After encountering the soft terrain, the aircraft veered off the side of the runway surface, where the nose wheel encountered soft/wet terrain conditions.

The captain and first officer were conducting a localizer DME back course approach to runway 36 in a twin-engine turboprop airplane during a night cargo flight under IFR conditions.  The minimum visibility for the approach was one mile, and the minimum descent altitude (MDA) was 460 feet msl (338 feet agl).  Prior to leaving their cruise altitude, the first officer listened to the ATIS information which included an altimeter setting of 29.30 inHg.  No other altimeter information was received until the crew reported they were inbound on the approach. At that time, tower personnel told the crew that the visibility was one mile in light snow, the wind was from 040 degrees at 22 knots, and the altimeter setting was 29.22 inHg. The crew did not reset the airplane altimeters from 29.30 to 29.22.  At the final approach fix (5 miles from the runway), the captain began a descent to the MDA.  Thirty-six seconds before impact, the first officer cautioned the captain about the airplane's high airspeed.  Due to strong crosswinds, the captain disconnected the autopilot 22 seconds before impact.  He said he pushed the altitude hold feature on the flight director at the MDA.  Eighteen seconds before impact, the airplane leveled off about 471 feet indicated altitude, but then descended again 9 seconds later.  The descent continued until the airplane collided with the ground, 3.5 miles from the runway.  The crew said that neither the airport, or the snow-covered terrain, was observed before impact.  The crew reported that the landing lights were off. The airplane was not equipped with a ground proximity warning system.","The captain's continued descent below the minimum descent altitude which resulted in impact with terrain during an instrument landing approach.

The captain briefed a ""no go-around"" for a night visual approach to a ""Special Airport.""  The approach was not stabilized, and the airspeed decreased to the point of a stall.  The airplane struck the runway in a nose high pitch attitude, on the aft fuselage, and settled on the landing gear.  The first officer made initial callouts of slow airspeed and then stopped when the captain failed to respond to her callouts.  After landing, the airplane was taxied to the gate where a post flight inspection limited to the main landing gear did not find the damage.  When interviewed, the captain reported that she briefed ""no go-around"" because no takeoffs were authorized on the runway at night or in IMC conditions; however, the first officer knew this was incorrect, but did not challenge the captain.  Both pilots had received CRM training, which included crewmember assertiveness, methods of fostering crew input, and situational awareness, and training on special use airports; however it was not followed by either pilot.  The captain's handling of the airplane was outside the parameters specified in the company manuals.  Both pilots were described to having good flying skills.

During a visual flight rules (VFR) cross country flight, the student pilot encountered, and intentionally entered, instrument meteorological conditions. Although his passenger requested that he turn around, the pilot elected to attempt to reach his intended destination. Eventually the flight encountered a squall line with its associated rain, clouds, mist, and high winds. When he thought he was in the vicinity of the destination airport, the pilot, who was navigating primarily with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS), descended to just under the clouds. While maneuvering under very low ceiling in strong winds and heavy rain, he spotted a clearing in the forested terrain, and decided to land there. While he was on short final to the clearing, the pilot inadvertently allowed the aircraft to collide with a tree, after which it traveled another 285 feet before impacting the ground. The student pilot had not received the required solo cross-country CFI pre-flight endorsement, and there was no record of him acquiring a weather briefing prior to the initiation of the flight or during any intermediate stop.","The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the trees while attempting to land in a field after entering an area of instrument meteorological conditions.

The pilot departed Boise, Idaho, in the Lycoming O-540-L3C5D powered Cessna TR182 arriving at Ft. Collins 3.0 hours of tach time later on the day before the accident.  The aircraft departed Boise with full (88 gallons useable) fuel tanks and remained overnight at Ft. Collins where there was no overnight security available.  The aircraft was fueled with 30 gallons of fuel at Ft. Collins the next day with 20 gallons in the right tank (to full according to the fueler) and 10 gallons in the left tank (to 3/4 full according to the fueler).  A credit card receipt for this fueling was date/time stamped for 1712.   A radar track showed the aircraft flying westbound crossing 7 nm south of Pocatello and 21 nm north of Gooding, Idaho, where public airports with lighted runways and fuel were located.  At 2112, in dark night conditions, the pilot radioed Salt Lake Air Route Traffic Control that he had an engine out and about one minute later referenced a 'field on fire' as a potential landing site.  The aircraft impacted terrain in the bottom of a shallow (+12 degree sloped) bowl in mountainous/hilly terrain throughout which a controlled burn was underway.  The left wing outboard leading edge impacted first, followed by the engine and there was no post-crash aircraft related fire.  The landing gear were down and the flaps were retracted.  The tach at the accident site read a total of 6.6 hours from the Boise departure reading.  Less than a pint of fuel was extracted from the aircraft's fuel system and there was no evidence of fuel leakage/staining on the aircraft. The pilot operating handbook performance data section showed the highest cruise fuel burn rate for the aircraft's engine was about 15.2 gallons/hour.

The pilot stated that after the initial takeoff, the cabin door ""came ajar.""  The flight returned and landed uneventfully where he closed the cabin door.  The flight again departed and the cabin door ""came ajar again.""  The flight returned and the airplane was landed, ""...with the landing gear up.""  Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the landing gear warning system was inoperative.  The microswitch for the left throttle/gear warning system was shorted internally and the roller arm was bent backwards.  The microswitch for the right throttle/gear warning system was not making contact with the throttle cam; buckling of the throttle attachment plate was noted.  Manual operation of the microswitch of the right throttle/gear warning system would trip the circuit breaker.  The left microswitch was removed from the circuit and manual activation of the microswitch of the right throttle/gear warning system activated the gear warning system.  Examination of the cabin door revealed that when the cabin door was closed and latched, the outside door handle was extended away from the door approximately 1.5 inches; a rusted and broken spring was noted.  Operational check of the door latch mechanism was accomplished  revealing no binding noted; the door locked.  The upper latch was found to go over center with the door latched and the aft latch bolt ""...locked properly.""  The two rivets that secure the pin guide assembly to the door were found broken.  There were no written discrepancies pertaining to the cabin door between May 25, 2000, and September 7, 2001.  During that same time frame, one discrepancy related to the gear warning system was noted.  The entry indicates that the throttle warning horn circuit breaker popped during descent to land prior to having the landing gear extended.  Airworthiness Directive (AD) 97-14-15, effective date of September 2, 1997, applicable to the accident airplane, to prevent unintentional opening of the cabin side door and the utility door from the interior of the airplane, was complied with on October 4, 1997.  The airplane had accumulated approximately 1,281 hours at the time of the accident since compliance.

After a maximum performance takeoff (to clear wires) from a parking lot, the helicopter departed the area to the west and climbed to an altitude of 5,500 feet msl.  After selecting a landing zone, the pilot turned northwest toward the area and initiated a descent.  The pilot's intention was to bring the helicopter to a high hover, allow the dust to settle, and then land.  As the helicopter descended to about 200 feet agl, at an airspeed of 115-120 knots, the pilot initiated a right turn into the wind.  As the helicopter was turning, the pilot realized the turn was ""too steep"" and tried to shallow the turn; however, the cyclic would not move.  At one point the pilot tried to neutralize the cyclic with both hands but to no avail.  The pilot did not remember any ""stiffness"" with the collective, and he did not hear a warning horn or see any lights illuminate.  Subsequently, the helicopter impacted the ground.  No pre-impact anomalies were observed during an examination of the airframe and engine.  No anomalies were noted during the examination and testing of the hydraulic servos that would have prevented their operation.",The seizing of the cyclic control for an undetermined reason.  A contributing factor was the lack of altitude for the pilot to regain control of the helicopter.

A MDHI 600N helicopter, operated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, was found to have a fractured tail boom attach bolt during a routine ground examination of the helicopter  for evening ground standby duty.  The pilot stated that as he pushed sideways on the tail boom it seemed loose.  Subsequent examination by maintenance personnel found that the head half of the upper right 5/16-inch tail boom attach bolt was hanging loose by the safety wire.  Examination of the bolt revealed that it had failed about three threads from the bolt shank.  The remainder of the threaded portion of the bolt remained in the plate nut affixed to the fuselage.  Fretting was observed on the fuselage and tail boom mating points in proximity to the fractured bolt.  Areas of the bolt shank exhibited polishing.  Subsequent examination for collateral damage revealed cracks were present at the aluminum attach fitting and associated angles.  The operator examined two of their other 600N helicopters and found those with cracks at the same location.  Two other local area law enforcement operators also found cracks in the same location.  The tail boom is attached to the fuselage with four special OEM produced bolts.  The helicopter tail boom is required to be removed every 300 flight hours for inspection, and, in addition is occasionally removed for other servicing procedures.  Examination of the maintenance records disclosed that the bolts may have been through about 10 torque cycles.  The bolts have no life limit.  The failed 5/16-inch bolt, p/n HS5482-5-18, is torqued to 150-inch/pounds during installation.  On November 2, 2001, MDHI issued service bulletin SB600N-036, which prescribes procedures for inspecting the upper right tail boom, attach bolt, and attach fitting assembly.  ""The Part 1 inspection requirements of this bulletin shall be accomplished within the next five (5) hours of helicopter operation after the receipt of this bulletin or within thirty (30) days of the issue date of this bulletin, whichever occurs first.""  ""The Part 2 inspection and repair requirements of this bulletin shall be accomplished within the next twenty-five (25) hours of helicopter operation after the receipt of this bulletin or within ninety (90) days of the issue date of this bulletin, whichever occurs first.""

The pilot was conducting a test flight to do a further ""run-in"" on the engine, which had 3.0 hours since major overhaul.  He stated that the engine ran smoothly and that all pressures and temperatures were normal prior to a point on the return flight where at approximately 5 miles northeast of the airport, the engine temporarily faltered.  At that point, the pilot was able to reestablish power by manipulating the mixture control lever.  He was concerned about his position over a densely populated area and modified his approach by circling south of the airport.  At approximately 4 miles south of the airport, the engine began to run rough and quit, ""similar to a fuel starvation failure.""  The pilot was unable to regain engine power and he landed the airplane in a field.  During the landing roll, he applied the brakes, and the airplane tipped nose down.

The pilot stated that as the gear was retracted, following a low approach, a ""loud bang or clank,"" was heard.  The landing gear in-transit light remained illuminated and the flight proceeded to a practice area where the pilots consulted with the flight school's maintenance personnel via radio.  Attempts to correct the gear problem were unsuccessful.  The flight then returned to the airport and executed a low pass near the air traffic control tower (ATCT).  ATCT personnel reported that both main landing gear appeared down and locked, but the nose landing gear appeared to be partially extended.  Subsequently, the airplane landed, and when the nose gear made ground contact, it collapsed.  Post landing examination of the airplane revealed that the nose gear actuator retract arm had fractured and was in two pieces.  The nose gear actuator retract arm was examined at the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, D.C.  It was determined that the retract arm fractured as a result of fatigue cracking that initiated at multiple origins along machining marks on the upper surface of the fracture.",The failure of the nose gear actuator retract arm due to fatigue.

The glider impacted terrain while attempting an off-airport landing.  The pilot reported that she had an aileron flight control problem during the accident flight.  The pilot stated turns to the right were made without any anomalies and turns to the left were ""stiff and resistant"".   The pilot reported, ""Aircraft did not respond as usual.  Airspeed did not equate to attitude.""  The pilot stated, ""There was a sound of air being forced through a crevice or a hole.""  The pilot described the sound as a ""hum or whine"".  The pilot elected to turn back to the airport and attempt a normal traffic pattern and landing.   The pilot reported she executed a right and left turn while on the downwind leg and the turn to the left was ""stiff, sluggish and slow to respond.""  The pilot stated during a right turn to the final approach course she was unable to stop the right turn using left control stick input.  The pilot elected to land on a rough and uneven agricultural field adjacent to the airport.   A witness to the accident reported the glider had made both right and left turns while in the traffic pattern.  According to the Soaring Flight Manual, as published by the Soaring Society of America, ""[A turning slip] is accomplished by applying rudder opposite to the turn while maintaining the bank angle with aileron.""  The manual states, ""Caution should be exercised during slips since the airspeed indicator is not accurate.  The reason for this situation is that air does not flow directly into the pitot tube in uncoordinated flight.  References, such as the position of the nose with respect to the horizon, and sound are usually more reliable.""

The pilot departed Centennial Airport (elevation 5,883 feet) VFR to practice multiple instrument approaches at night.  He told his wife that he would turn the cockpit lights up bright to facilitate instrument training.  After two ILS approaches, he requested, from ATC, two turns in the holding pattern before flying additional approaches.  The ATC controller cleared him for the practice holding, and assigned him to fly at 9,000 feet.  During the inbound track (347 degrees), radar data indicated that the airplane descended from its assigned altitude to 7,600 feet with no ATC intervention.  Next, the pilot requested to depart the initial approach fix to the southeast for approximately 15 nm at 8,500 feet.  The ATC controller cleared the request, but didn't terminate radar services.

The amateur-built airplane nosed over during a forced landing in a soft field following the partial failure of the aileron and elevator control system.  The two pilots flew the tandem seat airplane as part of the Phase 1 flight testing requirements following the completion of the experimental airplane's manufacture.  At the conclusion of the flight test, the pilots noticed that there was something wrong with the flight controls when they went to return to their departure airport.  The pilots determined that they had no aileron control and limited elevator control by use of the electric trim, but maintained rudder control.  They elected to land in a field that would allow a straight in approach.  The approach and landing were uneventful until the landing gear wheels dug into the soft dirt, resulting in the airplane nosing over.  The FAA inspector, who examined the airplane following the accident, reported that the bolt and nut that connect the aileron and elevator control tubes to the airframe were not in place.

The certified flight instructor was teaching his recently soloed primary student how to perform a crosswind takeoff and landing.  To accomplish this, the CFI selected a runway that would expose his student to a near 90-degree left, 8-knot crosswind condition.  The airplane touched down on the runway's centerline.  However, immediately thereafter it drifted right.  The CFI took the controls from his student and applied left aileron and rudder correction to return back to the runway centerline.  Even using full flight control inputs, the airplane continued skidding right.  Seconds thereafter, directional control was lost and the airplane started a quick left turn toward the left side of the runway.  The CFI attempted to redirect the airplane back to the right, but it was ""too little too late,"" and the airplane collided with a sign.  The CFI continued the touch-and-go landing and took off.

The commercial certificated pilot was transporting a barrel of aviation fuel to a remote airport.  The fuel was intended for company use on CFR Part 135 flights scheduled for later in the day.  The pilot said he noticed snow drifts across the approach end of the runway, and he decided to over-fly the area of drifted snow.  The airplane touched down about 1,000 feet from the approach end.  Because there was snow on the remaining portion of the runway, the pilot said he kept his roll-out speed higher than normal to avoid getting stuck in the snow.  When the pilot attempted to fully retard the engine throttle, he said the engine idle would not go below about 1,500 rpm. The pilot said he saw the end of the runway approaching, and applied the brakes, but said there was no braking action.  He said he then debated about shutting off the engine, applying full brakes, and sliding off the runway.  The pilot said he applied full power to go-around.  The airplane became momentarily airborne before colliding with a snow-covered gravel berm.  The left wing of the airplane separated from the fuselage as it bounced upward.  The airplane caught fire and came to rest inverted.  Witnesses and pedestrians ran to the wreckage with fire extinguishers and pulled the pilot from the wreckage.  The airplane was destroyed.  Witnesses reported three airplanes landed before the arrival of the accident airplane.  The witnesses said the accident airplane landed on the runway, but added engine power as it approached within about 300 feet of the end of the runway.  The airplane appeared to become airborne to a height of about 18 inches, and did not gain any additional altitude.  The airplane then collided with the gravel berm.  The runway is 6,250 feet long, and 100 feet wide.

The pilot lost control of his airplane while cruising at 16,000 feet in instrument meteorological conditions.  The airplane entered a spin and impacted the ground at 7,100 feet mean sea level.  An examination of the airplane wreckage did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions.  About 1 hour prior to departure the pilot had received a weather briefing.  The briefer advised the pilot that there was an AIRMET along his proposed route of flight.  The AIRMET forecast was for occasional moderate turbulence from the surface to 16,000 feet, and indicated occasional moderate icing in clouds and precipitation from the 12,000 foot freezing level up through 24,000 feet.  The airplane was not equipped or certificated for flight into known icing conditions.  While en route at 16,000 feet, with an average ground speed of 155 knots, the pilot encountered downdrafts.  The pilot broadcast to the radar controller that he was ""unable to maintain this altitude with this downdraft,"" requested permission to descend to 15,000 feet, and was cleared to descend.  Recorded radar data indicated that the airplane's course changed from northwesterly to southeasterly, and then northeasterly, while its ground speed gradually decreased to 61 knots.  The airplane's last recorded radar position was at 8,800 feet, and the airplane impacted into the underlying terrain within a 50-foot radius of this location.  About 2 hours thereafter, another pilot reported experiencing severe turbulence while descending from 16,000 to 13,000 feet over the accident site vicinity.","the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed after continuing flight into forecast adverse meteorological conditions consisting of turbulence, icing, and downdrafts, which resulted in a stall/spin."

While making a Visual Flight Rules approach in Instrument Flight Rules conditions, the airplane impacted trees and terrain 1.5 miles from the airport.  There is no record that the pilot requested or received a weather briefing for the flight.  A witness at the airport said that he heard an aircraft circling in the vicinity of the airport; however, he could not see it because of the low clouds and fog over the field.  Using his hand-held radio on the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) 122.7, the witness established contact with the pilot.  The pilot said he was trying to land at the airport, and at one point could see the runway lights through the fog, but had lost sight of the runway.  The witness then heard the aircraft continue to the east at what sounded like a reduced power setting.  The witness did not hear any unusual engine sounds emanating from the airplane.  There was no further communications from the pilot.   A resident living near the crash site heard the sounds of an impact  and reported the event to the sheriff's department.  Search efforts were hampered by fog and low visibility conditions and the wreckage was not located until about 1000 the next day.  The accident site is 1.5 miles north east of the airport at an elevation about 200 feet higher than the runway.  The airport manager estimated the visibility to be about 1-mile with a 300-foot ceiling.

The airplane sustained substantial damage on impact with terrain and an object following a gear collapse during landing roll.  The pilot was uninjured.  A mechanic stated, ""When lifted the Right wing the gear fell down and locked.  I jacked the left wing to engage the lock, the left gear was down but, was not locked.  The nose gear would not fall down due to the gear doors were bent, so I used the hydraulic pump to push it down and it locked.""  FAA inspectors found that the airplane landed long and touched down on the left side of the centerline.  An inspector stated, ""Photographs indicate that the aircraft immediately began a hard right turn.  Shortly before exiting the runway, skid marks show that the right main landing gear started to fold up.  The aircraft came to rest on the east side of the runway with the nose and right main gear retracted.  One runway light was broken off after it was struck with the left wing.  The pilot reported, ""As I turned from base to final, I again ordered a pre-landing checklist noting that the gear was showing 3 green lights on the panel.  The initial phase of the landing and touch down seemed normal but after a short period (I cannot define how need) as the aircraft proceeded down the centerline, I noticed the right side of the aircraft descending as though the right gear was collapsing and the right wing descending toward the pavement.""",The gear collapse for undetermined reasons during the landing roll.

The transport airplane was in cruise flight at flight level 390 for 12 minutes when they received an ""engine oil filter bypass"" fault message on the engine centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) system; however, all of the engine parameters remained within limits.  Subsequently, the oil pressure indication for the #1 (left) engine rose into the red band and a ""high vibration and a thumping sound"" was felt and heard.  The flight crew then declared an emergency and diverted to another airport.  The captain reported that during the landing roll, he moved both throttle levers into reverse, and simultaneously the cockpit and cabin began to fill with smoke.  Air traffic controllers reported they observed white smoke emanating from the #1 engine during the landing roll.  The captain stopped the airplane on the high-speed taxiway, turned off both engines, and an emergency evacuation ensued.  The 1L and 2L doors were operated normally; however, the 1R door jammed when the flight attendant attempted to open it.  Examination of the 1R door actuator and slide did not reveal the reason it failed to operate.  Examination of the engine revealed that debris contamination of the #3 bearing initiated spallation of the bearing's outer ring raceway.  Cyclic loading from the bearing balls passing over the growing raceway spall resulted in extensive fretting of the outer diameter surface of the outer ring, from which a fatigue crack was initiated.  High-cycle fatigue progression radially through the outer ring was followed by rapid fracture and subsequent liberation of the outer ring fragments.  The debris contamination more than likely came from the high-pressure compressor (HPC) stubshaft coating, which was liberated and entered the #3 bearing area causing it to fracture, and the engine to lose power.  Research revealed this was one of five similar occurrences, which was traced down to a change in the manufacture process for the HPC stubshaft coating.  The manufacturer has taken actions to alert operators of the existing problem.","the #1 engine's fatigue failure of the #3 bearing due to the manufacturer's inadequate design of the high-pressure compressor stubshaft coating, which resulted in a loss of engine power and an emergency landing."

The helicopter collided with trees in an avocado grove and then terrain.  The helicopter was believed to have departed a nearby airport, about 15 minutes prior to the accident on November 4, 2001, for a flight to the accident location.  Farm workers found the wreckage on the morning of November 6, 2001.  The wreckage was about 100 yards from a landing pad on the pilot's property, which was about 10 miles from departure airport.  The elevation of the pad was about 1,600 feet.  A certified flight instructor (CFI) at the departure airport saw the pilot preparing the helicopter for flight about 1715 on November 4.  The CFI said the visibility was 4 miles with haze and going down.  The automated surface observation station indicated that skies were clear at 1714 with 4 miles visibility and mist; the field elevation was 28 feet.  The temperature/dew point spread was less than 3 degrees.  By 1745, there were broken clouds at 1,000 feet; the visibility and temperature/dewpoint spread had not changed.  The pilot always approached the landing pad, which was unlit, from the northeast.  Investigators did not discover any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter or engine.  Sunset occurred at 1659, civil twilight occurred at 1724, and nautical twilight occurred at 1753.  The helicopter did not have an artificial horizon.  The instrument panel had a placard indicating that the pilot must have sufficient illumination to operate by outside light sources.  The Pilot Operating Handbook had the limitation that the pilot must maintain orientation at night by lights on the ground or by adequate celestial illumination.","the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate clearance from obstacles while approaching to land at his private helipad.  Factors in the accident were night conditions, inadequate illumination of the landing pad, and a likely low visibility condition due to fog."

During en route cruise, the number four cylinder exhaust valve guide separated from its associated cylinder head. When the aircraft was approximately 12 miles from the airport, the head of the  number four cylinder exhaust valve separated from the valve stem. The exhaust valve head then dropped into the number four cylinder where it repeatedly impacted the piston dome and the cylinder head ceiling. This was followed by approximately 30 percent of the piston dome failing inward, resulting in the pressurization of the crankcase through the open exhaust valve port.  As a result of the pressurization of the case, one of the number six cylinder pushrod-to-crankcase seals was forced off of its crankcase mounting surface, allowing the majority of the oil to escape from the engine. Soon thereafter, due to thermal stress, the number one connecting rod separated from the crankshaft and punched holes in the crankcase near the number one and number two crankshaft journals. After experiencing a total loss of power, the pilot attempted to land on the uneven rolling terrain, but due to the darkness of the night collided with the terrain.","The separation of the number four cylinder exhaust valve guide from the cylinder head, leading to the failure of the exhaust valve stem and the catastrophic failure of the engine while in cruise flight. Factors include the necessity of attempting a forced landing in rolling/hilly terrain on a very dark night."

The aircraft struck trees during an aborted landing. The pilot lost directional control and then became airborne again. The pilot stated ""When I again touched down I was approx 30 angle to the runway, heading 310 looking directly at runway marker.  I pushed throttle to full power (too fast) which caused the engine to spit and sputter.  I was able to lift up enough to miss runway marker but was not gaining any more altitude.  The terrain below was going down because of side hill, then came the trees which are on the neighbors property north of strip, I didn't think I could bank to the left hard enough to miss the trees without having left wing touch the ground.  So instead I banked some to the left to avoid direct fuselage hit to tree limbs.

The airplane was damaged when it overran the runway while landing.  Airplane was piloted by a certified flight instructor (CFI) and student.  The dual student held a private pilot certificate.  In a written report, the CFI said that he and his student were performing a simulated engine failure to runway 22 at ULM.  He said that, ""...upon reaching final we were high.  In my [judgment] however we had room to stop safely.  Upon touchdown I applied [brakes], and realized that we were slipping on the grass, and would not be able to stop.  So I added full power with one notch of flaps for a short field takeoff.  As the end of the runway approached I knew that we would not have enough airspeed to takeoff.  Therefore I closed the throttle and applied full [brakes] as we went into the plowed field off the end of [runway] 22.""  During an interview , the CFI told the inspector that he took control of the airplane at the touchdown. In his written report, the CFI indicated no mechanical malfunction of the airplane and no anomalies were found during a postaccident examination of the airplane.","The student and flight instructor not using all of the available runway, the inadequate supervision by the flight instructor and the unsuccessful remedial action by the flight instructor.

Prior to accepting delivery of the new helicopter, the pilot noticed a 4 percent decay in rotor rpm when the collective control was lowered after landing, activating the aural and visual LOW ROTOR RPM warnings. After a few seconds, engine and rotor speed returned to normal. The engine manufacturer said it should be of no concern as long as it operated normally during flight, but suggested adjusting the linear variable differential transducer after they ferried the helicopter home. On the day of the accident, the pilot intended to make a low pass and land at a hospital helipad. He lowered the collective control and noticed rotor rpm had decreased to 96 percent. The LOW ROTOR RPM warnings activated. He realized he was too low to attempt an autorotation. He reduced collective and pitch attitude further. RPM drooped to 90 percent, and stabilized.  Approximately 20 to 30 feet above the helipad, the pilot raised the collective control to flare for landing. RPM rapidly deteriorated. The aircraft impacted the helipad in a tail-down position, rolled over, and came to rest on its left side. The operator found the rotary variable differential transformer rigged at 57.9 degrees of twist grip travel at the Flight Gate position. According to the A119 maintenance manual, the device is supposed to be rigged to achieve 60 degree (+ or - 1 degree).

The pilot attempted to extend the landing gear using the emergency manual extension hand pump.  He reported the "". . .pump handle was locked solid and would not move. . .""  He couldn't get the selector handle to recenter as it was supposed to and he didn't get a landing gear extended cockpit indication.  The pilot elected to return to the departure airport.  The pilot performed a flyby past the air traffic control tower and the controller radioed that all three gear appeared to be down; however, the pilot's wife, in the right seat, told him she couldn't see a wheel on that side of the airplane.  During the ensuing landing, the right main landing gear collapsed, the right wing contacted the runway, and the airplane veered off the runway to the right.  The aircraft was delivered for the annual inspection with a landing gear extension discrepancy.  A misrigging problem on the left main landing gear seemed to explain all of the symptoms and was repaired.  The gear was satisfactorily cycled 10 times using an external hydraulic pressure source (mule).  Inspection subsequent to the accident revealed that, although functional, the output of the engine-driven hydraulic pump was deficient and insufficient to operate the gear.  The emergency hand pump and emergency gear extension system operated normally.  The maintenance facility manager speculated that the reason the pilot was not able to extend the landing gear with the emergency hand pump was because he didn't first fully extend the handle.  If the telescoping handle shaft is not fully extended the handle cannot be moved and feels similar to a ""hydraulic lock.""",The failure of maintenance personnel to properly diagnose the cause of a reported maintenance discrepancy resulting in the airplane being released from an annual inspection with a worn hydraulic pump which lacked sufficient output to operate the landing gear.  Another cause was the pilot's improper execution of the landing gear emergency extension procedure by failing to fully extend the manual hydraulic pump handle prior to attempting emergency gear extension.

The pilots reported that while the accident aircraft was on downwind, a light helicopter (believed to be a Robinson R22) entered final approach.  The flight instructor reported that the helicopter cleared the active runway ""about one-half to one-quarter mile before our touchdown."" The trainee stated that after clearing the runway, the helicopter moved right to the parallel taxiway, approximately 180 feet from the runway.   The pilots reported that approximately 200 to 300 feet past the runway threshold, the aircraft suddenly rolled right, yawed right, and sank, and that despite control inputs to attempt to counter these motions, the aircraft touched down right-wing-low in the grass adjacent to the runway.  The pilots elected to continue the landing rollout in the grass.  During the landing rollout, the aircraft's nose gear failed.  The instructor indicated that no mechanical malfunction or failure was involved in the accident.  An R22 on the parallel taxiway at the north  end of the airport is approximately 7 main rotor diameters from the runway, well outside the three main rotor diameters specified by the FAA Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) for rotor wash avoidance from a helicopter in a slow hover taxi or stationary hover.  The accident aircraft's maximum gross weight is also approximately twice that of the R22.  Dark night visual meteorological conditions, with calm winds, were reported by the flight instructor.","The pilots' failure to maintain aircraft control on short final, resulting in a touchdown off of the prepared landing surface.  A factor was grassy terrain encountered on the landing rollout."

While northeast of Lincoln, Nebraska, the pilot reported to the Lincoln Municipal Airport (LNK) Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) that he had bottomed out on fuel.  ATCT issued the pilot vectors to the Wahoo Municipal Airport, Wahoo, Nebraska.  The pilot reported he had the airport in sight but was not going to be able to make it. The airplane impacted trees and terrain 3 miles west of AHQ.  An examination of the airplane's fuel system showed no evidence of fuel.  An examination of the airplane's engine and remaining systems showed no anomalies.","The pilot's inadequate preflight planning/preparation resulting in fuel exhaustion during cruise flight, and the unsuitable terrain for landing encountered by the pilot during the subsequent forced landing.

The pilot said they departed Anoka County Airport (ANE) for some touch and go landings.  The pilot said they performed two uneventful patterns and landings.  As the airplane turned onto final approach for the third pattern, the engine stopped.  The pilot recalled there was no roughness or sputtering prior to the complete loss of power.  The airplane's flaps were set at 10-degrees and the landing gear was down.  An engine restart was attempted with no success.  The pilot said, ""The landing gear was brought up to increase our glide distance but the airport could not be made.  The terrain was wooded with homes interspersed.  No good landing areas were apparent so I steered towards the trees rather than the homes.  I then made an emergency call to the ANE control tower.  We clipped trees with the right wing followed by the left wing.  It was a hard impact and I was knocked unconscious soon after that.  We landed nose first in a grove of trees close to a detached garage.""  The passenger in the rear seat said that they had been operating in the traffic pattern approximately 20 to 30 minutes when the engine quit.  The passenger said the propeller continued to windmill.  They turned base to final.  Then the airplane's right wing hit a large tree.  The airplane then went straight down.  The passenger said as he got out of the airplane, he noted that fire was on the ground all around the airplane.  The passenger said that when the airplane's engine quit, he noticed the right seat passenger reach over the pilot to get something.  The passenger said the pilot tried to restart the engine, but it wouldn't start.  An examination of the airplane's fuel system revealed the fuel selector valve positioned between the left and right tank lines providing no fuel to flow through the valve.  An examination of the engine and other airplane systems revealed no anomalies.  According to the airplane owner's manual, the Engine Failure checklist reads, ""Fuel Selector - CHANGE TO OTHER CELL (check visually)""","Fuel starvation caused by the pilot's improper positioning of the fuel tank fuel selector while in the traffic pattern, and the unsuitable terrain encountered during the forced landing.

The airplane was damaged when it impacted the ground after takeoff from a private airstrip. In a written statement, the pilot said that the wind was light and from the northwest.  He said that he elected to takeoff downwind due to obstructions north of the airstrip.  He said that the airplane became airborne and flew to an altitude of about 30 to 50 feet above ground level when the airplane, ""...suddenly banked hard to right.  Pilot tried to correct with full left yoke deflection and slightly nose down elevator.  Right wing contacted [the] ground....""  A weather reporting station located about 26 miles and 200 degrees from the accident site recorded the wind as 9 knots from 340 degrees at 1053.

The  amateur-built experimental airplane was destroyed on impact with terrain during an uncontrolled descent.  The pilot was fatally injured.  The Sheriff's report stated, ""It had started to fall from approximately 500 feet.  I was advised that it appeared that the engine had stalled and that the aircraft began to spiral before hitting the ground.  The first witness on the scene advised that the engine had been running when he arrived.  The parachute on the aircraft had been deployed.  It appeared that the aircraft had hit the ground nose first.""  A  witness stated that he watched the airplane fly around for about a half hour.  He said the airplane was climbing and descending like a crop duster.  He said that he heard the engine shut down.  He said that he saw the airplane almost stand there, hung for a second or two, and nosed down.  The airplane corkscrewed to the left about three quarters of a turn.  He said the airplane did not go directly down and did not glide out of the descent.  When the airplane descended below a hill he heard two pops like a shotgun.    The accident was reported to the local  Automated Flight Service Station as an ultralight accident.  Photographs of the accident site showed level terrain available for a forced landing.","The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons, and the pilot's failure to maintain airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall/spin."

The amateur-built airplane was at 1,500 feet msl and maneuvering at a slow airspeed for 7-8 minutes when the engine lost power.  The pilot switched fuel tanks, restarted the engine, and continued the flight toward a nearby airport.  Prior to reaching the airport, the engine again lost power.  The pilot initiated a forced landing to a highway.  Due to traffic on the highway, the pilot had to delayed the landing, which resulted in the airplane continuing towards power lines.  As the pilot ""quickly landed the airplane,""  the nose landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to a stop upright on the highway.  During an examination of the airplane, 3 inches of fuel was found in both of the fuel tanks, and over 15 gallons of fuel was drained.  Upon further inspection of the fuel system, no blockages were found in the fuel lines, and the gascolator was clean.  The pilot suspected that a vacuum was created in both of the fuel tanks since there were no fuel tank vents, except for the vents in the fuel caps.  The airplane had accumulated 5 hours at the time of the accident.",loss of engine power while maneuvering for an undetermined reason.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

The Cessna 152 landed on runway 31, and the CFI planned for a ""long rollout"" so the student could practice taxiing.  During the rollout, the student pressed the left brake, and the airplane veered off the left side of the runway.  The CFI attempted to counteract the turn with right rudder and brake pressure, but was unable to avoid a parked Cessna.  The Cessna 152 then rotated to the left, its propeller sliced through the empennage of the Cessna 172, and it came to a stop.

The airplane collided with the runway during an attempted go-around.  The wind was from 120 degrees at 9 knots.  While on downwind, the pilot was aware that the wind was pushing him toward the runway and he had to correct more than he expected to stay parallel to the runway.  Once established on final, he lowered the flaps to 40 degrees, maintained 65 mph, and crabbed into the wind.  The approach was stable until the pilot flared.  He felt he must have taken some of his correction out, because just prior to touch down the airplane moved to the right side of the runway.  The left main landing gear touched down near the edge of the runway.  The pilot felt that if he continued the landing attempt, the right main and nose landing gear would be off the runway in dirt,  and he would be in position to collide with the lights along the runway.  He elected to attempt a go-around.  He added full power and the nose of the airplane pitched up, and the airplane bounced about 40 feet back into the air.  The airplane stalled, turned to the left, and struck the ground in a nose down, left wing low attitude near midfield.  Both wings and the fuselage sustained substantial damage.","The pilot failed to maintain directional control while landing in a cross wind.  He attempted a go-around, but inadvertently stalled the airplane, which resulted in an uncontrolled descent and collision with the runway."

The student pilot stated she encountered an autopilot trim failure on initial takeoff climb. She attempted to disconnected the autopilot with the autopilot disconnect red button on the control yoke with negative results. She stated she had not received any training on the autopilot system by the operator. Review of her training records supported her statement. Title 14 CFR Part 91.9 requires the pilot to comply with the operating limitations in the airplane flight manual. The airplane flight manual for the Cessna  172S requires the pilot to commit to memory the four step procedure for autopilot, autopilot trim, or electric trim malfunction. The student pilot did not comply with the written instruction in the flight manual and experienced a loss of aircraft control on landing (porpoise on runway) resulting in a hard landing on the nose gear. Examination of the autopilot before removal from the airplane and at the factory revealed no abnormalities were noted.","The operators failure to ensure adequate training had been provided to the student pilot in autopilot operations, and the student pilot's failure to comply/ follow written instructions (Federal Regulations/172 Skyhawk Information Manual) pertaining to the failure of the autopilot, autopilot trim, or manual electric trim malfunction.

The airplane impacted the ground following an aborted landing after a loss of directional control during landing. The pilot reported that the airplane lost engine power during the aborted landing attempt.  The pilot reported, ""On the take-off roll, just before rotation, the aircraft began to veer to the left.""  The pilot said that he rotated and retracted the landing gear normally.  The pilot stated that he had electrical problems during the flight and when he reached his destination he was unable to establish communications.  He said he confirmed that the landing gear was down by calling his father on his cellular telephone.  The pilot said that during the landing, when the nose wheel contacted the runway, the airplane again veered to the left.  The airplane departed the left side of the runway and the pilot aborted the landing.  The airplane struck the visual approach slope indicator during the aborted landing.  The airplane climbed to about 60 feet AGL when the engine lost power.  The pilot attempted to land on a road and the left wing struck the ground.  After the accident, fuel was observed running from beneath the airplane.   According to fueling records, the airplane was filled with fuel prior to departure.  The flow of fuel was ""stemmed"" by moving the fuel selector from the right position to the off position.  After the airplane was moved to a hangar, the inboard fuel cells were accessed and no fuel was found in the inboard right fuel cell.  The outboard fuel cells were broken loose from the aircraft structure.  The engine was broken loose from its mount and the propeller was separated from the engine.  The forward fuselage was crushed rearward.  Examination of the engine revealed compression on all cylinders and spark from the impulse coupled magneto was confirmed.  No fuel was found in the fuel distribution valve, or fuel injector lines.  The alternator drive belt was broken.  The alternator could not be turned by hand.  The alternator was removed and examined.  The alternator case halves were misaligned and the case exhibited evidence of impact damage.  The alternator case bolts were loosened and the alternator shaft rotated freely when misalignment pressures were relieved.   The nose wheel steering system consists of two rods attached to the top of a T-bar supported by two bearings mounted on the strut tube.  The T-bar is mounted on the forward side of the upper strut tube.  The lower end of the T-bar attaches to the steering collar on the nose wheel strut with a link.  The link is on the left side of the centerline of the nose wheel strut.  The link was fractured and the fracture surfaces exhibited signatures consistent with tension overload failure.  No other anomalies were found with respect to the airframe, engine, or systems, that could be identified as existing prior to impact.  A witness reported that the airplane was not developing full power during the aborted landing.","The inadequate fuel consumtion calculations by the pilot resulting in fuel starvation during the aborted landing, and the overloaded steering link for undetermined reasons resulting in the lack of directional control during landing.  Factors were the electrical system failure for undetermined reasons, the visual approach slope indicator (VASI) system, and the altitude/clearance from the VASI not possible by the pilot."

The pilot and passenger were en route on a night cross-country flight when the engine experienced a partial power loss.  The pilot pulled on carburetor heat for about 10 seconds and then with no change in engine operation, returned the carburetor heat to cold and told the passenger he thought the engine was experiencing vapor lock.  The pilot was unable to restore full power and struck trees during the execution of an off airport, forced landing.  Examination revealed evidence of a fuel spill at the accident site.  The engine was run and no problems were noted.  A check of weather along the route of flight revealed the temperature and dewpoint spreads were getting closer together as the flight continued towards its destination.  The spread at the accident site was 3 degrees C.  According to FAA publications a temperature spread of 11 degrees C  corresponds to a relative humidity of about 50 percent, and there is an increased likelihood of carburetor icing.  Further, the FAA stated, ""If detected, full carburetor heat should be applied immediately, and it should be left in the on position until the pilot is certain that all the ice has been removed.""  The FAA carburetor icing chart revealed the airplane nearing conditions of serious icing at cruise power.  The toxicological examination found an over-the-counter antihistamine in the pilot's blood.  Adverse affects for the antihistamine included, drowsiness.","the pilot's improper use of carburetor heat, and subsequent forced landing.  Factors were the carburetor icing condition, night conditions, trees, and the pilot's impairment from ingestion of an over-the-counter antihistamine."

During en route cruise, the airplane's engine began to run rough.  This was followed by a loud bang, and a cylinder penetrated the engine cowling.  A forced landing was performed to a field.  During the  ground roll, one main landing gear struck a hole, after which, it collapsed.  The airplane yawed, and the other main landing gear also collapsed.  Examination revealed that the number 3 cylinder had pulled away from the engine case.  All through bolts and engine case bolts were separated.  In addition, the piston and piston wrist pin were fractured.  Oil was found in the engine sump.  Maintenance records revealed that the cylinders had been removed and replaced 146 hours prior to the occurrence.

During an instructional flight the airplane entered an inadvertent spin and subsequently impacted the terrain.  The plotted aircraft radar track data showed the airplane performing a maneuver consistent with a clearing turn prior to the airplane decelerating at a constant altitude.  The plotted data then shows the airplane reversing course and entering a spiraling descent.  The average descent rate for the last 50.82 seconds of aircraft radar track data was 2,125 feet/minute.  No anomalies were found with the accident airplane that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.  Diphenhydramine (trade name Benadryl), an over-the-counter antihistamine with sedative effects, was detected in the blood of the certified flight instructor (CFI) at a level consistent with that found about 2-3 hours following ingestion of a single maximum over-the-counter dose.  The effects of over-the-counter antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, was evaluated in a medical study, which concluded that a normal over-the-counter dose of diphenhydramine adversely affected performance more than a 0.1% blood alcohol concentration.  The study further concluded that there was no correlation between drowsiness and impairment.","The failure of the flight crew to maintain adequate airspeed, resulting in an inadvertent stall/spin and the flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight, his impairment due to the use of over-the-counter medication is a contributing factor."

On November 12, 2001, about 0916:15 eastern standard time, American Airlines flight 587, an Airbus Industrie A300-605R, N14053, crashed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport, Jamaica, New York. Flight 587 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight to Las Americas International Airport, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, with 2 flight crewmembers, 7 flight attendants, and 251 passengers aboard the airplane. The airplane's vertical stabilizer and rudder separated in flight and were found in Jamaica Bay, about 1 mile north of the main wreckage site. The airplane's engines subsequently separated in flight and were found several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. All 260 people aboard the airplane and 5 people on the ground were killed, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. Flight 587 was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.",the in-flight separation of the vertical stabilizer as a result of the loads beyond ultimate design that were created by the first officer's unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs. Contributing to these rudder pedal inputs were characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program.

At 2144, the pilot contacted air traffic control and requested visual flight rules (VFR) flight following to his destination.  The flight was the final leg of a four-leg trip, which the pilot had begun approximately 1120 that morning.  At 2220, the flight began a slow descent toward the destination airport.  Radar data confirmed that the airplane executed a steady descent, and flew a straight line course toward Graham.  The final radar return occurred 37 minutes later at an altitude of 3,000 feet (radar coverage is not available below 3,000 feet), 8 miles southeast of the Graham Municipal Airport.  Two minutes after the final radar return, the pilot reported to air traffic control that the flight was two miles out, and he canceled VFR flight following.  No further communications or distress calls were received from the airplane.  The pilot did not request or receive updated weather from the air traffic controllers during the flight.  According to witnesses who lived near the accident site, they heard an airplane flying low, observed dense fog and heard the sounds of an airplane crashing.  According to the nearest weather reporting station, near the time of the accident, the temperature- dew point spread was within 2 degrees, visibilities were reduced to between 3 and 4 miles in fog, and the ceiling was decreasing from 600 feet broken to 400 feet overcast.  At the time of the accident, the pilot's duty day exceeded 12 hours.  Examination of the airframe revealed no preimpact anomalies and that the gear was extended and the flaps were retracted.  Examination of both engines revealed evidence of  power at the time of impact.","The pilot's failure to discontinue the approach after encountering instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain.  Contributing factors were the dark night light condition, low ceiling, and reduced visibility due to fog."

The pilot was conducting a fire suppression flight.  While indicating approximately 100 knots of airspeed, with an empty water bucket that was occasionally unstable during the flight, the pilot heard a ""bang.""  The helicopter yawed to the right, and the tail rotor quit spinning.  The pilot jettisoned the bucket, and because there was no place to land, he continued to the dip-point.  At the dip-point, the pilot selected an open area.  The area was sloped, but the pilot was uncertain of the airworthiness of the helicopter and did not want to look for another area.  He entered a ""needles joined autorotation.""  As the helicopter slowed, it started to spin to the right.  The spin stopped, the helicopter impacted the ground, and then rolled onto its right side with little or no power applied to the main rotor.  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the bucket had entered the arc of the tail rotor, and that the tail-rotor driveshaft was severed consistent with overload.  The operating manual for the bucket stated that the bucket had been proven stable up to an airspeed of approximately 96 knots, and that a bucket with a overall length greater than the distance from the cargo hook to the front arc of the tail rotor could result in a tail rotor strike.  The emergency procedure for a complete loss of tail rotor thrust in-flight was reduce throttle to idle, and immediately enter autorotation.  If a suitable landing site was not available, the vertical fin may permit controlled flight to a suitable area.",The pilots decision to operate the helicopter at an airspeed in excess of the maximum demonstrated stable airspeed for the water bucket.  A factor in the accident was the pilot did not follow the published emergency procedure.

The airplane departed on an IFR flight plan and ten minutes had elapsed when a vibration in the airframe was felt, which gradually intensified.  The pilot observed that the horizontal stabilizer was shaking with more intensity than the rest of the airplane.  The vibration continued to intensify to the degree that the cockpit instruments were unreadable.  The pilot declared an emergency to air traffic control and initiated an emergency descent.  He then slowed the airplane to 120 knots and the vibration subsided; however, the vibration was still apparent.  Subsequently, the airplane landed, and when the pilot exited the airplane, he observed that the left elevator was hanging 3-4 inches low, at the outboard end.  Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that the outboard left elevator hinge had separated from the horizontal stabilizer.  A section of the aft spar had separated from the horizontal stabilizer and remained attached to the elevator hinge.  Additionally, the left elevator trim tab push rod had separated in two places.  Approximately 10 flight hours prior to the accident, several dents were found on the left elevator.  The repair station reported that during the repair, rivets on a portion of the elevator were removed, and then replaced while the elevator remained attached the horizontal stabilizer.  They added that no abnormal stresses were placed on the elevator hinge attachments during the repairs.","the failure of the left outboard elevator attachment, which resulted in the partial separation of the left elevator and induced an airframe vibration."

During an aborted nighttime takeoff, the airplane continued off the end of the 4,987-foot-long runway, vaulted an embankment, and impacted a guardrail on an airport service road 30 feet below.  According to the manufacturer's pilot operating handbook, the takeoff distance required for the ambient conditions was 1,620 feet and the accelerate-stop distance was 2,945 feet.  Several witnesses reported observing the airplane traveling along the runway at an unusually high speed, with normal engine sound, and without becoming airborne; followed by an abrupt reduction in engine power and the sound of screeching tires.  Skid marks were present on the last 1,000 feet of the runway.  In the wreckage, the gust lock/control lock was found engaged in the pilot's control column.",The pilot's failure to remove the control gust lock prior to takeoff and his failure to abort the takeoff with sufficient runway remaining to stop the airplane on the runway.

On landing, the airplane veered off the runway, struck a taxiway sign, and sheared off the main landing gear.  The student was on his first supervised solo flight.  He completed one landing, taxied back, and the accident occurred on the second landing.  He maintained an approach speed between 70 and 75 knots until over the numbers.  He had the flaps at 40 degrees and the throttle in about 1/2 inch.  He reduced the throttle by half to land and landed a hard on the main gear.  The airplane bounced about 2 feet back into the air, so he fully reduced the power and the airplane settled back to the runway.  The airplane began to veer to the right; he countered with a little left rudder, but did not feel a correction.  He thought the airplane would leave the runway, and removed his right foot from the rudder pedal.  He stomped on the left pedal, but could not prevent the airplane from departing the runway.",Failure of the student pilot to maintain directional control during landing.

The pilot reported that this was the first flight after the aircraft had been completely restored.  The start, taxi and takeoff were normal.  During the climb, at about 150 feet AGL, the engine suddenly lost power.  The pilot was unable to return to the airport, therefore he chose to land on a Highway that parallels the airport.  The road was initially clear of traffic until a truck came over a rise.  The pilot maneuvered the aircraft to the side of the road and just before touch down, the left wing struck a tree which spun the aircraft to the left.  The main landing gear collapsed and the right wing contacted the surface.  After the accident, the pilot immediately exited the aircraft, then returned to secure the cockpit when it was safe.  The pilot found that the magneto switches, which are unguarded toggle switches located on the lower left side of the wall, were off.  The pilot reported that he did not recall turning off the switches prior to exiting the aircraft.  After the aircraft was moved back to the airport, the engine was started and run for several minutes with no evidence of a mechanical failure or malfunction noted.",The magneto was inadvertently switched off by the pilot during the climb.  A tree was a factor.

The agricultural airplane was returning from its first spray load of the day when it impacted trees and a swampy canal while on final approach to land.  The pilot radioed to the ground crew that he was inbound for landing and was not heard from again.  The airplane impacted trees located on the east side of the canal and the wreckage was found on the west side of the canal.  The flap actuator was found in the 10-degree extension setting.  Post-accident examination of the wreckage did not reveal any anomalies with the airframe, engine, or propeller that would have affected the aircraft's performance.  Toxicology tests detected 0.037 ug/ml of diphenhydramine in the pilot's blood and an unquantified amount of diphenhydramine in his urine.  Diphenhydramine (commonly known by the trade name Benadryl) is an over-the-counter antihistamine used in symptomatic management of allergic symptoms and also for its sedative, antitussive and antispasmodic effects.  The American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine conducted a study (Effects of Fexofenadine, Diphenhydramine, and Alcohol on Driving Performance) on the effects of diphenhydramine on driving performance.  The results of that study indicated that ""Participants had significantly better coherence after taking alcohol or fexofenadine (Allegra) than after taking diphenhydramine...After participants took diphenhydramine, driving performance was poorest, indicating that diphenhydramine had a greater impact on driving than alcohol did.""",in-flight collision with trees while on final approach to land for an undetermined reason.

The airplane departed the right side of runway 22R and struck a taxiway sign.  During the rollout, the nose of the airplane started to move to the left and the right, and the instructor took control of the airplane.  The instructor straightened the nose and continued the rollout.  As the airplane slowed, the airplane started to move to the right.  The instructor pumped left rudder, but the airplane continued to the right.  He applied and held full left rudder, but determined that the airplane would depart the runway.  He released the left rudder pedal and intended to stop in the dirt.  However, he did not see a runway sign, which collided with the lower right wing.  The collision spun the airplane around resulting in substantial damage to the lower wing spar.",Failure of the flight instructor to maintain directional control resulted in a departure from the runway surface and collision with a runway sign.

As the helicopter descended towards the ground during hovering autorotation maneuvers, the pilot applied aft cyclic, and the helicopter began to drift rearward.  The pilot increased the collective to stop the decent, and began to concentrate on the aft drift, when the helicopter touched down on the right main and nose landing gear.  The pilot added left cyclic to level the helicopter, but due to low rotor rpm, the control input had little effect.  The helicopter began to roll to the right, and the main rotor blades impacted the ground.  The helicopter came to rest on its right side.  According to the pilot's flight instructor, the accident flight was the pilot's fifth flight of the day, with the first four dual instructional flights being conducted in a Kaman H-43.  The last flight was to be conducted solo in the K-1200.  The pilot had previously flown the K-1200 four times.",The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while hovering.  A factor related to the accident was the pilots lack of experience in type of aircraft.

In a written statement, the pilot reported that during a medical transport flight he performed a precautionary off airport landing due to a problem with the helicopter's fuel transfer pumps.  After the repairs were made to the helicopter, the pilot initiated a normal departure under dark night conditions.  Shortly after departure the helicopter collided with terrain.  The pilot later reported that during the initial climb out, he lost visual references outside the aircraft and became disoriented just before the helicopter collided with terrain.  The pilot reported no mechanical malfunction or failure had occurred during the accident flight.",Pilot's failure to maintain adequate separation from terrain during the initial climb.  Factors include spatial disorientation and a dark moonless night.

The airplane was destroyed when it impacted the side of a ravine during a forced landing following a loss of engine power at night.  Witnesses described the airplane in a steep descent angle prior to impacting the ground.  One witness reported seeing the airplane flying in a westerly direction.  The witness said that she, ""... thought it was strange because there was no engine noise at all.""  She further stated that the airplane, ""...was going steady and all of a sudden the plane just fell out of the sky.  There was no gradual [descent] it just fell.""  Another witness reported that the airplane was at a low altitude with the engine ""sputtering"".  The witness reported that just prior to impact he heard the airplane, ""...go to full power.""  The pilot had accumulated 6.6 hours of flight time since receiving his private pilot certificate on August 27, 2001.  The pilot purchased the airplane on November 9, 2001.  Witness statements indicate that the pilot flew the airplane on November 11, 2001, and the airplane was fully fueled prior to that flight.  No records of subsequent fueling of the airplane were found.  A witness reported that, prior to the accident flight, he assisted the pilot in starting the engine because the airplane master switch had been left on.  The witness reported that he also performed a pre-flight inspection of the airplane and noted that the left fuel tank contained less than 1/4 tank of fuel, and the right fuel tank had 3/4 tank of fuel.   He said that he positioned the selector valve for the left tank and informed the pilot.  An ""Airplane Log"" recovered from the accident scene contains an entry for a 2.3 hour flight on November 11, 2001.  The entry lists an ending tachometer reading of 738.70 hours.  The recording tachometer reading at the accident site was 739.9 hours.  The fuel selector was found positioned for the right fuel tank.  The fuel hoses leading from the fuel tanks to the selector valve were cut during the investigation and any remaining liquid collected.  About one ounce of a blue colored liquid was drained from the fuel hose leading from the right fuel tank to the selector valve.  No liquid was found within the fuel hose leading from the left fuel tank to the selector valve.  No other anomalies were found, with respect to the airplane, engine or systems, that were determined to exist prior to impact.",The improper selection of the fuel selector which resulted in fuel starvation and subsequent engine failure. Factors were the unsuitable terrain for the forced landing encountered by the pilot and the night light condition.

The pilot had flown the airplane four days prior to the accident date, and after that flight, had inadvertently left the airplane's electrical master switch ""ON,"" which resulted in a discharged battery.  In order to start the engine, the pilot connected electrical power to the exterior battery receptacle.   The pilot then boarded the airplane and started the engine.  After the engine was started, the pilot ""set the engine rpm to a low setting,"" got out of the airplane, and removed the exterior power source and wheel chocks.   After removing the wheel chocks, the airplane started to move forward.  The pilot attempted to stop the airplane, but was unsuccessful.  Subsequently, the unoccupied airplane taxied across the airport into a wet field where it impacted a small ditch.",the pilot's failure to set the parking brake before exiting the aircraft to remove the wheel chocks.

The airplane was loaded with fishing and camping gear, and 15 gallons of 100LL aviation gasoline, in four, five-gallon fuel cans.  The fuel cans and the gear were secured under a cargo net in the airplane 2 days prior to the accident.  The pilot completed his preflight inspection with no anomalies noted, and checked the security of the cargo in the back of the airplane.  There was no evidence of fuel spillage and no odor of fuel in the cabin.  The pilot started the engine and taxied to the run-up area at the approach end of a runway, then applied the parking brake, and started the takeoff checklist.  During the checklist, there was an ""overwhelming fuel smell.""  The pilot shut down the engine with the mixture but left the master switch and the lights on.  He looked for fuel on the floor of the cabin, but I couldn't see any.  The pilot deplaned, and was about to close the door when the cabin exploded.",The pilot's improper stowage of hazardous material.

At 1809, the pilot received a weather briefing from Wichita Flight Service for a flight from LaCrosse, Kansas, to Dodge City, Kansas (DDC).  The controller told the pilot that VFR flight was not recommended and to expect instrument conditions at DDC. At approximately 1830, a witness observed the airplane fly over his house heading southwest.  The witness said the airplane turned south and went into a fog bank.  The witness then said the airplane came out of the fog bank heading west and diving.  The airplane hit the ground and exploded.  The witness said the airplane's lights were on and the engine was running.  An examination of the airplane revealed no pre-impact anomalies.  At 1856, the National Weather Service at DDC, 12 miles southwest of the accident site, reported winds 150 degrees at 13 knots, ceilings of 600 feet broken, 1,000 feet overcast, 5 miles visibility with mist, temperature 54 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 53 degrees F, and altimeter 30.27 inches of Mercury.

The pilot said that he departed on runway 31 at approximately 1415, and the takeoff seemed normal.  He said that at approximately 1,500 feet above ground level he reduced the throttle for cruise, reduced the propeller control, and adjusted his fuel mixture.  He noticed the manifold pressure rapidly dropped to approximately 15 inches of mercury pressure.  He switched fuel tanks and turned on the auxiliary fuel pump, believing that there was a vapor lock in the fuel line.  The engine lost power, and the propeller continued to windmill.  He pressed the boost pump switch and pulled the throttle out about an inch.  The engine still did not restart, so he performed a forced landing to a field.  During the landing attempt, the airplane was substantially damaged, and subsequently consumed by fire.  Postaccident investigation of the airframe and the engine revealed no anomalies which might have affected the airplane's performance before the accident.  Eight spark plugs were found black and sooty, and four were found wet.

A friend of the accident pilot reported that he and the accident pilot were involved in a musical show in Biloxi, Mississippi. They each flew their airplanes from their homes to Biloxi for the show. On the evening of November 15, 2001, he and the accident pilot flew to Biloxi, and parked their airplanes at the Ocean Springs Airport, in Ocean Springs. After the performance, he and the accident pilot visited with the cast and crew. The accident pilot may have had some beer and wine, he is not sure, but, he did not seem impaired. During the drive back to the airport, to fly home, they stopped at a convenience store so the accident pilot could buy cigarettes. He does not know if the accident pilot bought beer or anything else. At the airport, they each did a pre-flight inspection of their airplanes, and departed one after the other around 0100. The accident pilot departed first. The accident pilot flew a northerly course for a time. He flew a 300 degree course toward his destination of McComb, Mississippi. He, the friend of the accident pilot,  was talking with the accident pilot via the radio. It was a clear, cold night, with no clouds. Visibility was greater than 50 miles. He could see the lights of the accident airplane and saw it was further north than he would expect and at a lower altitude than he thought it should be at. The accident pilot indicated he had been having a sticky altimeter. The accident pilot turned toward him and came in a mile behind him. He was at 4,500 feet and the accident airplane appeared to be at the same altitude. The friend lost sight of the airplane, but continued to talk to the accident pilot via radio. A short time later, the friend of the pilot had an alternator over-voltage indication. He reported this to the accident pilot, and the accident pilot indicated he would turn and follow him to McComb, which was about 30 minutes away. As he approached to land at McComb, the accident pilot reported he was behind him, although the friend could not see him.  When he was on a one-mile final approach, he told the accident pilot that he was on final. The accident pilot told him to call him when he was on the ground. About two minutes later he called to tell the accident pilot he was on the ground. He did not get a response from the accident pilot. When the accident pilot failed to show up for the musical show in Ocean Springs on the evening of November 16, 2001, the friend reported him missing to an FAA Flight Service Station. Search and rescue operations were initiated and the accident pilot and airplane were located on November 30, 2001, about 1630. Radar data showed N89645 departed Ocean Springs Airport at approximately 0104 and proceeded in a northwesterly direction of approximately 295 degrees.  About one minute later, N739LV, piloted by the accident pilot's friend, departed.  At about 0112, N739LV passed N89645 at 3,600 feet, 4 miles north of Biloxi, MS.  No transponder returns were received from N89645.  Both airplanes flew a similar course until 0118:45 when N89645 turned to a course of approximately 320 degrees, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.  At 0124:02, N739LV began a series of turns corresponding with the pilot's statement that he was distracted by an alternator problem. At 0127:38, N89645 turned left to a course of about 270 degrees. The airplane was about 10 miles east of Poplarville, Mississippi at 3,600 feet. N739LV flew directly to MCB and landed at about 0158. At 0132:02, N89645 passed two miles southeast of Poplarville at 3,600 feet on a course of approximately 220 degrees.  For the next 20 minutes, N89645 descended and made numerous turns within 10 miles of Poplarville, in an area south and southwest of the airport.  The last radar return was received at 0153:14, eight miles southeast of Poplarville. Post crash examination of the crash site showed the airplane had collided with a tree, severing the outboard right wing, right horizontal stabilizer, and right main landing gear wheel. The airplane continued 100 feet across a river and crashed on the river bank. All components of the airplane which are neccessary for flight were located at the crash site. Examination of the airplane showed no evidence of pre-crash failure or malfunction of the airplane structure, flight controls, engine, or propeller.","The pilot's becoming lost and disoriented and his failure to maintain control of the airplane while flying over an unpopulated area on a dark night, which was the result of spatial disorientation. Factors in the accident was the pilot's consuming alcoholic beverages before the flight and the dark night."

The pilot stated that on November 16, 2001, he prepared to depart from his home airport, McCollum Field. As he performed an engine runup, he found the left magneto was not operating. He returned to the ramp and his mechanic disconnected and then reconnected the magneto ""P"" leads. The left magneto began to work. He departed McCollum Field and went to Peachtree City. He then flew to Tara Field, at Hampton, Georgia. When leaving Tara Field, he found that the left magneto was again inoperative. He called his mechanic and was told to disconnect the ""P"" leads and fly home. With the ""P"" leads disconnected, he could not check the magnetos. During takeoff, the engine appeared to develop full power. The EGT was normal. About 5 minutes after departure, the EGT pegged out high and one of the magnetos appeared to have quit. About a minute later, the engine quit. Atlanta Approach gave him radar vectors to the closest airport, Peachtree City. He could not make it to the airport and landed in a field with the gear down and full wing flaps extended. During rollout in the field, the airplane collided with a drainage ditch. The landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid to a stop. The magnetos had been overhauled by a local mechanic about 100 flight hours before the accident. During examination prior to running the engine after the accident, the ""P"" lead was disconnected from the right magneto and the spark retard lead was disconnected from the left magneto. The leads were reconnected and the engine was started. Only the right magneto was operating. The engine was operated to 1,500 RPM with a club propeller in the feathered position. The was no evidence of mechanical failure or malfunction of the engine assembly.The magnetos were tested at the manufacturers facilities. The left magneto condenser was inoperative causing the magneto to not operate. The right magneto operated normally. Manufacturer personnel stated that with one magneto inoperative, the exhaust gas temperature will become elevated due inefficient burning in the cylinder which carries over into the exhaust area. When you remove the ""P"" lead on these magnetos, they actually ground internally and become inoperative. Sometimes contamination prevents them from grounding immediately when the ""P"" lead is removed, but they eventually ground and become inoperative. He believes that with the spark retard disconnected on the left magneto and the ""P"" lead disconnected on the right magneto, that the left and right magnetos operated for takeoff due to the condenser working at this time on the left magneto and that the ""P"" lead internal grounding had contamination that prevented it from grounding immediately after removal of the ""P"" lead. Takeoff was normal at full power due to both magnetos working. Then either the left magneto quit due the condenser failing or the right quit due to it becoming internally grounded. The exhaust gas temperature went high and a small loss of power could be noted. Then the second magneto quit resulting in failure of the engine.",The pilot’s attempted operation of the aircraft with known deficiencies in the engine ignition system resulting in failure of the engine due to ignition system failure and damage to the airplane during the subsequent  forced landing.

The pilot said he had been airborne for about 20 minutes and looked at the JPI indicator which showed that the oil temperature was 89 degrees and the oil pressure was zero. He said he then entered a turn to go to State Road 84 and execute an emergency landing, and during the turn a loud bang occurred and the engine ceased operating. He then saw a dirt road about 15 miles southwest of State Road 84, and executed a forced landing there instead, but during the landing rollout the left wing tip impacted a pick-up truck that had been parked on the dirt road and it veered into a ditch. The FAA Inspector who responded to the accident scene found clean oil on the bottom of the fuselage, but did not determine the source of the oil leak. The following day when salvage personnel returned to the accident scene to retrieve the airplane wreckage for a detailed examination,  they found that the airplane had burned. The engine compartment and aft, to include the cabin and inboard two thirds of both wings had incurred fire damage. Only the wing tips and empennage remained undamaged. Examination of the engine revealed that the rear and right side of the engine had incurred fire damage. In addition, the examination showed that there was an opening in the engine case at the No. 4 cylinder position, and the No. 4 connecting rod was protruding through the opening.

The pilot stated that prior to takeoff he added 1.2 quarts of oil to fill the engine oil tank and then did a short test flight over his home airport. After the test flight he found no evidence of engine oil leakage from the engine. At 1250 he departed Parkton for Southern Pines. When about 10 miles from the Southern Pines Airport, the engine began to run rough. He continued toward the airport. The engine oil temperature began to climb and the engine oil pressure began to drop. The engine lost power and they could not make it to the airport. While making a forced landing on a golf course, the left wing collided with a tree and the airplane descended and collided with the ground. Postcrash examination of the airplane by an FAA Inspector showed the propeller had damage consistent with very slow rotational speed at ground impact. The engine cowling and bottom side of the engine had oil spray on it. The engine oil tank contained no oil. Examination of the engine by an FAA Inspector at an engine overhaul facility showed the front crankshaft seal was dislodged and allowed oil to escape from the engine at a substantial rate when the engine oil system was pressurized. No obstructions in the engine case vent system were found that would have caused over pressurization of the engine case. The reason for the dislodge crankshaft seal was not determined.","The dislodging of the front crankshaft oil seal for undetermined reasons resulting in loss of engine oil, loss of engine power, and collision with a tree and then the ground during a forced landing."

The pilot stated he departed Fairhope with a planned destination of Monroeville, Alabama. The winds were calm during departure and he took off to the south. After flying about 5 miles toward the destination, the weather became bad and he elected to return to the departure airport. He approached to land to the south and during approach wind gust  from the north increased his touchdown speed. The runway was also wet do to recent rain showers and he had poor braking action. About midway down the runway he realized the airplane was not stopping and he did not have enough runway to abort the landing. He saw cars driving on the highway at the end of the runway. When he reached the end of the runway, he applied full left rudder and full engine power, in an attempt to ground loop the airplane. The airplane turned 90 degrees to the left and slid sideways.

During the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, the pilot felt that the airplane was ""being pulled"" to the left.  As the airplane touched down on runway 27, it veered off the left side, crossed a grass area, and stopped short of an aircraft hangar.  The pilot reported that he checked the windsock prior to takeoff and again before landing, and it indicated wind out of the southwest at about 5-7 knots.  He stated that he normally corrected for a crosswind by ""flying the airplane into the wind.""  He also stated that the airplane veered off the runway as he was repositioning his feet from the rudder pedals to the brake pedals.  The pilot did not report any mechanical deficiencies with the airplane.  He also reported 115 hours of total flight time, 94 of which were in make and model.",The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing.  A factor was the crosswind.

The airplane collided with mountainous terrain during cruise after encountering turbulence and downdrafts associated with mountain wave conditions.  According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot called the Reno Automated Flight Service Station at 0941 and filed an IFR flight plan, then asked for the winds aloft forecast, which was provided.  The pilot did not request any additional weather briefing information for the flight.  No other record was found that the pilot obtained additional weather forecast information from any official source associated with the FAA or the National Weather Service.  At the time of the pilot's call to the Reno AFSS, several AIRMET weather advisories had been issued hours prior detailing warnings for  turbulence and clear icing along the route of flight.  The advisories warned of occasional moderate turbulence below 18,000 feet in moderately strong westerly winds especially in the vicinity of mountainous terrain.  Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) between 18,000 and 40,000 feet was forecast over the area of the accident site due to jet stream wind shear and mountain wave activity. The pilot departed under visual flight rules (VFR) and picked up his instrument flight rules (IFR) clearance en route and climbed to 14,000 feet.  The pilot later asked if he could maintain 12,500 feet.  The controller advised him that the minimum IFR altitude on this segment of his route was 14,000 feet, and the pilot cancelled his IFR flight plan.  The controller advised the pilot that he had lost radar contact, and instructed the pilot to squawk VFR and the pilot acknowledged the transmission.  The last radar target was about 1/2 mile east of Eagle Peak (elevation 9,920 feet) in the Warner Mountains.  Rescuers discovered the wreckage near the crest of Eagle Peak on November 23.  Investigators found no anomalies with the airframe, engines, or propellers that would have precluded normal operation.  The NWS had a full series of AIRMETs current over the proposed route of flight, which included mountain obscuration, turbulence, and icing.  Analysis of the weather conditions disclosed a layer between 9,500 and 11,000 feet over the accident site area as having a high likelihood of severe or greater turbulence.  A pilot on the same route of flight reported at 1127 that he was in instrument conditions at 11,000 feet, and experiencing light turbulence and light clear icing conditions.  He also reported encountering updrafts of 2,000 feet per minute, which was indicative of mountain wave activity.  A company pilot was in a second Aero Commander trailing the accident airplane and he reported that at 1147, at a position near the accident site, he encountered a severe downdraft.  He applied full climb power, but as the airplane passed over the accident site position, the airplane continued to lose altitude even at maximum power.  At 1159, he was able to gain altitude, and return to his assigned cruising altitude of 14,000 feet.  The second Aero Commander was turbocharged, the accident airplane was not.  Analysis showed that the topography of the area was critical in this case, given that the accident site was at an elevation of 9,240 feet on the eastern slope of Eagle Peak.  The accident airplane's flight track was normal along the airway until immediately downwind of the higher terrain.  As the flight approached the lee side of the mountain, it came under the influence of the mountain wave and first encountered an updraft and then a downdraft, which increased in amplitude as the flight progressed towards Eagle Peak.  Eagle Peak was the tallest point along the Warner Mountain range and the steep slope of this terrain was significant when the mountain wave action was encountered.  Such terrain features have been known to enhance the vertical downdrafts and updrafts associated with the most intense mountain wave turbulence.","the pilot's encounter with forecast mountain wave conditions, moderate or greater turbulence, and icing, with downdrafts that likely exceeded the climb capability of the airplane, which was encountered at an altitude that precluded recovery.  Also causal in the accident was the failure of the pilot to obtain an adequate preflight weather briefing which would have included a series of Airmets that were in effect at the time."

The pilot said he had been airborne for about 3 hours and 15 minutes, and after having descended from 7,000 feet, just before reaching his assigned altitude of 5,000 feet, as he manipulated the throttle control to increase engine power, ""the throttle had no effect, and the engine appeared to be generating no power.""  The pilot said that he performed the emergency procedures, declared an emergency, and made a gear up landing, about 100 feet short of the runway. According to the pilot, an examination of the aircraft  determined that  the right main fuel tank had less than 2 gallons of fuel remaining. He said that he had been operating the aircraft on the right main tank when the engine had ceased operating.  He also said that the left main fuel tank had over 20 gallons of fuel remaining. A licensed FAA aircraft mechanic examined the aircraft and found that it had incurred substantial damege. The mechanic also stated that he found a maximum of about a half of a gallon of fuel remaining in the right main tank, along with debris, and about 18 gallons of fuel remaining in the left tank. According to the mechanic, a detailed examination did not reveal any malfunctions to the aircraft's induction, fuel or ignition systems.","the pilot's failure to properly manage the available fuel in all fuel tanks, which resulted in the loss of engine power due to fuel starvation, a forced landing, and damage to the aircraft when the proper touch down point was not attained."

After the pilot requested a decent from his cruising altitude, he was instructed to squawk 1200 and switch to the advisory frequency at the destination airport; however, the pilot did not acknowledge the instruction.  No further radio transmissions were received from the airplane.  Witnesses reported observing the airplane descend to the water in a straight and level attitude, with the engines developing power.  The airplane wreckage was located in 11 feet of water, about 5 miles south of destination airport.  Review of radar data revealed that the airplane was descending at a rate of about 300 feet per minute, on a heading of about 190 degrees.  The average groundspeed of the airplane during the descent was about 163 knots.  The airplane was equipped with an autopilot.  Examination of the autopilot annunciator panel by the Safety Board Materials laboratory revealed that the autopilot annunciator panel contained 15 indicators, each of which had one 28 Volt 60 milliamp light bulb.  The filaments of each light bulb were examined with a binocular microscope with magnifications of up to 30X.  Three of the filaments were stretched and deformed: ""AP"" (autopilot engagement), ""FD"" (flight director mode), and ""HDG"" (heading select/preselect mode).

About 2 hours and 15 minutes into the flight, the engine started to run rough and lose power.  Initially, engine rpm dropped about 75 rpm.  As engine power continued to decrease, the pilot checked both magnetos, turned the carburetor heat ""ON,"" and checked the fuel selector, which was in the ""Both"" position.  He insured that the primer was in, and set the mixture to full rich, the throttle to full open, and the boost pump to ""ON.""  Once engine power had decayed to approximately 1,900 rpm, the pilot initiated a descent to maintain airspeed.  About 1,500 feet agl, the engine completely lost power.  The airplane impacted a tree, and came to a stop.  Examination of the engine revealed all of the valves were fouled with a ""glass"" like material.

The private pilot departed the home base airport at an unknown time for a day VFR flight in the single-engine airplane to his destination airport.  About 37 nautical miles from the destination airport, the pilot requested and received an in-flight weather briefing.  About 10 miles west of the destination airport, the pilot contacted ATC, the airplane was radar identified, the pilot was assigned a transponder squawk and given the altimeter setting.  The pilot acknowledged the controller's transmissions.  Radar contact was lost, and no additional radio communications with the pilot were recorded.  The pilot's third class medical certificate application (December 19, 1991) indicated 1,500 hours flight time, and the third class medical certificate was issued with the limitation: ""must have available glasses for near vision.""  FAA records did not reveal any evidence that the 76-year old pilot held a current medical certificate.  No evidence was found that the pilot had not obtained sufficient rest before the flight.  There was no evidence found to either suggest a medical cause for incapacitation or to rule out incapacitation for medical reasons.  All of the aircraft was accounted for in the wreckage debris.  No evidence of an in-flight fire and/or explosion, or in-flight mechanical and/or flight control malfunction was found that would have rendered the airplane uncontrollable prior to the impact.

The pilot was flying the airplane in cruise flight at 4,500 feet, when the engine began to shake and lost partial power.  The pilot elected to divert to a nearby airport and troubleshot the loss of engine power by adjusting the mixture and turning on the carburetor heat.  He reported that the engine regained power; however, it lost total power shortly thereafter.  The pilot did not think he would be able to make it to the airport, so he elected to land in a field.  During the landing roll, the nose landing gear contacted a rut in the field, and the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted.  According to the operator, they found ""plenty of fuel onboard the airplane.""  A mechanic, who examined the engine after the accident, reported no anomalies with the engine.  At the time of the accident, the temperature was reported as 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees Fahrenheit), and the dew point as 14 degrees Celsius (57 degrees Fahrenheit).

A commercial pilot, who observed the airplane during the takeoff attempt, stated that it used ""lots"" of runway, and that the nose lifted ""too early and way too slow.""  The airplane ""struggled"" to get in the air, and it appeared tail heavy, with ""extreme"" pitch, about 45 degrees nose-up.  It also appeared that the only thing keeping the nose up was ground effect.  The airplane became airborne for ""a very short time,"" then sank to the ground, and veered off the left side of the runway.  The nose was ""up"" the whole time, the airplane never ""rolled off on a wing,"" and the wings never wobbled.  The engines were ""really loud,"" like a ""shriek,"" and engine noise was ""continuous until impact.""  Another witness at a different location confirmed the extreme nose-high takeoff attitude and the brief time the airplane was airborne.  It seemed odd to him that an airplane with that much power used so much runway.   A runway inspection revealed no evidence of foreign objects or aircraft debris.  Tire tracks from the airplane's main landing gear veered off the left side of the paved surface, at a 20-degree angle, about 3,645 feet from the runway's approach end.  They continued for about 775 feet, then turned back to parallel the runway for another 650 feet, before ending about 50 feet prior to a chain link fence.  There was no evidence that the nose wheel was on the ground prior to the fence.  The fence, which was about 1,300 feet along the airplane's off-runway ground track and 200 feet to the left of the runway edge stripe, was bent over in the direction of travel.  Ground scars began about 150 feet beyond the fence, and the main wreckage came to rest 300 feet beyond the beginning of the ground scars.   The first officer advised a witness that he'd be making the takeoff; however, the pilot at the controls during the accident sequence could not be confirmed.  When asked prior to the flight if he'd be making a high-performance takeoff, the captain replied that he didn't know.

According to information obtained from the FAA, a visual flight rules flight plan had been filed, and the pilot had requested and was receiving VFR flight following. The FAA transcript of communications showed that on November 22, 2001, at 1025, shortly after departing from Wilson Industrial Air Center, Wilson, North Carolina, the pilot had initiated radio communications with Seymour Johnson Air Force Base (AFB) Approach Control.   As the flight progressed, communications control had been passed from Seymour Johnson Approach Control, to Fayetteville Approach Control,  to Myrtle Beach Approach Control, to Charleston Approach Control. At 1223, the pilot  was handed off from Charleston Approach Control to Beaufort  Approach Control, and at 1224, the pilot had checked in with Beaufort approach controller, saying that he was at 8,800 feet, and climbing. He then requested to climb to 10,500 feet, to remain clear of clouds, and was given clearance to do so. At 1238, the pilot stated that he had been trying to get above the clouds nice Charleston, and that he was presently at 10,500 feet, and asked if there were any reports on the cloud coverage. He also said that at that time the clouds appeared to be at 10,300 feet. At 1248, the pilot  was instructed to contact Jacksonville Center on 126.75 mHZ, and he acknowledged the frequency change. At 1249, the pilot made initial contact with the Jacksonville Center Brunswick radar sector controller, reporting that he was at 10,300 feet. The controller responded with the Brunswick altimeter setting, and informed the pilot to remain VFR at all times. The pilot did not respond. Radar data showed that at 1248,  the airplane was at an altitude of 10,700 feet, and at 1250, when the airplane was last seen on radar, it had descended to an altitude of 7000 feet, and was in geographic position 32 degrees 06 minutes 58 seconds north latitude, 080 degrees 23 minutes 13 seconds  west longitude There were no subsequent radar contacts or voice communications with the flight. According to information obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard, at 1347, the U.S. Coast Guard received initial notification of the downed airplane and diverted a search and rescue asset to initiate a search. On November 23, 2001, about 0758, a U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue asset observed and recovered airplane related debris floating in the Atlantic Ocean, in position 32 degrees, 01.5 minutes north latitude, 080 degrees, 29.4 minutes west longitude. Airplane related debris was also retrieved in the vicinity of Sea Pines, Hilton Head, South Carolina, and the retrieved debris was examined by an FAA licensed aviation mechanic. The examination revealed that the wreckage was consistent with portions of a Mooney M20. According to the mechanic, fragmented sections of the right wing rear spar at the aileron bellcrank exhibited 60 percent damage due to rot, and the left wing's rear spar at the aileron bell crank exhibited 75 percent damage due to rot. The NTSB conducted a meteorological study of weather in the vicinity of the accident site, and the study revealed the presence of clouds with bases of about 3,500 feet, and an overcast layer with tops of about 11,000 to 13,000 feet, The study also revealed the possibility of light to moderate turbulence and light precipitation within clouds.

The pilot stated that  he was performing left turns at an altitude of 900 feet, and when he tried to correct for a left bank, he was unable to do so. He said he was able to make pitch control changes, but was unable to recover from the left bank because the control had jammed. He said that the aircraft then entered a spin, and descended, crashing upside down into a lake. According to an FAA inspector who conducted the postcrash investigation, when he interviewed the pilot, the pilot said that the aircraft was at an altitude of about 700 to 900 feet, and his passenger who was seated in the front next to him, was asleep. The inspector said that  the pilot further stated that during attempts to apply a control input to stop the left turn, the control yoke became jammed. The inspector said his examination of the accident aircraft showed that the impact had separated the wings from the rest of the fuselage, but that the flight control system exhibited damage consistent with overstress, and there was no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunction to the flight control system.

The flight instructor stated that he and the dual student were performing autorotations, and the student flared the helicopter at an altitude of about 65 feet, and applied initial collective pitch control input at about 10 feet, leveling the helicopter. The instructor said that the aircraft was about 2 feet high, and still moving forward, and at that point the student did not let the helicopter settle to the ground, but continued to apply collective pitch control input. He said he stopped the student from applying collective pitch control input and the aircraft descended, but during the descent the student applied aft cyclic control input, causing the aircraft to hit on the heels of the skids, while rotor rpms were low. The instructor said, that as a result,  the main rotor blades contacted the tail boom, severing the tail just forward of the tail rotor gear box.","The flight instructor's improper supervision of  the dual student during a practice autorotation landing by allowing an excessive aft pitch attitude and  low main rotor rpm conditions to develop during the landing/flare touchdown, which resulted in the helicopter making a hard landing on the heels of the skids, and the main rotor severing the tail boom."

The pilot stated they flew from Niagara Falls, New York, to Hickory, North Carolina. At Hickory, he had all 4 fuel tanks filled to the top.  After takeoff from Hickory, they climbed to 8,500 feet. Takeoff and climb was performed using the main or tip fuel tanks. After using about 40 gallons from each main tank, he switched the fuel selectors to the inboard or auxiliary tanks. He then climbed to 9,500 feet. When he had used all but about 2 or 3 gallons from the inboard tanks, he switched the fuel selectors back to the main fuel tanks. After about 15 to 20 minutes the engines began to surge and lose power. He contacted the air traffic controller and  they  directed him towards the Reidsville Airport. He moved the engine throttle controls to idle and began the descent for landing. He entered downwind for runway 29 at Reidsville, with both propellers wind milling. When he turned on base leg, he lowered the landing gear. Upon turning to final approach, he realized he could not make the runway. The engines had no power and he placed the propeller controls into the feathered position. Just prior to the landing flare, the airplane did not respond to control inputs. The airplane touched down hard, right wing low, and an explosion occurred in the right wing area. The airplane slid about 100 feet and an explosion occurred in the left wing area. When the airplane came to a stop, they exited the airplane. Post crash examination of the airplane at the crash site was performed by an FAA Inspector and representatives of Cessna Aircraft and Teledyne Continental Motors. Both engine fuel selectors were found on the auxiliary fuel tank position. The auxiliary fuel tanks were not breached by impact forces or the post crash fire, and they contained no usable fuel. The main fuel tanks had separated from the airplane and were damaged by the post crash fire. The left propeller was in the feathered position, and the right propeller was in the low pitch position. The engines were removed from the aircraft after recovery and placed on an engine test stand. The left engine was operated to 1,700 rpm with no evidence of failure or malfunction.  A higher power was not obtained do to a fuel leak at the No. 5 induction tube do to impact damage. The right engine was operated to full power with no evidence of failure or malfunction. Fueling personnel at Hickory, North Carolina, stated that they completely filled all 4 fuel tanks on the airplane with 100 low lead fuel, at the request of the pilot, prior to the airplane departing. They stated they had no reports from pilots of other airplanes that had been fueled before or after N1840H about problems with the fuel.","Improper fuel management by the pilot resulting in loss of power in both engines, and the pilots lowering of the landing gear prior to having the runway made resulting in a hard landing short of the runway."

The pilot reported that this was his second touch-and-go landing of the flight.  He reported that shortly after touchdown, during the landing roll, he felt a ""…hard jolt"" and his foot inadvertently slipped off the right rudder pedal.  He stated that before he could regain control of the airplane, it departed the left side of the runway and encountered soft, wet terrain.  After encountering the soft terrain, the airplane's right main gear collapsed and the right wing impacted the ground.  In a subsequent written report, the pilot reported that the hard jolt was a result of the airplane encountering standing water on the runway.",Directional control not maintained during the landing roll.  Factors include main gear overload and standing water on the runway.

The personal flight impacted terrain in a residential neighborhood about one mile north of the departure airport while executing an emergency return to the airport.  The airplane impacted a wooded area in a 20-degree nose down trajectory and came to rest about 142 feet from the initial impact point.  The pilot reported smoke in the cockpit 55 seconds after takeoff which was then followed by a report of a fire 32 seconds later.  A witness reported seeing gray and black smoke trailing from the right side of the exhaust area.  Inspection of the wreckage revealed that the turbocharger exhaust V-band clamp was separated through the band.  Metallurgical examination indicated that the separation was consistent with a fatigue fracture.  According to maintenance records, the V-band clamp was installed in 1990 in response to a service letter (SL).  An airworthiness directive (AD) was then issued in 1991 requiring the replacement of the V-band clamp with one which was of the same part number as called for by the SL.  The V-band clamp found in the wreckage of the accident airplane was of the same part number required by the SL and AD.  The airplane received an annual inspection 25 days prior to the accident at which time the V-band clamp would have accumulated a total time in service of 1,402 hours.  Engine overhauls and exhaust system related maintenance has necessitated the clamp's repeated removal and installation since its original installation.  According to the airplane emergency procedures for smoke/fire, the master switch and fuel selector valve are to be selected to the off positions.  Radio transmissions by the flight continued after the initial report of smoke.  Inspection of the wreckage revealed that the fuel selector valve was selected to the right fuel tank.",The fatigue failure of the turbocharger exhaust band clamp and aircraft control not possible by the pilot due to the fire.

The airplane veered off the runway and impacted a runway distance sign during the landing.  The airplane was on final approach to the destination airport when the pilot extended the flaps and lost control of the airplane.  The airplane slowed and drifted to the left.  The pilot added power for a go-around; however, the airplane touched down to the left of the runway centerline approximately 1,000 feet from the approach end of the runway.  The pilot reduced engine power, but the airplane continued to the left, exiting the runway surface where it impacted a runway distance marker.  The airport manager observed a ""moderate amount of rime ice"" on the wing leading edges, propeller spinners, and airplane radome immediately after the accident.  According to the pilot, the ice was approximately 1/8 inch in thickness.  The pilot also reported no mechanical anomalies with the airplane.  The FAA's advisory circular regarding icing indicates that even a small amount of ice on the leading edge of the wing can reduce the stall angle of attack and increase stall speed.","The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his failure to maintain directional control.    Contributing factors were the icing conditions, icing, and the improper use of the anti-ice/deicing equipment."

The airplane impacted terrain following a loss of engine power during a go-around on final approach.  The check airman, who was giving a multiengine check ride to a private pilot, asked the pilot to conduct a short field landing.  The check airman believed that they were too low while on final approach, with the landing gear and flaps extended.  He asked the pilot if he thought everything was O.K.  The pilot did not respond, so the check airman initiated a go-around by applying full power and retracting the landing gear.  During the application of power for the go-around, the left engine failed to produce full power.  The airplane veered to the left and its left wing impacted the ground.  Pertinent sections of the pilot's operating handbook for the Beech B95 were reviewed.  The recommended approach speed for a short field landing is 82 mph indicated airspeed, while best single engine rate of climb airspeed (Vyse) is 100 mph indicated.  The procedure specified for a single engine go-around is as follows:  1) Apply full power to operating engine; 2) retract landing gear and close cowl flaps on dead engine; 3) retract flaps to half extension initially, then fully retract the flaps as soon as practical thereafter.  The single engine rate of climb chart predicts a 160-foot-per-minute positive climb at the pressure altitude and temperature existing at the accident site; however, this performance is predicated on the airplane being in the following configuration:  1) at Vyse; 2) gear and flaps retracted; 3) inoperative engine's propeller feathered; 4) 5-degree bank into the operating engine.  Any deviation from the listed single engine climb configuration would result in a degradation of the climb performance.  Given that the airplane was likely in an energy deficient state some 15 to 18 mph below best single engine climb airspeed and not in the proper configuration for a single engine go-around when the loss of power in the left engine became apparent, a successful outcome for the maneuver was in doubt.  The aircraft and left engine were examined by FAA inspectors with assistance by certificated mechanics; however, the reason for the left engine's failure to respond could not be determined.",the loss of engine power in the left engine for undetermined reasons.  A contributing factor was the check pilot's failure to completely configure the airplane for a single engine go-around in a timely way.

Before takeoff, the main fuel tank of the left wing was topped off and 7 gallons of fuel were added to the main fuel tank of the right wing.  The left seat occupant (owner of a Grumman AA5 and a CFI) reported he had never flown the accident make and model airplane before and wanted a pilot familiar with the airplane to fly with him; as such the right seat occupant was pilot-in-command (PIC).  The right seat occupant stated that he went along on the flight because the left seat occupant had not flown the airplane in some time, and he assumed the left seat occupant was PIC.  Each occupant says the other performed a preflight of the airplane.  The left seat occupant reported that both flew the airplane at various times during the flight.   The right seat occupant reported he never touched the controls at any time during the flight.  The flight departed, proceeded to the practice area where slow flight was performed.  The flight then proceeded to the Pompano Beach Airpark Airport where 1 full stop landing was performed.  The flight taxied back, departed, and remained in the traffic pattern where 2 touch-and-go (T & G) landings were performed.  The left seat occupant stated that at 200 feet during the climbout of the second T & G landing, the engine began to run rough.  He looked at the right seat occupant who appeared ""frozen"", and took the controls.  The engine was developing some power and he banked the airplane in an attempt to return to the airport with the recognition that if the engine quit, he would roll the airplane to a wings level and land straight ahead.  The next thing he recalls, they had crashed.  Two air traffic controllers reported observing the wings rocking during the upwind leg, one reported seeing the airplane in a sharp right turn.  Fire rescue from a station immediately adjacent to the airport did not respond; other stations responded.  The  fire rescue report indicates that the right seat occupant reported the left seat occupant was flying the airplane.  Examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction of the fuel vent or supply system.  The carburetor heat control was found in the midrange position; however, the airbox was impact damaged.  The carburetor heat control cable was separated from the control arm; incorrect securing hardware was noted.  Examination of the flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  The engine was removed from the airplane and placed on a test stand where it was noted to operate normally; no discrepancies were noted during the engine run.  Testing of fuel from the source that fueled the airplane revealed no discrepancies.","The failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain airspeed (Vs),  while maneuvering for an emergency landing, resulting in an inadvertent stall and subsequent in-flight collision with terrain.  A contributing factor in the accident was the loss of engine power due to undetermined reasons."

The helicopter was fueled to capacity the evening before, and the engine compartment was preheated before departure. Preflight inspection revealed no frost on the airframe or rotor blades. The particle separator was clean and dry. Engine start and takeoff were normal. After crossing a highway 1/2 mile south from the heliport, at an airspeed ""in excess of 50 mph [and] at an altitude of approximately 50-70 feet,"" the engine ""flamed out."" There was a noticeable yaw and the pilot heard ""the sound of the engine shutting off."" He autorotated towards a highway right-of-way. The helicopter struck the ground hard and slid 20 to 30 feet. ""Mast bumping"" broke the rotor head off. It struck the rear of the helicopter, severing the tail section. The helicopter spun around and rolled over on its right side. Postaccident examination disclosed no fuel remaining because the rear skid leg had punctured the fuel tank. The pilot and his two passengers had been drenched with fuel when they evacuated the helicopter. All fuel lines and fuel filter were intact, free of debris, and contained fuel. The turbine and compressor turned freely by hand. The pilot said he noted dirt on the inside of the cap ""consistent with the dirt at the crash site."" Later, he wrote that ""the dirt on the inside of the fuel cap was orange, the same color as at the heliport. The dirt at the crash site is more brown native soil.""

The helicopter touched down on the soft grassy area and slid for approximately 10 feet before starting to nose over.  ""The tail of the helicopter pitched upward into the blades, severing it.""  The helicopter rotated left approximately 270 degrees before coming to rest upright.  The flight instructor stated that ""weather had saturated the ground and caused the sod to be soft on the usual landing area.

The airplane lost power on final approach for landing and impacted rocky terrain about 1/4 mile from the approach end of the runway.  The pilot stated that he was flying to local airports.  The plan was to do a touch-and-go landing and then depart.  He noted no discrepancies until the second leg of the flight when he was on final.  He had setup for landing, which included reducing power and adding carburetor heat.  On final he smelled fuel.  He noted that an existing headwind had put the airplane farther back on the approach than he had expected, and he realized that he was not going to make the runway.  The pilot advanced the throttle, but did not receive a corresponding power output from the engine.  The airplane came to rest in rocky terrain.  Later examination of the carburetor float revealed that it was cracked and full of fuel.  Furthermore, fuel was leaking around the mixture control, accelerator pump, and in the idle tube area of the carburetor.",a loss of engine power due to a crack in the carburetor float and leaking portions of the carburetor that resulted in an overly rich mixture.

After flying for 2 hours the airplane arrived at the destination airport.  Upon entering the traffic pattern the left seated pilot performed a prelanding check.  However, he did not reposition the fuel tank selector from the nearly empty right auxiliary fuel tank to a main tank.  Seconds after turning onto the final approach leg, the pilot performed another prelanding check.  Again, he did not reposition the fuel tank selector away from the right auxiliary tank.  Seconds thereafter, the engine sputtered and lost all power.  The pilot then tried to reposition the fuel tank selector, but the pilot-rated passenger had already accomplished that task.  Engine power was restored just prior to the airplane impacting a berm, about 500 feet short of the runway.  The left seated pilot held commercial and certified flight instructor certificates.  He had about 612 total flight hours including 32 hours in Comanches.  The right seated pilot-rated passenger also held commercial and certified flight instructor certificates.  He had about 1,740 total flight hours, including 40 hours in Comanches.  The subsequent airplane examination revealed that the left auxiliary fuel tank and the two main tanks jointly contained a total of 50 gallons of fuel.  The right auxiliary fuel tank was dry.","Fuel starvation on final approach due to the pilot's fuel mismanagement, and his inattentiveness in following established prelanding procedures."

The flight departed from Little Rock, Arkansas, about 2356 cst, and approximately 49 minutes after takeoff, the FAA approved un-augmented Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS-3) installed at the destination airport began reporting the visibility as 1/4 statute mile; the visibility continued to be reported as that value for several hours after the accident.  Title 14 CFR Part 135.225 indicates no pilot may begin an instrument approach procedure to an airport with an approved  weather reporting facility unless the latest weather report issued by that weather reporting facility indicates that weather conditions are at or above the authorized IFR landing minimums for that airport.  The listed minimums for the ILS approach to runway 05 was in part 3/4 mile visibility.  A METAR taken at the destination airport approximately 2 minutes after the accident indicated overcast clouds existed at 100 feet, the temperature and dew point were 4 and 2 degrees Celsius, respectively, and the altimeter setting was 30.16 inHg.  No precipitation was present across Arkansas, Mississippi, or Alabama, and no radar echoes were noted along the accident airplane's route of flight.  The freezing level near the departure and destination airports at the nominal time of 0600 (4 hours 17 minutes after the accident) was 12000 and 14,500 feet mean sea level, respectively.  A witness at the airport reported the fog was the thickest he had seen since working at the airport for the previous year.  The flight was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 05, and the pilot was advised frequency change was approved.  The witness waiting at the airport reported hearing a sound he associated with a shotgun report.  Radar data indicated that between 0138:47, and 0142:11, the airplane was flying on a northeasterly heading and descended from 2,400 feet msl, to 900 feet msl.  At 0142:11, the airplane was located .43 nautical mile from the approach end of runway 05.  The next recorded radar target 24 seconds later indicated 1,000 feet msl, and was .20 nautical mile from the approach end of runway 05.  The touchdown zone elevation for runway 05 is 700 feet msl.  The airplane crashed in a wooded area located approximately 342 degrees and .37 nautical mile from the approach end of runway 05; the wreckage was located approximately 4 hours after the accident.  Examination of trees revealed evidence the airplane was banked to the left approximately 24 degrees, and the descent angle from the trees to the ground was calculated to be approximately 22 degrees.  All components necessary to sustain flight were either attached to the airplane or in close proximity to the main wreckage.  There was no evidence of post crash fire and a strong odor of fuel was noted at the scene upon NTSB arrival.  A 8-inch diameter pine tree located near the initial ground impact sight exhibited black paint transfer and a smooth cut surface that measured approximately 46 inches in length.  The bottom portion of the cut was located 4 feet above ground level.  The flap actuator was found nearly retracted; examination of the components of the flap system revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the flight control system for roll, pitch, and yaw revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the engine and engine components with TSB of Canada oversight revealed no evidence of preimpact failure of the engine or engine components.  Examination of the propeller with FAA oversight revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the components of the autopilot system, selected avionics and flight instruments from the airplane with FAA oversight revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  The pilot's attitude indicator had been replaced on October 14, 2001, and according to FAA personnel, the mechanic and facility that performed the installation did not have the necessary equipment to perform the operational checks required to return the airplane to service.  The FAA flight checked the ILS approach to runway 05 two times after the accident and reported no discrepancies.","The poor in-flight planning by the pilot-in-command for his initiation of the ILS approach to runway 05 with weather conditions below minimums for the approach contrary to the federal aviation regulations, and the failure of the pilot to maintain control of the airplane during a missed approach resulting in the in-flight collision with trees then terrain."

The airplane collided with the ground in a steep nose down attitude at high speed.  There were no known witnesses to the accident.  No flight plan had been filed for the personal flight and no records were found of an FAA preflight weather briefing or en route communications with any FAA facility.  The accident site is about 8 miles east of the flight's intended destination airport.  Examination of available weather data disclosed that an unusually strong late fall weather system was affecting the general accident site area.  Overcast clouds were banked over the Sierra Nevada foothills and consisted of a southwest-northeast oriented cloud band with scattered light rain showers present in the accident area.  Cloud bases were probably 1,000 to 2,000 feet above ground level, and cloud tops were probably around 16,000 feet msl.  Winds and temperatures at the accident airplane's estimated flight envelope of 3,000 to 4,500 feet msl were southwesterly at 30 knots and 34 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively.  The freezing level in the accident area was about 5,000 feet msl with the possibility of moderate to severe mixed icing conditions above that altitude.  The presence of a light rain shower near the accident site and an upslope flow condition indicated that super cooled large water droplets were likely present in the area.  Occasional moderate turbulence was likely in the area with severe turbulence possible near convective activity.  A deputy sheriff patrolling near the accident site reported that at the time of the accident there was heavy rain and wind.  Local accident area residents reported that they were experiencing strong winds and heavy rain with lightning and thunder at the time of the accident.

The airplane impacted the ocean in an uncontrolled descent after experiencing a loss of control while maneuvering.  The certified flight instructor (CFI) demonstrated a 4-point roll and transferred control of the airplane to the pilot under instruction (PUI) so that he could demonstrate the maneuver.  Shortly after transferring control, the airplane's nose pitched down 20-30 degrees.  The PUI asked the CFI if he was causing the nose to pitch down, to which the CFI responded in the negative.  The CFI attempted to correct the nose down pitch but the control stick had no effect and the trim would not budge.  Both the CFI and the PUI bailed out of the airplane before it impacted the ocean.  The airplane was not recovered, and the reason for the loss of control was not determined.",the loss of aircraft control while maneuvering for undetermined reasons.

During a hovering passenger pickup, the helicopter rolled over and collided with the ground.  The purpose of the flight was to pickup a work crew and transfer them to another location.  When the helicopter arrived at the pickup location, the pilot radioed the crew that he wanted them to board the helicopter from the left side.  When the first man boarded the helicopter, it was from the right side, and he did not change his seat position to the opposite side.  According to the pilot, as the second man was boarding, the helicopter began to ""sway"" back and forth.  He released his grip on the helicopter, and was backing away from it when the helicopter impacted the ground on its right side.  The work crews stated that the helicopter began ""swaying"" out of control before the second workman reached the helicopter to board.  The work crews had been briefed earlier that day that if the pilot was unable to land due to terrain, the crew would have to exit and enter the helicopter while it was hovered.  The seating arrangement was for the heavier people to sit in the back, with the lighter person seated in the front.  One person was to board at a time, and then move to the opposite side of the helicopter before a second workman boarded.  The last person to enter the helicopter would be the front seat passenger.","The pilot's loss of lateral control while in a hover that resulted in a rollover and collision with the ground.

During an aborted landing attempt, the engine lost power and the airplane impacted soft swampy terrain.  The nose wheel impacted the terrain first and was sheared off.  The airplane came to an abrupt stop, and came to rest upright.  On the approach the student pilot/owner/operator, who was also the pilot flying, moved the fuel selector to the BOTH position.  He did not visually verify the fuel selector's actual position, he did it by feel.  The airplane landed hard and began to porpoise down the runway.  The private pilot, seated in the right seat, took the flight controls from the student pilot and initiated an aborted landing.  He advanced the throttle, and the airplane climbed to 80 feet when the engine quit.  The private pilot aimed the airplane towards the ground to avoid trees situated off the departure end of the runway.  The student pilot refueled the airplane prior to departure, and noted no mechanical anomalies on the return flight.  After the accident, fuel was observed in both fuel tanks.  Due to the nose down, wing low attitude of the airplane on-scene, a determination could not be made as to the amount of fuel on board.  Post accident examination of the airframe and engine disclosed no evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure.  The carburetor heat control was found in the off position.  According to the aviation routine weather report for an airport 10 statute miles from the accident site, the temperature/dew point was 45 degrees and 41 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively.

According to eyewitnesses, the Beech Baron was seen flying in formation, with a Cessna 210 at a low altitude, flying below treetop height and fast.  As the formation neared the airport, the Beech closed in on the Cessna as the number two position in a right echelon.  The pilot of the lead aircraft estimated that their airspeed at the time he executed his pitch-up was about 190 knots. The flight of two appeared to be flying into the ""break,""  military style, for landings on runway 22.  About the mid-point of the 3,000 foot runway,  the lead aircraft executed an abrupt pitch up and left bank, and the Beech continued forward, colliding with a tree at the departure end of the runway.  Some eyewitnesses stated the Beech went inverted following tree strike. The Beech continued airborne until impacting the rear portion of the roof of a two story manufacturing plant and came to rest about 202 feet beyond the building into a tree and vine thicket, and was consumed by post crash fire.

Witnesses observed the airplane's wings rock back and forth prior to the airplane stalling, entering a spin, and impacting terrain during the takeoff initial climb out.  There was a post impact fire.  The airplane was loaded with a pilot, three passengers, luggage, miscellaneous items, and fuel.  A determination of the amount of fuel on board could not be made.  If the airplane took off with full fuel, it would have been over gross weight with the center of gravity outside of the envelope (aft).  With 30 gallons of fuel on board, the airplane would have been within the gross weight; however, it would still have been out of the center of gravity envelope (aft).  The pilot and front seat passenger were fatally injured.  The rear seat passengers survived.  The rear seat passengers indicated that on the morning of the accident the airplane was turned so that the sun could melt the ice on the wings.  They went to eat and when they returned, they noted a layer of 1/4- to 1/2-inch of ice still covering the airplane.  The pilot and two passengers removed some of the ice from the wings and tail sections; however, the rear seat passengers reported that no ladders were used to remove the ice from the tops of the wings.  The weather conditions during the preceding 24 hours were conducive for the formation of frost, snow, and ice on the lifting surfaces of the airplane.  Numerous witnesses observed 1/4- to 1/2-inch of snow and ice on the surfaces of other airplanes parked at various spots on the airport the morning of the accident.  Public deicing facilities were not available at the airport.  Investigators noted no mechanical discrepancies during the engine inspection that would have precluded it from producing power, and no discrepancies were found with the airframe.  Research has shown that that frost, snow, and ice accumulations on the leading edge or upper surface of the wing, no thicker or rougher than a piece of coarse sandpaper, can reduce lift by 30 percent and increase drag up to 40 percent.  Larger accretions [of snow, ice, or frost] can reduce lift even more and can increase drag by 80 percent or more.  Toxicology testing of the pilot's blood detected a prescription antidepressant at a level consistent with routine use and an over-the-counter sedating antihistamine at a level above that expected from a single dose.  The pilot had not reported the use of these medications to the FAA.""","the pilot's failure to adequately deice the airplane prior to takeoff, which resulted in the airplane's degraded aerodynamic and climb performance capability, failure to maintain an adequate airspeed, and a stall/spin.  Contributing factors were the pilot's incorrect weight and balance computations, and his use of an impairing over-the-counter medication."

The witnessed remarked to his wife that the airplane was going to stall, and then he observed the airplane fly directly into the ground.  The pilot was seriously injured, and did not recall the accident.  Examination of the wreckage by an FAA inspector revealed that the right wing aileron cable was not secured in a pulley groove.  However, emergency personnel had severed the wings during the rescue effort, and the FAA inspector could not determine if the cable dislodged before the accident or during the rescue effort.","The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during approach to the airport, which resulted in an inadvertent stall."

The airline completed weight and balance and dispatch release forms for the initial flight showed an incorrect fuel load at the time the engines were started.  The first officer performed a walk-around before the first flight leg which included checking the fuel tanks.  A total of 460 gallons of fuel were added to the fuel tanks, and a delay loading cargo occurred.  After both engines were started to begin the first flight, the engines remained operated for between 9-10 minutes before they were secured due to a radio problem.  Maintenance personnel reracked the VHF radios, and again the engines were started where the airplane remained on the ramp 3-4 minutes before taxiing to the runway.  The airplane remained at the runway hold short area for between 20 and 25 minutes before returning to the ramp due to a radio problem.  The engines were secured, and a new VHF radio was purchased and installed.  The company did not prepare new dispatch release, or weight and balance forms for the flight taking into account the additional fuel consumed with the engines operating.  The engines were started, and the airplane was taxied to the runway and departed for the planned first leg.  The airplane landed uneventfully at the destination airport where the cargo was offloaded.  The first officer performed a walk-around which included checking the fuel tanks; 300 gallons of fuel were added to the fuel tanks (150 gallons in each side).  The flight departed to return and when near the coastline, the flight was vectored to an airport other than the planned destination due to a issue with U.S. Customs.  The flight landed uneventfully, and experienced a delay clearing customs.  While on the ground before departure on the accident flight, the first officer reportedly performed a walk-around which included checking the fuel tanks with the captain looking on.  The first officer reported that each fuel tank had approximately 1,100 pounds of fuel, and he and the captain both agreed before takeoff as to the quantity of fuel on-board as indicated by the magna-sticks.  No fuel was purchased.  Following starting of both engines for the accident flight, the first officer checked the fuel quantity gauges indications against the magna-sticks indications he observed; the fuel quantity gauges indicated approximately 200 pounds more.  The flight departed, proceeded eastbound, and climbed to approximately 2,100 feet msl.  During a right turn from a southeast to westerly heading, the right engine experienced a loss of horsepower which decreased from 900 to zero.  The right engine was secured as a precaution,  and priority handling to the destination airport was requested with air traffic control.  The left engine horsepower remained the same (900) for a period of 31 seconds following the right engine horsepower decrease, then increased to 2,200, and remained at that value for 1 minute 13 seconds.  The left engine horsepower then began to decrease and dropped to zero.  The airplane was turned to the east, then turned to the south and ditched.  The captain and first officer evacuated but remained with the airplane, and made it to shore where the first officer advised his wife that something was wrong with the fuel gauges.  Following recovery of the airplane, pressure testing of the left fuel tank revealed no evidence of preimpact leakage.  Pressure testing of the right fuel tank revealed slight leakage past the fuel cap.  Boroscope examination of the engines, and functional test of each engine ignition system, fuel control units and fuel pumps revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the installed magna-sticks revealed no evidence of preimpact failure.  The left fuel tank was drained and found to contain 2 gallons of Jet A fuel, while the right fuel tank was drained and found to contain approximately 540 gallons of salt water and 1/2 gallon of Jet A fuel.  Fuel consumption calculations performed by FAA personnel revealed that at the time of engine start for the accident flight, the fuel tanks contained approximately 714 pounds of fuel.  According to a representative of the engine manufacturer, the amount of fuel drained from the engine components post accident was consistent with, ""low residual fuel.""","The inadequate dispatch of the airplane by company personnel prior to the first leg of the flight due to failure of company personnel to prepare a new flight release and weight and balance after considerable time on the ground with the engines operating.  Also causal, was the inadequate preflight of the airplane by the captain by which he failed to note the low level of fuel in the fuel tanks before departure resulting in total loss of engine power of both engines due to fuel exhaustion and subsequent ditching of the airplane.  A finding in the accident was the inaccurate fuel quantity gauges."

During the takeoff roll, with the nose wheel elevated and both main wheels still on the runway surface, the aircraft experienced a complete loss of power on the right engine. As the pilot initiated the abort sequence, instead of pulling both throttles to the full idle position, he ""...retarded the left power lever partially."" This action did not sufficiently alleviate the asymmetrical thrust in time for the pilot to keep the aircraft aligned with the runway, and it subsequently departed the right side of the runway surface. As it left the runway at a 30 degree angle and entered terrain partially covered by snow, the pilot noticed the aircraft was heading toward a fence on the airport perimeter. Instead of executing the published abort procedure, he pushed the left power lever back up to the full power position. According to the pilot, he did this in order to store what energy he still had, so that he could raise the nose of the aircraft prior to hitting the fence, ""...thereby impacting the fence with the bottom of the aircraft."" Post accident measurements determined that the aircraft had traveled 425 feet from where it entered the runway to where it departed the side of the runway surface. It traveled another 670 feet prior to impacting the fence. After breaking off six of the fence support poles, and bending four others over, it traveled another 196 feet before coming to a stop. A post-accident inspection of the aircraft and its systems did not reveal any malfunctions or anomalies that would have contributed to a loss of engine power.","The pilot's improper abort procedure and inadequate remedial action, leading to a loss of directional control after losing power in one engine during the takeoff roll. Factors include the loss of power from one engine, and a fence around the perimeter of the airport."

The pilot departed on a pleasure flight and was approaching his destination.  He intended to land on runway 20, a 2,350 foot-long, 125 foot wide turf strip.  When he arrived at the airport, the wind sock was straight out in a direct crosswind to the runway.  While on approach to land, the pilot stated that he was ""slipping in.""  He added that  while on final he was too low, and he realized that he was going to hit the trees.  He leveled the wings, and ""clipped"" the trees.  The airplane was spun 180 degrees, and came to rest on the ground.  The pilot reported that it had been about 6 years since his most recent biennial flight review, and about 7 years since his last FAA medical examination.  A weather observation, at an airport about 15 miles from the accident site included winds from 290 degrees at 15 knots, gusting to 23 knots.","The pilot's failure to maintain proper altitude clearance while landing, which resulted in a collision with trees.

According to eyewitnesses to the landing, the twin Rotax powered, pusher configured, 2-place light experimental aircraft's landing touchdown occurred about 130 feet down the 600-foot private grass runway. After touchdown, the left wing dropped, and a small puff of dust was observed under the left wing as in something dragging concurrently with commencement of a left drift. A go around attempt was heard and observed, and the left wing collided with a fence pole on the left runway edge at about 336 feet down the runway. Following the fence pole collision, the aircraft continued left until small tree collision with the right wing caused a right yaw and a secondary severe, sideward collision between a large tree and the cockpit left side. The day before, the pilot experienced a similar loss of runway directional control and, via an e-mail to a friend following the occurrence, attributed it to either not having both main landing gear firmly on the runway before application of wheel braking, or the difference in wheel-to-surface friction properties while braking. Postcrash examination of the main wheel brakes revealed no locked up condition.","The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing and go-around, resulting in a collision with a runway perimeter fence pole and trees."

The student pilot landed the Cessna (N48727) on runway 36R.  She was advised by the local controller to exit the runway with a right turn at the next taxiway, which was taxiway Juliet, and to ""keep taxiing, come up on ground.""  However, she stopped the airplane just past the hold short line on taxiway Juliet to perform her after landing checklist.  After completing the checklist, she switched frequencies to ground control, but had not yet called the ground controller when her airplane's tail section was struck by the Helldiver's (N92879) propeller.  The Helldiver was the first of three vintage aircraft to land on runway 36L and was held short of runway 36R on taxiway Juliet, due to the Cessna landing on 36R.  According to the Helldiver pilot, ""several minutes"" after the Cessna had cleared runway 36R, he was cleared by ground control to taxi, via taxiway Juliet and Charlie, to parking.  The Helldiver crossed runway 36R, and the Helldiver's propeller impacted the right elevator, right horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer, and the rudder of the stopped Cessna.  The pilot of the Helldiver reported that he did not perform S-turns during the taxi, since the ""taxiways are too narrow.""  Review of audio tapes revealed that there was a duty transfer between two ground controllers after the Cessna and Helldiver landed, but prior to the Helldiver receiving taxi instructions.  The review also indicated that neither the local controller, nor either ground controller, attempted to contact the Cessna after the local controller issued the initial taxi instruction.",the Helldiver pilot's failure to maintain visual separation with the Cessna while taxiing.

The pilot said that the copilot was flying a visual approach to runway 15 at the Lawrence Municipal Airport, Lawrence, Kansas.  The pilot said, ""With gear down and full flaps at approximately 15 to 20 feet above the runway and 115 KTS, the nose abruptly dropped and there was no elevator effectiveness with the yoke pulled back to the mechanical stop.""  The pilot said, ""After landing, I noticed that the stabilizer trim indicated full nose down in the cockpit and, upon exterior inspection, the stab was in that position.""  The copilot said, ""I made my turn to base and proceeded to make my turn to final.  No problems with the controllability were noted at this time.  The turn to final was made and the airplane was lined up with the runway on final approach with normal glide path.  My altitude was dropping normally and my airspeed was approx[imately] 140 knots.""  The copilot said, ""When it got time to pull the power back to idle for landing our airspeed was approx[imately] 110 knots and power was reduced.  At that point in time the nose of the aircraft seemed to pitch over towards the runway and increase speed.  I pulled back on the yoke to raise the nose and at that same instance the pilot recognized the pitch over and pulled back on the yoke at the same time.  The yoke did not seem to pull all of the way to its full extent of travel and felt to mechanically stop at about 3/4 the way travel.  Even with both pilot's pulling on the yoke it seemed unresponsive and failed to raise the nose back to a proper landing attitude.

The airplane collided with a runway end identifier light control box following a loss of control on takeoff.  The pilot reported that his seat slid back on takeoff and because the nose of the airplane was high, his forward visibility was limited.  The pilot reported he felt a couple of ""bumps"".  He then was able to slide the seat forward and abort the takeoff.  The pilot reported that he taxied back to the runway and departed for Kenosha.  He reported the airplane seemed to lack power during the flight.  The pilot reported that he was trying to attach a hand held GPS unit to his leg with a cable when the seat slid back.  He reported that the cable most likely became attached to the seat adjustment lever and this resulted in the lever being moved, and the seat sliding back.  Damage to the airplane included buckling and puncture damage to the lower fuselage, engine cowling, and left horizontal stabilizer, firewall damage, the tip of one propeller was missing and the other propeller tip was damaged, and a section of the exhaust system was crushed.","The pilot inadvertently released the seat adjustment mechanism which resulted in the seat sliding back during takeoff, and his subsequent failure to maintain control of the airplane.

The pilot rented the airplane and did not fill the fuel tanks prior to taking off for a planned round-robin flight between the islands of Oahu and Lanai.  The pilot spent about 30 minutes on the ground at Lanai during which time he did not check the quantity of fuel in the tanks.  No fuel was obtained at Lanai, and the pilot attempted to fly back to Oahu.  After flying a total of approximately 1.9 hours, fuel starvation occurred about 8 miles east of the pilot's intended destination, the Honolulu International Airport.  The pilot made a forced landing in a park and during rollout the airplane collided with a mango tree.  During the postimpact airplane examination, the undamaged right wing fuel tank was found containing several drops of fuel.  The damaged (but not breached) left wing fuel tank contained about 1 quart of fuel.

After touchdown, the pilot deployed the thrust reversers and shortly thereafter, the airplane yawed violently to the right.  The pilot maintained control, and the airplane came to a stop on the runway.  Subsequent examination of the airplane revealed that the left engine thrust reverser assembly had separated from the engine and was found on the runway.  Examination of the left thrust reverser outboard pinion gearbox revealed three fatigue bolts, with multiple origins.  A fourth bolt was pulled completely out of the flange and was slightly bent.  The inboard pinion gearbox  was fractured into two parts and contained two regions of fatigue in the rails at the forward flange.  The fatigue features were consistent with low stress high-cycle fatigue.  The left thrust reverser was installed on May 7, 1996.  It was not determined if the left thrust reverser attaching bolts were replaced at that time.

The twin-turbojet, transport-category airplane was destroyed when it departed controlled flight during descent into its final destination and impacted terrain.  The flight was cleared to descend from FL 390 to 10,000 feet, and the flight crew established a 4,000-foot/minute descent.  As the airplane descended through FL 219, air traffic control requested the pilot contact approach control.  However, the pilot read back an incorrect frequency and spoke an unintelligible word.  The controller attempted to correct the pilot; however, no additional communications were received from the flight crew.  Located within a pause in the pilot's last transmission, a 1680 Hz frequency could be heard for 0.1 seconds.  There are only two systems in the airplane with aural warning systems within that frequency range; the cabin altitude warning, and the overspeed warning (both systems were destroyed during the accident sequence).  Shortly after the last transmission from the pilot, radar data depicted the airplane climbing back up to FL 231 before entering a steep and rapid descent.  A performance study indicated that just prior to the loss of control, the airplane exceeded its maximum operating airspeed of 300 knots calibrated.  However, according to the manufacturer, the airplane had been successfully flown at airspeeds up to 400 knots calibrated without loss of control.  The right wing and sections of the right horizontal stabilizer/elevator separated from the airplane just prior to its impact with terrain and were located approximately 200-250 feet from the main impact crater.  No anomalies with the airframe or engine were found that would have led to the loss of control.

The airplane crashed during the missed approach segment of the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 7 at Jacksonville International Airport (JAX). This was the third airport the pilot tried to land after unsuccessful attempts due to low clouds and visibilities at two other airports. During the ILS approach to JAX, the air traffic controller advised the pilot that two flights had landed earlier with each reporting breaking out of the clouds 50 to 100 feet above the decision height and initially only the approach lights being visible. The pilot subsequently radioed he was on a missed approach. The controller, and another flight on the ground later heard a partially unclear transmission with the pilot indicating his instruments were malfunctioning. Witnesses either heard or saw the airplane over fly the airport. Two witnesses stated they heard the sounds of the engine increase and one reported he thereafter heard the airplane turn north, circle several times, and descend followed by the sound of a crash. Recorded radar data indicate that before radar contact was lost the airplane did complete circling turns to the left while at the same time climbing to 1000 feet and then descending to 300 feet. Radar contact of the airplane was lost 2 miles south of the accident site. The airplane crashed in a wooded area and came to rest about 200 feet from the initial tree impact point. The examination of the airplane did not disclose evidence of mechanical malfunction.",The pilot becoming spatially disoriented and losing control of the airplane during a missed approach resulting in the airplane descending uncontrolled and colliding with trees and the ground.

The scheduled domestic passenger carrying flight of a Boeing 737-322 achieved a maximum altitude of about 27,000 feet with an outside air temperature of about  -36 degrees Celsius.  About 30 minutes after departure and while on a visual descent to the destination airport, the flight encountered wake turbulence while descending through 9,300 feet mean sea level for visual approach to the destination airport.  The airplane began a correction back to the right while continuing to bounce.  The airplane rapidly banked 10 degrees when the captain said that he was disengaging the autopilot and autothrottles.  The captain applied left aileron and left rudder to oppose the roll and eventually the first officer began to assist the captain in his control inputs.  

The digital flight data recorder showed that the airplane achieved a right 26-degree roll; a left 45-degree control wheel deflection followed by right control wheel deflections.  The rudder pedal deflection achieved a maximum value of left 6.5 degrees which was followed by a right 1.5 degree deflection with corresponding aileron deflections ranging from left 6.0 degrees to right 1.0 degrees.  The pedal then remained deflected to the left over a range from 2.0-0.25 degrees with corresponding left rudder deflections ranging from 2.0-0.25 degrees until the airplane landed. The first officer reported that  A and B hydraulic quantity and pressure gauge indications were normal and there was no change in hydraulic pressure and quantity indication upon completion of each uncommanded rudder checklist item.  The captain stated that during landing roll, about 100 knots indicated airspeed, they heard a banging noise and got a full right deflection of the rudder pedals.  The cockpit voice recorder recording of the flight was not retained by the operator following the incident.  

Inspection of the cockpit nose area forward of the main landing gear revealed a wood-handled wire brush.   The first officer's pedal arms contained scuff marks on the paint surface and gouge marks which penetrated the paint surface and metal.  Further inspection with the aid of a borescope revealed the presence of displaced white paint on the structure aft of the pedal arms.  No dents were noted in the vertical structure surrounding the pedal arm.  The UAL party representative stated that work relating to an airworthiness directive was performed weeks prior to the incident.  The brush along with a new brush and the first officer's pedal arms were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory for further examination.  Examination of the first officer's rudder pedal arms and brush revealed that in the vicinity of the bolt heads revealed only light score marks scattered around the edge of the boss, consistent with tool usage.  The right pedal arm contained one score mark on the rear edge of the boss.  The score mark was circumferential for approximately 90 degrees of arc, centered at the horizontal line.  It was more significant above the horizontal and tapered to nothing below it.  Examination of the left, right , top, and bottom faces of the brush handle revealed no indications of any crush damage.  Functional testing and macroscopic visual examination of the rudder power control unit revealed no anomalies.  One estimate of the maximum rudder forces that can be exerted for various positions of rudder pedal range from 246 - 424 lbs depending upon rudder pedal position and distance from back of seat.  Several like brushes were loaded in the lengthwise direction and also placed in various obstructive positions within the pedal arms.  Brushes placed in obstructive positions with a pilot applying rudder pressure estimated that force he applied to the rudder pedals to fracture the brushes was 15-20 pounds.  Brushes loaded in the lengthwise directions broke at loadings from a maximum of 80 pounds and below.  A flight training simulator was back driven at UAL's Flight Training Facility using FDR data from the incident flight with both flight crew members aboard. The simulator structure at the rudder pedals had the same platform/shelf structure as the incident airplane.  The rudder pedals set to the same adjustment as reported by the first officer, and the brush was inserted with the application of left rudder pedal pressure to hold the brush in place due to the resting platform being shorter than the actual airplane.  The brush position for the best strength and holding power was noted when the brush was orientated such that the wire bristles were facing downward and towards the rudder control arms and the convex portion of the brush handle facing upwards with the other end against the vertical wall of the pedal box.  Further pressure on the rudder pedals was not added due to a concern of causing damage to the simulator.  

A search of the Federal Aviation Administration’s service difficulty reporting system relating to ""Boeing Rudder Controls"" was performed for a time period from January 1, 1997 to February 1, 2002.  One occurrence shows that maintenance could not find any fault with the airplane and that the rudder hydraulic system components were replaced.  A second occurrence shows that after the accomplishment of engineering callouts relating to rudder hydraulic system components, no defects were noted.  A third occurrence noted the replacement of the PCU.",Reason for occurrence is undetermined.

The crew of Douglas DC-8-71F airplane reported a partial flight control malfunction during takeoff.  The captain reported that just after the airplane became airborne, the airplane rolled hard to the left.  He said that he had to apply full right aileron control, in conjunction with right rudder, to keep the airplane from continuing to roll to the left.  The crew immediately declared an in-flight emergency, returned to the airport using left turns only, and made an emergency, high speed landing, without the use of any wing flaps.  After landing, the flight crew discovered that the left wing outboard spoiler had deployed just after takeoff.  A postincident inspection revealed a broken outboard left wing spoiler retraction cable.  An NTSB Metallurgist reported that a magnified optical examination of the broken cable revealed that the area adjacent to the fracture site was severely worn, and reduced in size.  He added that many individual wire strands were worn to a knife-edge.  The remaining broken strands appeared typical of overstress separations, with no indication of external corrosion.  Currently, the subject cable is considered to be an ""on condition"" component, and has no required life limit assigned.  In response to this incident the airplane's manufacture sent a safety notice to all DC-8 operators.  In the notice, the manufacturer recommends that all operators review their maintenance procedures with respect to the scheduled inspection of all aircraft cables.  A special emphasis was placed on the proper cable condition and cable routing.",The asymmetrical activation of the left wing spoiler due to a broken retraction cable during takeoff.  A factor associated with the incident was the operator's inadequate inspection of the cable.

During a GPS approach, the pilot did not turn onto the prescribed course toward the final approach fix, and he allowed the airplane to prematurely descend below the specified altitude for the route segment until impacting a mountainside in controlled flight.  Actual instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, with a low ceiling over the mountains.  About 11 minutes before the accident, the radar controller cleared the pilot to perform the GPS approach.  The pilot indicated to the controller that he was aware of the initial approach fix's location and crossing altitude.  At no time during the approach did the pilot indicate he was experiencing difficulty navigating or request assistance.  The pilot initially navigated along the prescribed course.  Seconds after passing an intermediate fix where a critical 75-degree course change was required, the controller lost radar and radio contact with the pilot.  Rather than proceeding toward the final approach fix along the 153-degree prescribed course, the pilot's track averaged 107 degrees.  Also, instead of maintaining the 4,100-foot msl minimum altitude until passing the final approach fix, the pilot descended to 3,550 feet msl.  The airplane was equipped with a GPS receiver that had the capability of displaying a ""moving"" map.  The airplane crashed 5.9 nm east of the prescribed course and 550 feet below the authorized altitude.  The reason why the pilot lost situational awareness and his track became divergent is unknown.","The pilot's loss of situational awareness and his failure to adhere to the prescribed instrument approach procedures, including the track and altitudes flown.

The pilot was landing on runway 2, a 3,524-foot long, 70-foot wide, asphalt runway.  After touchdown, the airplane began to bounce and the pilot elected to perform a go-around.  During a second landing attempt, the airplane again began to bounce; however, the propeller struck the runway, before the airplane came to rest.  Subsequent inspection of the airplane revealed that both propeller tips had separated.  Additionally, the nose wheel strut assembly and lower firewall was bent aft.  The pilot said he did not experience any mechanical problems with the airplane.  Winds reported at an airport located about 14 miles east-northeast of the accident site, were from 020 degrees at 15 knots, with 20 knot gusts.",The pilot's improper recover from a bounced landing which resulted in a propeller strike and hard landing.

The airplane came to rest inverted after colliding with the airport perimeter fence.  While on approach to the airport, the airplane lost engine power and the pilot made a forced landing.  Initial inspection revealed that the P-Lead for the dual magneto was not connected to the system properly.  The inspection also revealed that the left side magneto timing was 10 degrees after top dead center.  The right side magneto timing was within manufacturer's specifications.  Further examination revealed that the points on the left side of the magneto were closed rendering the left side inoperative.  A functional check of the ignition harness capacitors was conducted.  When the ignition harness cover was secured to the magneto the left capacitor was intermittent.  With the cover loosened, the left magneto functioned properly.  It was noted that TCM SB 662A, replacement of date code affected capacitors, and TCM SB 651, capacitor grounding wire and attaching wire routing, had not been complied with.  The magneto was sent to the manufacturer for further examination.  The examination revealed that the primary ignition lead wire coil was misrouted from the terminal post to the distributor block.  This allowed the wire to become trapped between the case halves when the cover was secured.  When the wire was routed properly and bench tested it was found to operate within manufacturer's specifications.  Engine logbook entries indicated that 2 weeks prior to the accident the engine would not run on the right magneto.  The repair shop work order indicated that the left side points were grounded, rendering the left side of the magneto inoperative.  The points were readjusted and the magneto was retimed on both sides.  The magneto was returned as serviceable and reinstalled on the engine; however, the problem persisted.  The ignition switch and magneto capacitor were replaced, and the right magneto postion P-Lead was repaired.  The airplane was returned to service after a ground run revealed no mechancial anomalies.","Inadequate maintenance and inspection of the engine dual magneto that resulted in a loss of engine power during a critical phase of flight, and the subsequent undershoot forced landing in soft terrain."

The airplane sustained substantial damage during a forced landing to a field, 500 feet short of the runway.  While in cruise flight at 8,000 feet msl on an IFR flight plan, the airplane lost power on one engine.  An emergency was declared and the airplane was given radar vectors to an airport.  The pilot made a visual approach to the airport, but on final approach, the airplane lost power to the remaining engine and landed short of the runway.  The pilot reported that during preflight he did not visually verify the fuel load by removing the fuel caps and looking into the fuel tanks, since there was ""...standing water in the fuel caps and a moderate rainfall at near freezing [temperatures] and I did not want to contaminate my fuel.""  He reported that during taxi for takeoff the fuel gages read 1/2 full.  He reported he expected to be able to return ""...with just over an hour of fuel on board and leaving on a 45 minute flight.""

While in cruise flight, with the combustion heater turned on, the pilot heard an explosion. Smoke then entered the cabin, followed by a loss of electrical power. The pilot diverted and landed without incident.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the combustion heater exhibited heat and fire damage. The fuel pump supply line that ran between the fuel pump and the heater was found cracked at the fuel pump housing inlet, and was loose. The fractured surfaces appeared dull, and displayed carbon build-up.  Examination of the airplane's logbooks revealed that on December 1, 1993, the combustion heater had been removed, rebuilt, and then re-installed, at a total airplane time of 3,932.2 hours.  Additionally, there were no logged entries which indicated that the 20-year old Airworthiness Directive that was issued to ""prevent a hazardous condition caused by deterioration on the combustion heater"", for this particular model heater had been complied with. The airplane underwent an annual inspection in September 2001, at a total airplane time of 5,213.5 hours.

On the landing rollout the airplane departed the runway and came to rest inverted in an adjacent field.  The adjacent field had recently been plowed, and contained furrows.  The airplane traveled perpendicular to the furrows and nosed over.  The purpose of the flight was to practice maneuvers, and fulfill the experimental operating certificate limitations intial 40-hour requirement.  The pilot had accrued 5 hours of flight time on the airplane.  When he returned to land, he noted a crosswind, but did not believe that it would have an affect on the landing.  There were no mechanical anomalies noted with the airplane by the pilot.  Of note in the pilot's written statement was the directional instability that he encountered during takeoffs in the 7 hours that were placed on the airplane within the previous year.  He made several modifications, mostly rigging changes to the tailwheel, to improve the takeoff characteristics.  While in contact with the Sonerai technical representative, the owner stated that there were plans to convert the conventional landing gear airplane to a tricycle landing gear.  The proposed modification would solve the instability problem.",Failure of the pilot to maintain directional control on the landing rollout.  Factors  were the owner/pilot's inadequate remedial design changes and the freshly plowed field.

The airplane departed on a VFR flight.  The departure, en route, and descent portions of the flight were uneventful.  The airplane turned final ""high"" and approximately 1/2 mile from the displaced threshold.  On final, the pilot selected 40 degrees of flaps.  The airplane crossed the displaced threshold approximately 100 feet agl, and 15 to 20 knots fast.  The airplane touched down with approximately 1,750 feet of runway remaining.  When the nosewheel touched down, the pilot realized he would not be able to stop before reaching the end.  With approximately 500 feet of runway remaining, he decided to abort the landing.  The airplane lifted off at the end of the runway.  The right main landing gear struck a wooden fence at the end of the runway, and then an automobile traveling on a road.  The airplane spun approximately 180 degrees to the right, impacted the ground, came to a stop, and the pilot exited.  After the accident, the pilot did not report any preimpact failures or malfunctions with the airplane.",The pilot's delayed decision to abort the landing.

The pilot said he was flying home from Hastings, Michigan.  He said he checked the wind sock at his farm runway and found it indicated a direct crosswind.  The pilot said with a direct crosswind, he always lands on about a 350 degree heading.  The pilot said he touched down in the middle of the field.  The pilot said his field has a little rise at each end and that he had to add a little power to get on the far side of the rise.  The pilot said his power was back, he had full flaps extended, he flared and landed.  He said everything seemed normal.  The pilot said, ""But 100+ (plus) feet I feel I got a little tailwind and I locked my brakes, shut mags (magnetos) off and thought I would make it but didn't, plane landed nose down in bottom of 8' (feet) drainage ditch.""  An examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies.  Just before the accident, the winds reported at Battle Creek, Michigan, 19 miles south-southwest of the accident site were 260 degrees at 10 knots.",the pilot exceeding the proper touchdown point on the runway during the landing and his improper in-flight planning and decision.  Factors relating to the accident were the pilot misjudging his speed and distance during the landing and the ditch.

The pilot said the runway was covered by a thin layer of snow that had recently been plowed.  The airplane touched down, rolled about 10 feet, and began ""pulling"" to the left.  The pilot applied right rudder but to no avail.  He applied full right aileron and lifted the left wing to clear an 18-inch snow bank on the side of the runway.  The airplane traveled another 100 feet before the left wing lost lift and settled back down to the runway.  The airplane ""went through snow,"" spun around, and stopped 20 feet off the side of the runway.  The pilot found a skid mark on the runway made by the left wheel.  He suspected the wheel may have gotten wet when he had taxied for takeoff and the brake froze.  He said the temperature at 12,000 feet was -20 degrees F.",a wet brake that later froze resulting in a loss of directional control on landing. A contributing factor was the snow bank.

Prior to departing for the cross-country balloon flight, the pilot received a weather briefing from an Automated Flight Service Station.  The pilot was briefed that the wind speed was 28 mph on top of the mountains the flight was to cross.  The pilot reported that ""we decided that it was a little fast but doable.""  The pilot reported that he was unable to obtain weather information for his destination prior to the flight due to the lack of weather reporting facilities east of the mountains.  The balloon departed with a light and variable wind.  The balloon ascended to 11,250 feet msl and its ground speed increased to 52 mph as it crossed over the mountains.  After crossing the mountains, the balloon descended to 500 feet agl, where the wind speed was 32 mph.  As the flight continued, the pilot selected a field and attempted a high wind landing.  During the landing sequence the pilot and a passenger were ejected from the basket.  The balloon then took off and ascended to 1,000 feet with the remaining passenger, who was a balloon pilot.  The passenger took control of the balloon and landed safely 6 miles from where the pilot and passenger were ejected.","inadvertent flight into adverse (high wind) weather conditions, which resulted in a hard landing.

The left wing and horizontal stabilizer sustained substantial damage when they contacted the ground during the landing roll.  The landing was uneventful until the pilot lowered the tail to the ground, and the airplane suddenly veered to the right.  The pilot locked up the left wheel brake, but the airplane continued to the right.  Just before the airplane stopped, the left wing and horizontal stabilizer contacted the ground.  The pilot said that on several previous occasions the tail wheel seemed to stick initially and cause the airplane to deviate from the selected track, but would free up and track straight.  Post accident examination revealed that the tail wheel rotated freely until moved to its maximum left deflection limit, and the tail wheel locked in this position.  A mechanic detected wear on both sides of the thrust plate spacers (part number 3407-00).  He suspected that the tail wheel springs (part number 3233-00) were binding on the thrust plates.  He recommended replacement of the thrust plates whenever they showed wear on either side.","Wear on the tail wheel thrust plate spacers resulted in the compression springs binding on the thrust plates and the tail wheel sticking, so that the pilot could not maintain directional control."

Witnesses heard the airplane in the traffic pattern, and heard power being applied to the engine.  The witnesses reported hearing engine sounds until just prior to impact.   The airplane impacted nose first near a taxiway between runways.  The pilot, stated he thought he was around 150' to 200' above ground level, when the aircraft started to shake. He didn't think there was anything wrong with the aircraft prior to impact. The pilot did not recall hearing the stall warning horn.  The female passenger told rescue personnel they had just gotten off the ground when the plane started to shake.  Only slight ground scaring that was consistent with the wing tips, were found near the initial impact point.  In addition, the tail surfaces were not damaged, fuel was present in the left wing, the right wing fuel tank was ruptured, and the fuel selector was found in the ""BOTH"" position.  The engine was disassembly and revealed no discrepancies.  Control system continuity was established, and the flap motor indicated that the flaps were in the full up position.  The stall warning horn was found operable.

The airplane landed long and continued off the end of the runway into a chain link fence.  Nighttime darkness prevailed and the airport weather, observed 3 minutes after the accident, was visibility 1/4 statute mile, vertical visibility 100 feet, with temperature and dew point both 9 degrees Celsius.  A sheriff's deputy reported from the accident site that the visibility was 50 to 100 yards in fog.  The pilot reported that the accident occurred as he was returning to the departure airport following a 40-minute post maintenance checkflight.  He received the airport weather from the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) recording and was aware that ground fog had developed at the airport.  He received air traffic clearance and executed the instrument landing system (ILS) approach.  At decision height he was still in visual meteorological conditions and the runway and approach lighting were in sight.  The pilot continued his descent below decision height by visual reference and encountered dense fog and severe restriction to visibility at 50 to 75 feet above ground level.  The pilot did not feel a go-around was possible at that point and continued the landing approach, landing long on the runway and continuing off the end.","The pilot's failure to land on the runway with sufficient runway remaining as a result of his improper IFR procedure by his failure to maintain visual contact with the runway environment, and to execute a missed approach."

Snow fell as the pilot cleared the airplane using a ladder and broom.  A pre-takeoff contamination check was also conducted from the cockpit before the airplane taxied onto the snow-covered runway.  Once on the runway, the pilot back-taxied its full length and deployed a 10-degree flap setting for departure.  The pilot began the takeoff roll and rotated the airplane when it reached 90 knots.  The main wheels lifted off momentarily, then settled back on the runway.  The takeoff was aborted, but the airplane overran the runway departure end of the runway and collided with the localizer antenna.  A post-accident review of the company operations manual by the operator and the Federal Aviation Administration resulted in more stringent de-icing requirements for the flight crews and the addition of takeoff performance planning, as well as aborted takeoff criteria considerations for operations on contaminated runways.  Included in the new de-icing procedures was the mandatory use of de-icing fluid prior to taxi in freezing precipitation with outside air temperatures between plus 2 and minus 4 degrees Celsius.",The pilot's failure to adequately ensure the wings were free of contamination prior to departure.  Factors included the operator's inadequate de-icing procedures and the snowy weather conditions.

The airplane collided with power lines and landed in a vineyard about 1 mile south of Sonoma County Airport (STS), Santa Rosa, California, during a forced landing following a loss of engine power.  The pilot noted about 20 gallons of fuel in the left tank and 15 gallons in the right tank during preflight.  He flew from Petaluma, California, to Lakeport, California.  The pilot was cruising at 5,500 feet on the return to Petaluma and began a descent when he was abeam Santa Rosa.  He was well past Santa Rosa when the engine began to run rough; the right fuel gauge indicated 5 to 7 gallons.  He switched from the right tank to the left tank, which now indicated 10 to 15 gallons, and the engine ran smoother.  He continued toward Petaluma at an altitude of 3,000 feet, but could not visually acquire the airport's rotating beacon.  He tried to activate the pilot controlled runway lights, but still could not visually identify the airport.  He decided to fly back to Sonoma County Airport.  He lost and regained power five times as he headed to Sonoma County Airport.  The Air Traffic Control Tower advised him that a vineyard was south of the airport.  The pilot could not see the landing area because of the darkness, but headed toward the dark field.  He contacted power lines just prior to touchdown, but landed upright in the vineyard.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.  The recovery agent did not observe any fuel in either tank, and no fuel drained out of the fuel lines when they were disconnected during disassembly for transport.","The pilot's inadequate preflight and in-flight planning/decision resulting in miscalculation of fuel consumption, fuel exhaustion and loss of engine power.

The airplane was damaged when it went off of the left side of the runway, crossed a parallel taxiway and went down an embankment during landing.  The pilot stated that when he applied the brakes during the landing, ""...it felt like the left brake 'grabbed' and jerked me to the left.  While still on the runway I applied power and right rudder to try to straighten me out.  I immediately [went] left very quickly on to the grass."" Subsequent to the accident, the nose landing gear fork was found fractured in two places near the attachment to the strut portion of the landing gear.  No other anomalies were found with respect to the airplane, or its systems that were determined to have existed prior to impact.  The nose landing gear fork was examined by the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory.  The fork was found to have deformation consistent with excessive lateral loading.  The fracture surfaces were examined and both fractures exhibited signatures consistent with overstress.  No evidence of fatigue or preexisting damage was found.","The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing resulting in the overload of the nose gear fork. The overload failure of the nose landing gear fork, the embankment, and the remedial action not possible were contributing factors."

The airplane lost engine power and the pilot ditched it in the Pacific Ocean about 1/4-mile offshore.  He was on the return leg of a cross-country flight and had experienced no problems with the airplane or engine on the outbound leg.  The pilot did not note any anomalies during the engine run up prior to takeoff on the return leg, and thought that takeoff performance was similar to previous takeoffs with passengers on board.  The pilot established the airplane in cruise at 4,500 feet and an airspeed of 90 knots on an airway about 7 miles from the shoreline.  He established 2,200 revolutions per minute (rpm) and leaned for cruise.  Immediately thereafter, the engine speed dropped to 1,000 rpm.  He did not recall any loud noises; he just noted the loss of engine rpm.  He attempted to diagnose the problem, but his efforts had no results.  The engine stopped, and he made a turn towards the shore.  During the glide the pilot was able to affect a restart, but the engine lost power in less than 2 minutes and the rpm never rose above 1,000.  The pilot told air traffic control that he wasn't going to make it to shore, and ditched the airplane about 300 yards offshore.  The pilot and the passengers exited the airplane before it sank in 70 feet of water.  They were on the top of the airplane for about a minute before it sank.  Local authorities rescued the pilot and recovered one victim; one victim was not recovered and is presumed to be deceased.  Investigators were unable to establish magneto timing or obtain spark during the wreckage examination.  Disassembly of the magneto revealed that the impulse coupling spring was fractured and separated at two places.  Upon reassembly without the impulse coupling, one magneto fired on all four leads; the other magneto fired intermittently on three leads due to salt water corrosion on the contacts.  Metallurgical examination revealed that the surfaces of both coupling spring fractures exhibited micro features of corrosion on the surfaces.  These fractured areas appeared consistent with stress corrosion cracking.  Optical and scanning electron microscope examinations of the spring pieces uncovered many areas of corrosion and corrosion pitting on the spring surfaces.  The corrosion pitting was particularly evident on the edges of the springs, but other corrosion areas were visible on the flat faces of the spring.  A broken spring could retard the magneto timing to top dead center or after (the specified timing is 25 degrees before top dead center).  The engine logbooks showed that the magneto inspections required in Airworthiness Directive 96-12-07 had been complied with.

The pilot ""propped"" (hand started) the engine and the airplane subsequently took off with no one aboard and crashed in nearby mountains about 2 hours later.  The aircraft was not equipped with an electric starter motor and the pilot normally and routinely started it by hand-propping.  The pilot (who was alone) stood behind the propeller when pulling on it.  He reported that, after propping the engine about 4 times without achieving engine start, he perceived the engine was flooded and returned to the cockpit where he turned the magneto switch from ""both"" to ""off"" and advanced the throttle to the full throttle position.  He then turned the engine backwards 10 revolutions.  He next returned to the cockpit again and turned the magneto switch back to the ""both"" position; however, he forgot to retard the throttle back to the idle position.  When he next propped the engine it started at maximum power.  The pilot attempted to restrain the airplane but was unable to do so and the airplane moved forward and took off with no one aboard.  The airplane was located the following morning about 45 miles northeast of the departure point, having crashed in mountainous terrain.","The failure of the pilot to retard the engine throttle to idle while hand-propping the engine, which resulted in the engine starting at full (takeoff) power and the airplane taking off with no one aboard."

The pilot filed an IFR flight plan and received a standard weather briefing, which included a forecast for light snow along the entire route of flight.  The briefing also included an AIRMET for occasional moderate rime or mixed ice in clouds and precipitation from 6,000 to 12,000 feet msl, and a PIREP for light rime ice at 5,000 feet msl.  About 20 minutes after departure, and cruising in IMC conditions at 5,000 feet for approximately 10 minutes, the pilot observed snow.  Several minutes later, the engine lost all power, and the pilot then applied the carburetor heat as part of his restart checklist.  The engine did not restart, and the pilot performed a forced landing to trees.  FAA Advisory Circular AC 20-113 cautioned pilots of impact ice forming on intake screens and carburetors when flying in snow.  The circular advised pilots to use carburetor heat as a preventative measure, rather than as a deicer.  After the accident, an FAA inspector attended a test run of the accident engine.  The inspector stated that the engine started with no difficulty and ran continuously.",The pilot's continued flight into known adverse weather.  A factor was the snow.

While in cruise flight, the airplane's left engine lost total power.  The pilot elected to perform a single-engine landing at the nearest airport, on runway 02.  During the landing flare, a gust of wind forced the left wing down and it struck the runway.  The airplane continued off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass area.  The winds reported by an air traffic controller from an airport 30 miles to the southwest, were from 330 degrees at 6 knots, gusting to 22 knots.  The airport where the winds were reported from had six runways, one of which was oriented on a heading of 340 degrees.   Examination of the engine revealed that the alternate air valve had broken off and was observed embedded in the fuel injector servo.  According to the Cessna 310H Pilot Operating Handbook, the last item under the Engine Failure During Flight Checklist, was to land at the nearest suitable airport.  The pilot reported 5,117 hours of total flight experience, 10 of which were in make and model.

The airplane departed on an IFR flight in VFR conditions.  The takeoff, climbout, and initial cruise were normal.  Approximately 35 minutes into the flight, ATC advised the pilot he was off course.  The pilot responded he was trying to rejoin the airway.  The controller instructed him to fly a heading, and when able, to proceed direct to the next VOR on his route.  The controller also advised the pilot of a possible mode ""C"" problem.  Radio contact was then lost for about 20 minutes.  When contact was reestablished, the pilot reported having electrical problems, and that his radios were intermittent.  The pilot added that he was climbing to 8,500 feet, and continuing to his destination, which was approximately 180 miles away.  That was the last recorded transmission from the accident airplane.  About 30 minutes later and approximately 110 miles short of his planned destination, the pilot started maneuvering to land at a local airport.  The pilot of another airplane witnessed the airplane in a steep bank, just before the accident.  The airplane impacted in a parking lot, and was partially consumed in a post crash fire.  Examination of the wreckage revealed the airplane was configured for approach, and the landing gear was down.  No preimpact failures were identified with the wreckage.  Maintenance records showed that the airplane had failed an IFR certification inspection about 2 months before the accident, and that the wiring behind the instrument panel was ""extremely bad.""  Examination of the alternator revealed that the brushes were worn asymmetrically consistent with a partial short in the rotor, or a rough slip ring.

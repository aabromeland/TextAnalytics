1094,41,Soft and flattering,"Every year i'm excited when the weather gets cool enough for sweater dresses. i love this one, with the longer length, slimming fit and pattern placement, and cozy soft fabric. delightful, inspires reveries of castles and legends (yes i looked up what ""eira"" stands for and went with it). highly recommended. fit is generously tts.",5,Recommended,1,General,Dresses,Dresses
1094,52,Great dress but not in green,"Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however, the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.",3,Recommended,1,General,Dresses,Dresses
1094,56,Gorgeous turquoise color,"I really love this this dress, but i agree with the previous reviewer about the belt around the waist-it is a draped piece of fabric that is very figure flattering where it wraps, but one side of the dress has no belt and it shows muffin tops/bulges.i would have loved this if the belt went all the way around. one other point i would like to make is that bra straps are hard to conceal. i bought this dress because of the gorgeous color, but ended up returning it because of the belt and bra strap i",5,Recommended,19,General,Dresses,Dresses

1080,27,Pretty but not worth the price tag,"Overall, it's a beautiful dress, and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price), and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's just a tad too short. for reference, i'm 5'5, 125 lbs and the 2 fit well, but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.",3,Not Recommended,0,General,Dresses,Dresses
1095,27,"Runs small, stiff top","I ordered this in my usual size 0 and couldn't finish zipping up the top, but also couldn't fill in the boobs. i am 5'7, 116 lbs, 32a. it is very cute, but the top was pretty stiff and unless it draped on you correctly, could probably be bothersome. i was disappointed in the quality of the skirt- no lining, simple cotton/polyester. i will probably return, try the size up, but was disappointed compared to how excited i was for it. i did like that it had pockets, and would be a fun dress to wear f",4,Not Recommended,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
1077,30,Looks fine if you don't move your arms.,"Three strikes and retailer is out for me! i am so disappointed. i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun, distinctive new shift dress. got it, tried it on, took it off, went back to look at the listing online...nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders. i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image, but it's not mentioned in the text. who on god's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder?! it hits every woman under 5'10"" right in the middl",2,Not Recommended,0,General,Dresses,Dresses
1094,46,Picotage sheath,"On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick, stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also, the color is a dark, brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.",3,Not Recommended,2,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer. this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it. it does drape nicely",5,Recommended,117,General,Dresses,Dresses
1081,52,Great style,"I loved this dress and purchased it in my usual m. however, i agree with another reviewer that it is too long for me at least, so i returned this and will buy it in petite instead. if you are shorter (i'm 5'2), the regular length doesn't fall right, the shorter front section falling right at the knee and the longer section falling halfway on my calf . but great style! looking forward to seeing it on me in the petite.",4,Recommended,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
1094,49,,"Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldn't decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green, so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes, the cut runs small but i don't think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6, and this one the 8 fit perfectly, so maybe one size up.",5,Recommended,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

1081,40,Comfortable and chic,"This dress is so comfortable, and i love the unique faux leather skirt and lace design. it really adds a special touch to the dress. i only gave it four stars because the top half is pretty boring...i wish the neckline wasn't so matronly. i'll definitely need a bib necklace or scarf to dress it up. i'm 5'5"" and 115 and ordered the xs. i wish the dress cut in a little more at the sides to accentuate an hourglass figure, also. my husband loved it.",4,Recommended,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
1072,34,"Wonderfully made, poorly designed for busty gals","Like others reviewers mentioned on here, this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me, as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame, but for tall, busty, and curvier girls, it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Complaint Against : Wells Fargo Financial National BankI was charged a {$25.00} late fee on a {$500.00} remaining balance for paying {$120.00} well ahead of the due date but not covering the full "" minimum '' payment of approximately {$190.00}. When I explained the details of the situation, they did not acknowledge the best effort I made to be current and refused to waive the fees since in their determination it was not a Wells Fargo Error. The fee is unfair, and their choice to not waive the fee was a horrible busines practice and abusive in nature as it rested on "" There is no beneift to us having to waive the fee '' Bankground Details : In XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a hot tup and took advantage of a dealer finance option that used a Wells Fargo Outdoor Solution credit card to provide XXXX months interest free financing. The total amount financed was approximately {$5500.00}. On XXXX I paid XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$2500.00} and knew there was a {$500.00} remaining balance. Given I had XXXX months interest free financing, I just diveded by XXXX and set my bill pay to send {$120.00} each month. On XXXX my XXXX {$120.00} payment was made. When I got a collection notice it showed the payment received but a late charge of {$25.00}. I immediately paid all the remaining principle of {$370.00} on XXXX and currently have a {$25.00} balance made exclusively of the fee. When I contacted Wells Fargo at XXXX they transferred me. The rep I spoke to spoke to his supervisor XXXX times about my situation and XXXX times said he could not waive the fee even after I explained the situation. When I asked to file a complaint, the rep was n't aware of anyway to file a complaint. He offered for me to speak with his supervisor. I spoke with supervisor "" XXXX '' who said she would file a payment dispute. She continued to say they would not waive the fee as Wells Fargo did n't make an error. She kept saying they send out statements and that I just need to read them. My main point of frustation and complaint is that I was paying at an accelerated rate and made a best faith attempt to not only be current but pay more than required. What I failed to realize, is even though the account has credit card access they based the minumum payment on 3.5 % of the ORIGINAL balance. My accelerated payments did n't do anything to change the minimum on what I thought was a credit card account. Because I planned out my payment strategy up front, I did n't look at the billing as they came and did n't realize their unusual therefore to a small extent deceptive minimum payment process. When I asked how frequently they get these issues, they would not answer, which makes me think it is fairly common. I sincerely believe there is an ongoing business practice to extract fees from otherwise interest free accounts without regard to customer concern or reasonable waiver policies. They went as far to partially blame current regulatory environment for not allowing discretionary waivers. My hope with this complaint is to get the {$25.00} fee waived if possible, but more importantly to ensure Wells Fargo Financial National Bank is required to have a better complaint program than they seem to. They only took the billing dispute when I made them and did not know about any complaint program. Then to make matters worse the billing dispute can take XXXX days - my balance would have been paid off for over XXXX days by that point. They do n't need 60 days.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I wanted to know what interest rate might be to get a credit card for my mother to use for some upcoming dental work. I filled out an online application, just to see, got the interest rate information, and decided NOT to apply. I believe I did cancel the application, but the card came in the mail anyway. 
When I could n't get past all the barriers on their website, I phoned the company to CANCEL the card. The representative told me that my mother had to speak to him herself, or that I needed to send my POA documentation to them, in order to close/cancel the account. 
My mother, who has XXXX and lives in an XXXX, was NOT involved in any part of this process. 
Additionally concerning is the fact that she was turned down by another company because she has no credit history for the past 20 years or more. This company appears to have made no inquiries at all as to her creditworthiness.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Approximately two years ago I opened up a secure credit card with Wells Fargo Bank for {$1000.00}. Over the course of this last year in 2014 I have experienced some financial hardships. However, at this time I am trying to repair my credit ; the XXXX step was to deposit into the holders of my credit cards. I have XXXX with XXXX XXXX and a secured card with Wells Fargo. The account with Wells Fargo is a secured XXXX credit card ; I made a {$1000.00} deposit 2 years ago. I was over the credit limit allowed for several months. On XXXX XXXX I made a payment into the Wells Fargo secured card for {$1100.00} to date the money has not yet been available to me. I have made several phone calls over the last 7 days and I was informed that there was a hold placed on the deposit to ensure it was clear from my bank. I informed them the money had posted to my XXXX XXXX XXXX account and was no longer available to me and that it should have been credited to the Wells Fargo account. Finally after one week of a waiting for these funds to be available I have been informed today that the account was closed on XXXX XXXX. After the card underwriter in the credit services department at Wells Fargo reviewed my credit history she informed me that they would not be able to reopen my Wells Fargo secured card a nd then I was tranferred back to the customer services dept of the credit services department I was told I would not be receiving my refund of the {$1000.00} dollars collateral for at least 45 to 60 days. I expressed my profound disappointment and anger as I need these funds for my day to day living. I have bills that desperately need to be paid and my intent was to pay them from the funds deposited to that card. When I asked for a supervisor I was disconnected. When I called back to speak with a supervisor I was told that I did not meet the criteria for a rush of my {$1000.00} back to me. I am a relatively new XXXX and I an a single parent with children in XXXX. I can not afford to have {$1000.00} just sitting somewhere.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo informed me that they made a "" business decision '' to close several of my accounts. I have serious concerns related to the credit card account and associated cash back rewards account which were closed, with that said : I have concerns in that the {$1700.00} in earned cash back rewards ( see attached .xls ) which were part of the promotional offer extended to me in exchange for account opening will not be honored. The referenced {$1700.00} in pending cash back rewards were earned by me and due to vest on XXXX XXXX 2015 in conjunction with the advertised promotional offer. The subject 5 % cash back promotional offer extended to me had several conditions which were required for the account holder to qualify for the promotional payment. I fulfilled all of the required obligations to meet the requirements outlined by Wells Fargo under the terms and conditions to qualify for and earn under the 5 % promotional offer, curiously however Wells Fargo asserts in their response dated XXXX XXXX that '' as of the date of this letter, this account does not have any cash rewards that are eligible for redemption and we respectfully decline to fulfill your request to credit {$1700.00} to your account '' After carefully considering my objections below I respectfully request that Wells Fargo review their prior response dated XXXX XXXX 2015 for accuracy and legal standing to address the issue of my pending cash back rewards balance of {$1700.00} which was set to vest on XXXX XXXX 2015. These cash back rewards funds were earned and are rightfully owed to me. Account limitation and closure appears to be an action taken as direct retaliation for my insistence that Wells Fargo honor their promotional agreement. Denial of full payment on the cash back rewards balance related to the promotional offer is ill advised, unethical, fraudulent & entirely unacceptable behavior which will not be tolerated. 

Wells Fargo 's actions with respect to the aforementioned account closure & denial of payment on the cash back rewards balance constitute fraud in the inducement, bait and switch and failure of specific performance related to the terms and conditions of the promotional offer which all parties expressly agreed to be bound by and was the basis for the bargain at the time of account opening. 

Wells Fargo is within it 's rights to close my account, however to allow me to complete all of my responsibilities with respect to the promotional offer and then arbitrarily seek to avoid payment on a previously earned cash back rewards balance is a procedural and substantive unconscionability on Wells Fargo 's part. Unconscionability is a doctrine in contract law that describes terms that are so extremely unjust, or overwhelmingly one-sided in favor of the party who has the superior bargaining power, that they are contrary to good conscience. Furthermore, under common law an offer can not be revoked after it has been accepted. Moreover, in this instance performance remains and consideration is due so Wells Fargo has a duty and obligation to pay the full amount of my earned cash back rewards balance related to the promotional offer. Wells Fargo 's failure to pay the full amount of my cash back rewards balance related to the promotional offer for which I had fully qualified and Wells Fargo 's refusal to state a valid reason for account closure constitutes bad faith as it would appear that the account was closed solely with the intention of depriving the account holder of the promotional payment. 

It is undisputed that a valid contract with acceptance and performance exists which lacks consideration and justice so requires Wells Fargo honor it 's obligation under the contract to provide payment in full ( {$1700.00} ) on the disputed cash back rewards balance related to the promotional offer for all of the reasons outlined above.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo 's informed me that they made a "" business decision '' to close some of my accounts. I have numerous concerns related to the accounts which are slated for closure, with that said : Since Wells Fargo has determined to close my cash back visa signature card account through no fault of my own, I am left with serious concerns that my pending cash rewards will be forfeited & that my rights related to the Fair Credit Reporting Act have been violated.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have XXXX credit card accounts with Wells Fargo. I accidentally paid off the wrongcard and now they have charged me the accrued interest on the only remainingcard. I mixed them up and paid off the card that was n't due until XXXX and thecard due in XX/XX/XXXX has been charged over {$900.00} in interest. Both the other cards were paid off. I did not have any late payments, all monthly payments on all XXXXcards were paid on time previously and I have excellent credit. This was a terrible oversight as I have XXXX serious illnesses and I am on XXXX. I have sent them a letter by a fax XXXX times and they have not responded. I can pay off the entire balance due ( minus the deferred interest ). 
I have no money otherwise for this deferred interest as I am on a strict budgetfrom XXXX. This was a terrible mistake and I am begging someone to helpme with this.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I found that Wells Fargo reported to a credit reporting agency that I owed them a debt of {$420.00} on XXXX 2012 on a credit card account. I never opened a credit card account with Wells Fargo and have no knowledge of any credit card charges made on a Wells Fargo credit card in my name. I wrote to Wells Fargo and informed them of these facts. I also told Wells Fargo that I believed that these charges were fraudulent and suspected that I had been a victim of identity theft. I requested that Wells Fargo conduct an investigation into the matter and that Wells Fargo provide to me all account documents and billing statements related to this claimed debt so that I could determine whether I had been a victim of identity theft as I suspected. Wells Fargo responded but refused my request for documentation and its response does not indicate that it conducted any investigation into my claim that I had been the victim of credit card fraud and identity theft.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I received a letter from Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX OFFERING me an increase on my card and stating all I had to do was call the number ... XXXX ... to answer a few questions. Little did I realize what would result. The rep asked my income and I told her. It is higher by about {$5000.00} than when I got the card. The letter states : your account must be open, in good standing, and your credit limit must not have changed in the past three months. '' Great ... that 's me. A person named "" XXXX '' or "" XXXX '' said, sorry my income does n't meet the requirements. I disagreed and asked to speak to her supervisor. My income is more and my debt less, so I do n't understand. XXXX told me she would have the supervisor email me later and I said I 'd rather hold and speak to the supervisor ... .and after a hold of about XXXX minutes, someone who identified herself as "" XXXX XXXX '' spoke with me and reiterated what was said. The supervisor was fake understanding and conciliatory but would not understand my point. My main complaint is the letter and their tactics were deceptive. The letter never said I would have to requalify and prove my income. According to the letter, I fulfilled all the criteria, and they said they were raising the limit, I did n't ask. Adding insult to injury, I am a Wells Fargo customer with a checking account and a home mortgage with them.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a Dillards XXXX XXXX card. I used it on XXXX/XXXX/2015 to purchase a XXXX of items at Dillards in XXXX. I happened to sign on to the credit card website today ( XXXX/XXXX/2015 ) and it has the balance due listed as owed by XXXX/XXXX/2015. I received no statement in the mail or by email, no notice that the due date was here. Further, the secure email feature on the website was XXXX, so I was unable to contact Dillards. This is the XXXX time in a year that the card has listed a payment as due without sending me a statement or notification. I know they have my email and address because they are constantly sending me marketing advertisements. 

Is n't this illegal? Are n't they supposed to let you know when the due date is on a payment? Last time, the payment was listed as overdue and again, I only found out because I signed on to see if there was a statement available.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I submitted a payment on my credit card at Wells Fargo Financial National Bank. The bank applied the payment to a mortgage at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage that was paid off XXXX years ago. Wells Fargo sent the payment back to me, and Wells Fargo Finncal National Bank is now calling me constantly about the supposedly overdue payment. 
"
Wells Fargo & Company,"Last month on XXXX XXXX I made a payment to my Wells Fargo college credit card. I called them before I made the payment because I had a question and then the customer service rep offered to take off XXXX late fees If I set up a payment, he then asked if I would like them to take the money out automatically or if I would like to pay it myself at the time that I set it up for. I told him that I would pay it myself NOT to automatically take it off of my checking account, he said ok that was the end of the conversation. So after I got off the phone I went to the atm and deposited XXXX dollars into my account before I made the payment of XXXX dollars. I made the payment and everything went fine until the day after I made the payment and tried to use my debit card, I got declined. So I went online to check my account and it says that Wells Fargo college credit card took XXXX dollars off my checking account and over drafted me.. So they charged me XXXX even though I just told the customer service rep that I did NOT want them to automatically take it from my checking account. So in total I was charged XXXX. So I had to wait until the next day to call them because they were closed. I called the next day in the morning and told them that they charged me XXXX and overdraft my account to send XXXX of the XXXX back because they were not supposed charge me XXXX. So they sent back XXXX on XXXX XXXX which put whatever amount I had on my account back and took off the overdraft. My balance of my credit card then went down to XXXX something dollars and everything was fine. On XXXX XXXX I get a call from them and I missed it so I check my credit card account and it says that my balance is XXXX something and that I have a past due balance of XXXX dollars, it said that the took the XXXX that I wanted them to keep on there off. So since they took it off I 'm expecting that money ( XXXX ) to be in my checking account because that means that they took off my payment all together, remember that they charged me XXXX.. XXXX is XXXX and they returned XXXX XXXX on the XXXX. XXXX is XXXX and on XXXX XXXX they took off the other XXXX from my credit card account which means that it should have went back to my checking account which it did n't. So I went inside of the bank so I can talk to them in person because the over the phone was not helping, the bank teller has to call the Wells Fargo credit service as if there a regular customer, they have nobody that works with the credit card service in the bank that I can talk to in person ... So the banker calls and the credit cared rep is basically saying that I never made a payment for XXXX because it did n't got through.. So I left the bank. But my payment I made on he XXXX did go through and the one that they made on the XXXX where they charged me XXXX clearly went through to since it overdraft my account. So they are basically stealing my money and acting as if I did n't deposit XXXX dollars to my checking account to pay my credit card bill and they expect me to pay that same XXXX they stole from me again, I called them again and hey we 're saying the same thing. they would n't transfer me to a supervisor or a manager even though they said they would so I hung up and went to the bank again and went though the same thing, like wow how do n't you understand what I 'm trying to say. they were NOT helpful at all and there basically telling me that i did n't pay something I KNOW I PAID. This is not he XXXX time this happened to me either they always making some mistake when I try to pay off my credit card balance as if their trying to mess my credit up or something and I 'm just tired if it already. And why would they wait all the way to XXXX to mess with my account again, I never told them to take off both XXXX dollars in the for place just XXXX because they wrongfully charged me XXXX dollars instead of the XXXX that I was initially trying to pay..

Wells Fargo & Company,"Good Afternoon, My complaint is with Wells Fargo Bank and payment recording policies on XXXX. During the last ( XXXX ) years I have paid from the same Bank ( non Wells Fargo ) never late ; However, when I pay my balance in full they apply a hold on the account. Most recently, on XXXX XXXX I paid {$3300.00}, which posted from my XXXX financial account on XXXX XXXX 2015 ; consequently ; As of XXXX my founds are still on hold while Wells verifies my account. As mentioned this is the third time I have been declined at time of purchase to make aware of issue. I believe further investigation will show my average daily balance and interest may be affected and if this practice is policy for millions of customers, this is unfair. I have previously had XXXX XXXX XXXX information verifying this is my account. I have asked Wells to state what amount triggers the Hold and I was informed they can not disclose. So basically, they pick and choose which payments go on Hold and post in XXXX hours. I made other payments from the same account in XXXX that have posted. My funds were deducted on XXXX days ago and unavailable. Please assist.

Wells Fargo & Company,"In XXXX of 2014, I applied for a secured credit card with Wells Fargo ; I was required to deposit {$5000.00} with Wells Fargo in order to obtain the card ; the bank employee told me that they would hold my {$5000.00} for 1 year after which they would return it to me. Wells Fargo still has my {$5000.00} after I recently decided to cancel their credit card and they now state that they will not return my money for at least 2 months! 
I received a letter from them regarding "" closure of your credit card '' with absolutely no mention of my {$5000.00} security fund. It no longer appears on my online summary either.

Wells Fargo & Company,"XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXXI am filing a complaint against Wells Fargo bank regarding inaccurate reporting of my Wells Fargo Credit Card account to the Credit Bureaus. 
I have never used my Wells Fargo Credit card - ever. Wells Fargo has reported activity on my Wells Fargo Credit Card account. 
Wells Fargo reports on my XXXX XXXX credit report a payment of {$9.00}, but reports no balance, date of last payment. Wells Fargo reports on my XXXX XXXX credit report a {$0.00} payment, and last payment made in XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, but does not give a balance. Wells Fargo reports to XXXX XXXX Credit report date of last payment as XXXX, but does not report payment amount or balance. Since I have never used my Wells Fargo credit card this is inaccurate and false information. 
I called Wells Fargo regarding this and they told me it was my overdraft protection activity. I have never over drafted on my checking account/debit card. My debit card and my credit card are XXXX completely different accounts. And I have never used my Wells Fargo credit card. I said I would go to Wells Fargo bank and sit with a banker to address this. 
I went to my local Wells Fargo Bank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I was told by the teller it was going to be a very long wait, if I would like to come back later. I said no, that I would wait. I saw a banker within a few minutes. 
The Wells Fargo banker had trouble answering my questions. I asked him to call the necessary department or banker on the phone. While he asked some of these questions, the phone banker hung up, is what he told me. Since I was n't getting my questions answered, I asked Wells Fargo banker, to please note that down for me and I would leave in order to contact CFPB. He declined to give me anything that would state what his answers were or that he was declining to write anything down to state his not wanting to. Eventually, he did. I showed him the Wells Fargo reported activity on my XXXX XXXX credit reports reflecting a lot of activity with balances and scheduled payments and the High Balance of {$1100.00} on the XXXX and the credit report from XXXX. He implied he did not know where I got those from. He also told me to get my statements. 
I have never used my Wells Fargo Credit Card so why was there a high balance of specifically {$1100.00}? My credit limit was {$8200.00} in XXXX through XXXX. The banker could not answer most of my questions. So again I asked him to call the online banker. So he called again. He did say that I was given an increase of {$13000.00} XXXX in XXXX and in XXXX of XXXX the credit limit was decreased to {$2000.00}. He was unable to tell me why. There was a {$76.00} balance with a {$15.00} scheduled payment due, the XXXX XXXX was {$1100.00} on my XXXX credit report. Why does my credit card account have any activity on it at all? 
Wells Fargo reports inconsistent, inaccurate information on the reports. Wells Fargo reports a scheduled payment of {$9.00} due on the XXXX of XXXX over and over again. I have never used my credit card so this is false information. 
Please help me get this cleared up with Wells Fargo bank.

Wells Fargo & Company,"To Whom it may Concern, I 've been dealing with a fraud issue. I had fraudulent transactions on my card and it was taken care of promptly.

I was told it was because my card and the fraud had not been dealt with the correct way the XXXX time and instead of closing my card I was just issued another. 

The XXXX time there were XXXX fraudulent charges totally about XXXX dollars. On my statements I can see provisional credit for only XXXX charges. The merchant that billed the fraudulent transactions reimbursed all XXXX of them and Wells Fargo promptly debited my account for all XXXX charges, stating I had already received credit for them. However, I had only received credit for XXXX transactions, leaving me approximately {$250.00} short. 

I was told that I had received the missing credits on the old card before the balance transfer and I would see it on my statement. It did not appear on my statement so I called again and was told I would get another statement in the mail that reflected that I had received credit for all XXXX transactions. I have received nothing, there is no proof I ever received credit for those transactions ( Aside from credits that were later taken away as debits ). I just want tangible proof that I was reimbursed or credited for those charges. Today on the phone I was told I had received credit ( even though it was debited shortly after ) so my request for written statements has been denied and I need to accept verbal confirmation from them that I had been credited. All I am asking for is a document showing XXXX provisional credits, XXXX merchant credits, and XXXX bank debits. All they can produce are statements for XXXX provisional credits, XXXX merchant credits, and XXXX bank debits. There are XXXX missing credits. By law I am entitled to these records.

Upon, the scammist arrival, he had paperwork to file out and had the company information readily available. He was however, casually dressed, but I said alright perhaps a low grade business casual attire is permittable. However, in the midst of my vulerability, he took the credit cards and the rest was history. All accounts at Wells Fargo of 20 plus years were comprised and closed, but I stated to the bank, that I was the victim of fraud and I was immediately interrogated.

Wells Fargo & Company,"A complaint was filed with Wells Fargo regarding my daughter being associated with a credit card. Wells Fargo sent a letter to my daughter informing her of the deletion of the account and it being removed from her Credit File. I just recently discovered that during this process Wells Fargo changed the account number and then associated my name with my daughter 's Social Security Number. Also the letter referenced above and attached states remove the account ending in XXXX but my daughter and the credit bureau did not receive a letter to remove the newly created account number. The account that belongs to me was removed from my credit file and remained on my daughter 's credit file. This is causing a major problem because she was in the process of applying for a mortgage. So I am dealing with Wells Fargo associating my name with my daughter 's Social Security Number and I am getting pushed around from department to department, customer service reps in call centers that just read notes. Switching Social Security numbers is a serious issue that is now affecting us both. I am asking for Wells Fargo to first correct the social security number problem that was created by them ; get the account back in my social security number and have the credit bureau remove my daughter 's name from everything associated with this account which is what Wells Fargo said they would do.

There was no notice of this 18 month requirement in either the consumer credit agreement I signed, nor their current agreement. 
This has had an impact on my credit as it has reduced my available credit.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have had a Dillard 's credit card since XXXX of XXXX without XXXX missed payment or late payment. I pay my bill online every month. Dillard 's card services were taken over from XXXX Bank around XXXX XXXX by Wells Fargo. XXXX XXXX XXXX Online Bill Pay did not recognize the new Wells Fargo/ Dillard 's account. In XXXX I started making payments directly through the Dillard 's website to ensure that the payments would get to Wells Fargo correctly because of this transition so I began to pay my bill directly through the Dillard 's website. The afternoon of Friday XXXX XXXX I received a call stating that they could tell I was trying to make a payment but could see it was n't going through. I immediately paid over the phone as to not cause a problem and keep my account in good standing. The very next morning at XXXX I receive a call that my only brother at the age of XXXX died unexpectedly in his sleep.This was a very difficult time for me. Mid XXXX I returned to the Dillard 's website to make my payment, checking the only visible numbers of my bank account number were accurate, which they were, I posted my payment and received a confirmation number. The same thing happened mid XXXX, and I received a confirmation number, again in XXXX, and again in XXXX. It shows a monthly history of payments and confirmations for each month with my last correct XXXX digits of my bank account. I never received notification or a message stating there was any problem with my account and payments. I will attach payment confirmations from XXXX XXXX and can go back further if need be and the confirmations from Dillard 's website from XXXX to XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX when I went to pay my bill, as I did every single month, my balance was about {$150.00} over my credit limit. This immediately alarmed me because I always pay my bill, I received confirmation numbers so I called to see what was going on. A not so polite woman informed me they have not been getting my payments and the confirmation numbers were worthless. Now Wells Fargo, a banking and credit card giant has closed the account I have had with no problem ever and has not notified me once to inform me the confirmation numbers I was receiving did not matter. This has made a detrimental hit to my credit unfairly because Dillard 's, the company that I loved to shop with, worked through college with, had every intention of paying my debts to, received confirmation that I was paying, switched their credit card company and had a problem with their transition to Wells Fargo.I have never had a problem until now. I also hold another account with Wells Fargo for the last XXXX years that never has had any problemwith payments. In fact, for the last XXXX years I have not had a single late payment to any of my debtors. I want to pay my bills. I hope you can help me remove this terrible stain from my credit report.

They confirmed it would not so I explained that I would not want the balance transfer to be processed. The representative assured me there was no balance transfer processed on my account, however days later I learned from my limited available credit they had processed a balance transfer to my other credit card. I called and advised I would need it reversed as I had not authorized it, or if so had expressed that I did not want it as they did not advertise that balance transfers were not included in the offer. They also had charged me a fee that I was requesting to be credited. Wells Fargo representatives informed me I would need to proceed with a fraud claim and be issued a new card and that would cancel the balance transfer made on the old card. I did that waited XXXX days to get my new card and the balance transfer amount of XXXX had been credited back on my card, but not the fee.

After numerous attempts to contact Wells Fargo with no success I had no choice but remit total payment of {$1300.00} ( cc remaining balance - {$630.00} + interest- {$720.00} ). I still can not believe a credit card company could charge more in interest than your balance and not notify you that you are going to be charged. If I had known I would have paid the remaining balance off immediately. It was very frustrating that I could not contact anyone at Wells Fargo to dispute these charges.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I received a 15 month, 0 % promotional rate "" Supercheck '' for my credit card from Wells Fargo in the mail. I placed a balance on the card for a large purchase around $ XXXX. A few months later I used the card to make several purchases and was informed ( on the phone by a Wells Fargo representative ) that I only needed to pay the minimum balance and the total amount for my purchases ( not including the XXXX percent portion ) in order to avoid any interest charges. I did this for a few months until I realized I had been receiving interest charges upwards of {$40.00} each. So I called up Wells Fargo again ( XXXX ) and spoke with a representative that also gave me incorrect information. In addition, I learned that my payments were being split up between the XXXX different balances in an unpredictable allocation percentage. One month could be XXXX, the next could be XXXX ( which was roughly the case ). In the meantime my purchases on the higher interest were growing exponentially ( and so was the interest ) because the allocation of my payments were going largely towards the 0 % interest loan. I was directed to speak with a supervisor ( XXXX ) whom informed me of this. After XXXX practically did nothing for me except drop the interest for 2 of the several months I was charged, he informed me that the only way I could avoid more interest would be to pay off the entire balance ( 0 % interest portion and the purchases ). The reason was because there was no way to tell how my next payment would be allocated. I was directed to speak with another supervisor, XXXX, who told me the same things and kept saying things that were completely irrelevant. After a while it seemed like she got the point that Wells Fargo was screwing me over. She promised to have her supervisor, Georgia, call me on Wednesday ( XXXX ) but I received no call. 

My major complaint here is about the Credit Card Act of 2009 that states in section 164 : '' ( b ) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. -- ( 1 ) IN GENERAL. -- Upon receipt of a payment from a cardholder, the card issuer shall apply amounts in excess of theminimum payment amount first to the card balance bearingthe highest rate of interest, and then to each successive balancebearing the next highest rate of interest, until the paymentis exhausted. "" In addition, the terms listed on the Superchecks state : "" Your minimum payments will be applied first to lower APR balances before higher ones. Payments in excess of the minimum payment will generally be applied to balances with higher APRs first ''. Now the "" generally '' I assume applies to the general statement in the Credit Card Act because there is the exception in part ( 2 ) that refers to deferred interest balances in ending within two months. 

This is unacceptable customer service, deceiving, stealing, appears to be illegal, and mal-business practice. In addition to being held accountable for such, Wells Fargo should also be held accountable for the information representative give. 

Note : all my payments are on time and in excess of the minimum payment plus the purchases of that month.

However, it claims that because this merchant ran a {$290.00} charge FIVE MONTHS EARLIER ), then this charge must be valid. 
So, does not matter if I dispute a charge or not, nor that it matters if I truly purchase something, just because WFC does not want to process a dispute, then the consumer/card holder must suffer its representatives laziness or ignorance. Moreover, if a merchant made a charge and the card holder did not questions the first charge, then if the merchant makes additioanl charges sometimes in the very far future ( not even on a specific pattern ), then the charges must be valid ( even of WFC or the Merchant can not produce any evidence ).

I had no prior contact from them via email, phone call, or text. ( see attached Statements JPEG of account messages ) I had no idea the autopay did not work until it was too late. I caught the account up after I was notified, via letter, and called Wells Fargo myself. I thought all was well until I had applied for a car loan and noticed my credit score dropped XXXX points!!! Wells Fargo made no effort to alert me that my account was delinquent ( see Statement JPEG and if they had looked at my payment history they would have seen that I made my payments on time and should have made a better effort to alert me. I would have taken care of it then, instead of ruining my credit score for a simple misunderstanding. I am an honest customer who made his payments and I do n't feel like my credit should be ruined because of this mistake. I can understand a late fee and having to report that, but an account closure is absurd! 
I contacted Wells Fargo and attempted to get them to rectify the situation but they did not even take a statement from me or ask about my side of what happened and then I get a letter in the mail about the situation and she did n't even try to rectify the correct issue. I just want this account closure stricken from my credit record and my credit score to reflect that. This was just a misunderstanding and they made no effort to help whatsoever!

Wells Fargo & Company,"Hello, I am writing to submit a complaint against Wells Fargo, a company that provided me with a credit card and has charged me with XXXX time interest despite the fact I contacted this company in trying to avoid this charge. 

In XXXX of XXXX I acquired a credit card at the store, XXXX and XXXX. The card was provided by Wells Fargo, and according to the terms of the credit card, no interest would be charged for my purchases for up to a year. Since XXXX of XXXX, I made monthly payments to the credit card. 

In XXXX of XXXX I was notified that the card was no longer valid, since XXXX and XXXX cancelled their agreement with Wells Fargo. This meant that I could no longer use the card, which was contrary to the contract signed by me. I did not care about this ; and I continued to pay my debt. The last payment was due on XXXX XXXX XXXX. I made my payment a couple of days later, unaware of the fact that I had been penalized with additional interest. At the beginning of XXXX, my balance was {$390.00}. Since my payment had been late I was charged {$240.00} in interest. This increased my debt from {$390.00} to {$680.00}. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I called Wells Fargo trying to explain that missing my payment had been an honest mistake, and that I had totally forgot the deadline. During this phone call I expressed my willingness to pay my remaining balance ( which was close to {$400.00} ) in trying to avoid the interest payment. I also reminded the people of Wells Fargo that this account was not of any service to me going beyond XXXX, since the card had been cancelled in XXXX. I naively thought that since we were still within the month of XXXX, the people of Wells Fargo could at least show some understanding and offer a reasonable solution. Yet, after half an hour on the phone and having spoken with XXXX different representatives from Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was only offered a reduction of XXXX dollars. According to Wells Fargo Representatives this was the only help they could offer. 

I am writing this complaint hoping you could stop this company from applying such unfair interest to customers such as me, who despite being late by a couple of days, made monthly payments throughout a year. I am appalled by the lack of understanding of companies like Wells Fargo, who can change the terms of a credit card when they want, but would not extend the same understanding or courtesy to their customers. I believe this practice to be unfair, arbitrary, and capricious. As a result of simple, brief mistake my balance -- on the eve of being paid off -- almost doubled. I understand if nothing can be done to help me, but I honestly hope you can look into this so that other less fortunate individuals avoid getting trap by Wells Fargo 's arbitrary practices. 
Thank you XXXX XXXX

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a credit card with Wells Fargo Bank. Payments are due on th XXXX of each month. I have an automatic bill payment set up with XXXX to occur on the XXXX and arrive by the XXXX. For XXXX months in a row, Wells Fargo has not received/posted my payment until after the due date. Two weeks after the payment generated to them. I beleive Wells Fargo is delaying posting. There is no reason why a bill pay check between XXXX of the biggest banks in the world takes two weeks for delivery. Wells has reversed the XXXX fee when I called them. Im not sure if they will handle the XXXX fee since they told me it was a one time "" courtesy ''. They could not explain why the delay, saying only that the posting date was the date of receipt. They encouraged me to have WFB draft the payment against my XXXX account. However, I want the process to work as it has for several years of having this account.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I reported my credit card as stolen as soon as I was certain I did n't have it anywhere. When I called the credit card company we discovered there had been fraudulent charges. The representative informed me that they put a hold on my card due to suspicious activity. I was told I would be credited for the charges and an investigation would take place. A week later I received a letter explaining my claim was denied as they believe the card was in my possession. This is not true. These are fraudulent charges. I did not sign or put in my pin number for these purchases which I believe should act as evidence. If my credit card company investigated my usual activity it should be clear these purchases are not typical in my credit card usage.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have XXXX accounts with Wells Fargo. The accounts became difficult to manage with a loss of income. The first account is XXXX XXXX visa XXXX. The second account is XXXX today XXXX. I placed both accounts into consolidated credit to bring them current. The accounts were with consolidated credit counseling for 3 years. In the last year, I became XXXX. I removed the accounts from credit counseling because I could no longer afford to pay the higher amounts. The higher amount were established when the principal balances were higher. Wells Fargo refused to lower the payments to the current balance minimal payment. I had to report the company to consumer federal protection bureau. At this point Wells Fargo decided to correct the minimal payment. They never updated two months of the old minimal payments causing my monthly payments to be higher. I was making payments under the new agreed upon amount but the old {$90.00} payment was showing past due by two months. Wells Fargo never attempted to correct the problem. I called but I paid the new minimal payment amounts. The next notice, I received was a charge off notice. I tried to explain that it was mistake that was never corrected from past representatives but to no avail or correction. I was told the chargeoff would stand and to make arrangements.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo Home Projects Visa has repeatedly assessed late fees when payments were made before the due date. Customer service was helpful in resolving this issue in the past and provided direction for how I could avoid the problem in the future ( details below ), but has not agreed to reverse any more late fees despite following their direction. 

The details of the matter regard a period between the due date and the statement closing date. Wells Fargo sets the due date on the XXXX of every month and does not allow any grace period. I have always paid prior to the due date. The statement closing date is on the XXXX though and the problem occurs when a payment is made towards the next statement prior to the closing date of the previous one ( e.g. when payment is made on XXXX XXXX for the statement due XXXX XXXX ). Even though the payment is made in advance of the due date, a late fee is still assessed. This is contradictory especially since there is no grace period i.e. any payment made after a due date should indicate a payment made towards the next statement. 

I have made every effort available to me to accommodate Wells Fargo Home Project Visa 's business practices. A customer service representative directed me not to make payments until the XXXX. Recent events would indicate that this was not correct and another representative informed me that this date can vary. I have also been told from other representatives that many people encounter this problem. Questions about the effect of this problem on my Credit History and Report were also answered unsatisfactorily. The representative stated that the Credit History would not be effected until the account was more than 30 days past due. Unfortunately, after making payments on time since opening the account, Wells Fargo still believes the account to be delinquent.

The balance on the account consists of only fees. I feel this is a compliance violation as I should be responsible for the balance if its just fees.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I applied online at wellsfargo.com for a secured credit card with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX2016. After the application was complete, I received a screen that said my application was pending because Wells Fargo needed more time to gather more information. I did not receive any further correspondence from Wells Fargo about the application nor did I receive a phone call or any message from my Wells Fargo account about the application. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I checked my account in the morning and found that {$300.00} was taken out of my bank account for the secured credit card that was approved with Wells Fargo. At this time I still had not received any information that I was approved for the application or that money would be taken from my bank account to start the secured credit card. As soon as I saw the money had been removed I called Wells Fargo to find out why. I spoke with a representative in the credit card department who advised me that I was approved for the application and that I would receive a card in the mail within 7-10 business days. I advised that I was upset about the steps that had been taken with no communication on Wells Fargo 's part to advise of the approval and that I wanted to know if I could decline to receive that account. The rep advised me that I had 10 days to call back to get my money back immediately but if I did not then it would take 45-60 days to have funds put back into my bank account. I waited 2 days to see if I would receive anything from Wells Fargo stating the account was approved and I did not. I proceeded to call Wells Fargo and close the account. I was advised that it would take 45-60 days to have the funds refunded to my account. I proceeded to advised the representative the issue and what had happened and she advised me that it may be sooner since the account was not fully funded and still in processing. As of XXXX XXXX, 2016 my funds have still not been refunded to my bank account and I still have not received any communication that I was approved for a secure credit card and what the terms and conditions of the card/application are. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX2016 and spoke with XXXX representatives and nothing was attempted to get my funds refunded sooner than XXXX business and I was advised that Wells Fargo 's policy was that they only refund the collateral hold within 45-60 days. Because I did not receive a email/letter/call about the approval for the application I was not made, aware before the funds were taken out of my account, that this was a policy of Wells Fargo and that it would apply to me once the funds were removed.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I opened a Secured Credit Card with Wells Fargo in XXXX 2014 with an initial collateral deposit of {$300.00}. I was told, upon review of my positive account history, my account was eligible for graduation to an unsecured card. I used the card for a year, made my payments on time, if not paying in full, never went over my limit, and kept careful watch over the card. I called Wells Fargo and requested a {$100.00} increase to my credit limit, which required another {$100.00} collateral deposit. I used this limit for a while. 
Last year, I called and asked a banker what was keeping my account from graduating into unsecured, and if it is not eligible for graduation I would like to cancel my card. She informed me to "" hang tight '' and do not close it yet as I was "" very close '' to graduation. She specifically told me that I should be graduated within the "" next two months. '' Here I am a year later, still on the secured card from Wells Fargo. They now tell me that there is no way that they can tell when the accounts will graduate, and that I was severely misinformed by the banker who said I would graduate. 
When I first got the card, my credit score had a few blips on it, all of which were taken care of in the first year of having my card. Since then, I have been able to increase my credit score to XXXX with no collections or late payments on my account. They are now telling me that my credit score is something they take into account, and that may be a reason why they are not graduating me. 
I feel that it is unethical, and possibly illegal, to promise me a credit card will be unsecured "" in two months, '' if that is not the case. Now, the phone bankers are eager to try to pull a credit report and get themselves a "" referral credit '' in trying to open me up a brand new account. I keep refusing this, as I am not wishing to have a hit on my credit report for their referral credit.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Approximately 12 years ago I opened a credit card with Wells Fargo ( WF ). At the time, and until I became aware of this situation, the card did not have a charge. Approximately 7 years ago I attempted, and believed I had successfully, closed ALL accounts/cards/services with WF. Two years ago ( 10 years after opening the card ), I applied for a loan and found out I had a {$20.00} payment overdue on the WF card. At the time, I had {$90.00} of rewards on the card. I spoke with the credit reporting agency that notifies customers of their late payments who stated that, for accounts under a {$25.00} late fee, they make no attempts at contacting the customer. My fee was approximately {$21.00}. WF later stated they could not apply my {$90.00} in rewards to the {$20.00} fee without my approval. Instead, WF reported me to a credit bureau. The address on file was my old address which was never updated because I had been told my card was closed. My email remained the same. WF continued to send me statements, even after my card was closed, and still have even to this day after MANY requests to have them stop. Non of these emails contained the late payment because it was not money I actually spent on the card, just a fee. Thus, I never became aware of the fee via email. Of note, the emails require a 'customer ' to sign into an account to view the activity. However, if you have closed your account, the 'customer ' in unable to do so, thus, eliminating the possibility for the 'customer ' to gather a full understanding of the email contents. 

Two years ago, I spoke with WF and the managing supervisor assured me they would reverse the report. WF has yet to do. WF will not release my {$90.00} in rewards because they say the account is closed. This {$21.00} payment 90 days past due is the only defect in my credit record. WF deceived me into believing : ( 1 ) ALL accounts were closed when I initially tried to close everything ; ( 2 ) the card was free without notifying me of the new card cost, approximately 6 years after I had last used the card ; ( 3 ) the emails being sent were not a result of an open account, rather an electronic bank glitch that continued to send emails. WF stated I could not change this setting because it was an automatic setting that could n't be changed unless I reopened the account. 

The struggle with WF has been going on for approximately 7 years regarding closing all of my accounts. I am still unsure as to whether my account is actually closed as I still receive emails to this day. I have no way of checking on the card because my account is closed. WF states they will not correct the problem because there was not a bank error. WF has made many errors including not actually closing my accounts when requested, not allowing non-active customers access to credit card information, coordinating collections efforts that do not call or email customers with a balance of under {$25.00} in the event their physical address is outdated, not correcting the issue when promised, not halting statement emails, not providing a customer their reward points, and by not notifying a customer of the increased fee. 

Essentially, WF has created a system in which an inactive customer has no way to follow-up on a 'closed ' card and make any necessary changes to receive the necessary information regarding any mistakes or misunderstandings. 

The actions WF has taken in remedying this situation have been extremely negligent and have not been fixed. I had previously closed my complaint with the BCFP because WF had assured me the problem would be corrected. I am reopening the issue because WF has failed to do so and have email correspondence supporting my assertions.

Wells Fargo & Company,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I disputed a charge on a Wells Fargo ( WF ) issued credit card for XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). The purchase was made at a XXXX affiliated store, XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Hawaii. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I called WF Disputes Department agent XXXX who wrote advising me WF ruled the transaction valid. In the WF letter, I discovered a XXXX return policy agreement with my signature forged. The agent indicated on the phone he was on his third day of training so I requested a new dispute based on his lack of experience but primarily because of the alleged forgery.On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a letter from WF agent XXXX indicating the charge was valid because there was no return credit given by merchant, despite the fact the merchandise was returned on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. In his letter, the agent indicated I could contact him with questions, however, I never received a return call from left messages. Therefore, I sent a certified letter to WF requesting all documents provided by XXXX to support its claim the charge was valid. WF Executive Office contacted me and indicated remediation analyst XXXX would review my case and be in touch by letter. Once I received that letter, I realized the agent took only one day from the date I was contacted by phone to review 5 months of correspondence to decide the charge was valid. The decision was once again based on XXXX return policy and no issuance of a credit refund. Doubtful there had been a review, I contacted the Executive Office and complained about the apparent lack of consideration of the facts in the case.My complaint against Wells Fargo Financial Retail Services stems from : 1 ) apparent lack of experience of WF dispute agents and no return calls from agents, despite indication to call with questions 2 ) no consideration by WF of misrepresentation of product facts by XXXX sales person or mention of Federal Trade Commission complaint ( FTC reference number XXXX ) filed against XXXX for breach of implied warranty of fitness. Wells Fargo only offered an apology if I experienced any dissatisfaction with XXXX 3 ) no consideration by WF of Office of Consumer Protection of Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs complaint ( case # : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) 4 ) no consideration by WF of alleged forgery or police report ( Report # : XXXX ) for forgery filed against XXXX salesperson 5 ) no consideration for my XXXX acceptance of XXXX XXXX return policy ( had I been informed of or read XXXX restrictive return policy, I would have walked out of store without purchasing ) 6 ) concerned all letters and emails have n't been reviewed by WF, perhaps because not all documents were received ( this concern is based on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX emails sent to email address provided by XXXX in Executive Office but not received 7 ) concerned WF declaration the charge is valid is based on XXXX XXXX return policy agreement ( which bears my alleged forged signature ). WF apparently ignored XXXX refund offer, in a XXXX XXXX, XXXX email to me, for any price difference on an exchange item. XXXX XXXX return policy is apparently flexible and not set in stone as the company seems to indicate in communications with WF ( a refund is no longer acceptable as I have already purchased a bed from a different retailer ) 8 ) another concern is the connection between XXXX XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo. XXXX is XXXX largest buying and marketing organization and Wells Fargo Financial Retail Services is a preferred provider of consumer financing with XXXX ( from XXXX website ). XXXX is associated with XXXX and the WF credit card on which I purchased merchandise bears the XXXX label. Wells Fargo may be acting and deciding on behalf of XXXX and its affiliated store, XXXX.

That is n't mentioned in the agreement I signed. According to my records I did not sign any such thing. Unless they can furnish the document, then it did n't happen.

Also why would it start to happen 14 months later instead of 12? I have n't used the credit to buy anything besides my bed and pillows. Somewhere a mistake has been made.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo has refused to comply with the terms of a letter that they sent to me regarding convenience checks for a credit card account. Specifically, Wells Fargo has effectively charged me a 2 % check transaction fee rather than the "" 0 % introductory rate '' "" for check transactions '' described in their letter. This is an unethical "" bait and switch '' swindle which can not be justified based on the terms of their letter. 

In early XXXX of 2015 I received some convenience checks from Wells Fargo along with the attached cover letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2015. Please note that this letter contains XXXX and only XXXX sentence regarding check transaction fees. This sentence states : '' The rate for check transactions during the promotional period is 0 % introductory rate for 12 months from account open date, subject to a 4 % convenience check fee.... "" Now everyone knows that a convenience check fee is a transaction fee. Therefore, the phrases "" rate for check transactions '' and "" convenience check fee '' are merely different ways of stating the same thing because these phrases mean the same thing. Therefore, I assert that the only reasonable way to interpret the above quoted sentence from the XXXX XXXX, 2015 Wells Fargo cover letter is that the check transaction fee rate is supposed to be 0 % for the first 12 months and 4 % thereafter. 

I used one of these convenience checks, in the amount of the credit limit of {$20000.00}. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo placed a {$800.00} "" transaction charge '' on my account as well as a {$39.00} "" overlimit fee ''. Please note that the fact that Wells Fargo calls this a "" transaction charge '' is further proof that a convenience check fee is a type of transaction fee. 

I attempted to resolve this problem with Wells Fargo by making numerous telephone calls to various Wells Fargo personnel. They were willing to cut the fee from {$800.00} ( 4 % ) to {$400.00} ( 2 % ) and to waive the {$39.00} overlimit fee. However, they were unwilling to waive the remaining {$400.00} ( 2 % ) fee unless I repaid the balance. 

I sent Wells Fargo the attached letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, in which I thoroughly debunked all of the lame excuses that were given to me for charging me this transaction fee. 

I received the attached letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargo dated XXXX XXXX, 2015. I am not sure if this letter is a misdated response to my XXXX XXXX, 2015 letter or if it is merely an attempt to document Wells Fargo 's positions as a result of the telephone discussions between myself and XXXX XXXX and other Wells Fargo personnel. Regardless, XXXX XXXX makes no effort to reply to the specific arguments that I made to them both verbally and in writing regarding the only reasonable way to interpret the one and only sentence in their letter regarding check transaction fees. Instead, XXXX XXXX merely quotes this one and only relevant sentence from XXXX XXXX 's XXXX XXXX, 2015 letter and claims that it means something that it obviously does not mean while more or less ignoring the "" 0 % introductory rate '' "" for check transactions '' stated in XXXX XXXX 's cover letter. 

Please note that if Wells Fargo can somehow interpret their sentence to mean that they can disregard the first XXXX words in favor of the last XXXX words then this entire situation is nothing short of a bait and switch swindle because if the "" 0 % introductory rate '' "" for check transactions '' does n't really apply "" during the promotional period '' as they state in their letter, then it never ever would apply, which in turn means that such language should never have been included in their letter because it is unethical to offer any term or condition that would never apply under any circumstances. 

Considering the explicit language in Wells Fargo 's cover letter for these checks, any check transaction fees are unjustified and unethical.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Hello, During XXXX of 2015, I received a low interest rate offer from my credit card company, Wells Fargo, in my monthly bill statement promoting "" Superchecks '' that were linked to my credit card account. The offer is for 2.9 % APR for 12 months. The offer states that the superchecks may be used for "" balance transfers '' or as you would use a personal check for "" purchases. '' The offer clearly distinguishes balance transfers from purchases, and only states that there will be a balance transfer fee. 
After using XXXX of the superchecks for a purchase, Wells Fargo charged me a "" balance transfer fee '' of {$110.00}. I called Wells Fargo credit card center and the representative recommended I go to my local Wells Fargo branch to get the issue resolved, which I did on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX explained that since it was a credit card issue there was nothing she could do.

Wells Fargo & Company,"In 2008, I was offered a credit card from Wells Fargo Bank. I excepted the credit card incase of emergencies and went over the particulars with a personal banker. One of the topics was rather I wanted to have it linked to overdraft perfection ; I declined to have it linked to overdraft protection as I used a saving account for this. I also knew that if attached to my credit card that interest would build on overdrafts and any fees. 
I attempted to use the card during an emergency sometime in 2008 after never using it and found out that the credit card was full in the amount of {$800.00}. I contacted the bank and they told me it was link to my overdraft and that is why it has the amount of {$800.00}. I took responsibility as my car insurance came out and I used my debit card for about 2 days not knowing it was over drawn. Wells Fargo charged me fees on top of using my credit card which I never allowed them to use for overdrafts. If It was set up to my savings account like I had requested, the money would have been taken out of there and I would have only been charged XXXX small fee. The banker had signed me up for this to gain more of his/her incentive and I went to the branch to dispute this but they continently told me there was nothing they could do. I paid on this bill as I continued to try and dispute it but they would not help in any way. 
I have been paying on this credit card and have it almost paid off. During this time I was still disputing these charges and about a year ago I did not want to pay anymore until they worked with me as this was unlawfully and unknowingly attached to me account and the card has a really high interest rate. During this time they sent it to collections and I am now having issues with my credit and obtaining any financing. 
I am and have been willing to pay my over drafts and even the fee that would have been placed to my savings account. I have now paid XXXX 's of dollars in overdraft fees and high interest due to this banks negligence to monitor what their personal bankers do to receive there quotas. 
I have no problem paying the card off at this point but I do n't deserve to have this negatively affecting my credit as I have paid them over a XXXX 's in interest and fess that I should have never even had to begin with. ( fraud )

When I noted in XXXX that we were charged extensive finance charges on part of purchase, I was told by both the merchant and Wells Fargo Bank that there was nothing that could be done unless I could prove the terms of financing. At that time, I could not find my paperwork. This hurt our credit score and due to the finance charges also made it difficult to make such a high payment.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I lost my job back on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and then on XXXX XXXX my wife and I had a baby. Knowing that we are in serious financial trouble I called one of my credit card holders, Wells Fargo, who holds my XXXX XXXX Credit Card ( Account : XXXX ) and tried to set up some type of plan to continue paying on my account, but with a lesser payment amount. I spoke to the CSR who was willing to try to help me, she kept going back and forth between her supervisor and I and eventually came back and said there is nothing she could do. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she transferred me. I then spoke with XXXX of collections and explained my financial hardship to him and he said there was nothing he could do. I just find it very upsetting that we are trying to do the right thing and make payment arrangements and they are unwilling to accept anything from us.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Hello. 

I have a Wells Fargo credit card and my friend, XXXX XXXX, walked into a Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX, 2015, to pay {$5800.00} towards my credit card so that I would owe him and not Wells Fargo since my a.p.r will soon shoot up to 29 %. Whence XXXX XXXX went into the bank, he could have paid this amount a number of ways but the woman behind the counter recommended he write a check, which he did from his account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX he also has an account with Wells Fargo, which will become relevant later ). 

This past weekend, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I attempted to use the credit card only to have it decline ; I planned to use the card for late in XXXX to XXXX because I am a teacher and do not receive a paycheck -- anyhow, here we go : I call Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX, 2015 only to hear XXXX people in, finally speaking to a supervisor who said that the funds were not applied to my account and would not be until the bank "" felt comfortable '' doing so (?! ). I called back later and spoke to another XXXX people until I reached a supervisor. The second supervisor I spoke with said that the bank had a "" right until they felt comfortable -- '' it became laughable ; what policy, ever, has sounded like this? I then said that I would contact the Attorney General 's office, that I needed the funds to apply to payments, such as my car that is in the shop. She then told me XXXX XXXX could fax proof of his check clearing from his account, which happened on XXXX XXXX, 2015. He faxed both his bank statement and copies of his cleared check the next day. I was told that if this did not happen, I would have to wait until XXXX XXXX if he did not fax this information (?! ). 

I was ready to pick up my car today and called Wells Fargo. XXXX XXXX and I are still on the phone, as we have been for hours today. They keep saying that they need authorization from his bank and from all parties involved before they post his money to the account. The woman we are now speaking to is saying that we need something on letterhead from his bank that states his name on his account and his balance before and after he applied his funds to my Wells Fargo credit card ; he will need to go to his bank, they say, to do all of this ; apparently, his generous help must be followed by a generous portion of his time to say that he is him ... self ... They need this because he is not "" authorized '' to pay for my account. Wells Fargo has his money which has cleared from his account but are not applying said funds to my account and are now telling me that this will not happen for ten more days. Somewhere, in between all of this, we spoke with XXXX ( with an "" A '' ) said that there were insufficient funds, which has been refuted by the woman we speaking with now. 

Today I received a letter in the mail in which Wells Fargo informs me that funds will not be applied to my account until XXXX XXXX, 2015. It also said that a check showing clearance from my friend would clear up the matter, which, as mentioned, he already faxed a week ago. 

This is unscrupulous and absurd. 

I hope to hear from you soon about to resolve this.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I purchased a refrigerator and a cooking range from XXXX in XXXX, AZ around XX/XX/XXXX which was charged on a Wells Fargo credit card issued through the retailer. The terms of the finance was Zero interest if full purchase amount was paid within 12 months of purchase which was XX/XX/XXXX ( "" Expiration Date '' ). The total purchase price for both appliances was {$2700.00}. 
These appliances were purchased for my new house where I did n't move until XX/XX/XXXX. Due to the various activities involving the move and due to the issues with mail forwarding, I was behind in attending to my mail. As a result I did n't make the payment for the first two cycles on time but did pay them a few days later by phone along with late fees of about {$25.00} each time. I was told that my account is now current and as long as I made the full remaining balance on my account by the Expiration Date, I would no longer pay any interest. In order to ensure no more delays, I scheduled regular payments on my bank 's bill pay system so that payment gets sent each month on time and the full remaining balance is paid before the Expiration Date. Below is the schedule of all payments made : Date AmountXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXXX/XX/XXXX $ XXXXTotal Paid $ XXXXPurchase Amt. $ XXXXFees Paid $ ( XXXX ) Wells Fargo however kept carrying a balance of {$10.00} on my account and then charged me interest on it even after the last payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called them, they corrected the mistake but also closed my account and reported it to the Credit Bureaus as late payment for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. While I made the full payment of {$2700.00} before expiration date and paid them late fees for the first couple missed payments, they have taken the wrongful action of closing my account and making derogatory submission to the credit bureaus, when the underlying cause of this was **their mistake** of having left over fees on my account.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I applied for credit card in Wells Fargo recently and they approved my credit card and then closed all my accounts due to fictitious claims and fraud they filed against me without any due process. When i found out that i can used the card i then applied for balance transfer for the amount of XXXX dollars under XXXX card. It 's almost been 2 weeks since i did it and no response was made so i applied for a new card to take advantage of the offer of zero APR for 15 mos. I called Wells Fargo to follow up so that i can just consolidate my debt in one and they did approved the balance transfer after the conversation on the phone and then after that i was issued a letter informing me about the closure. They are very tricky since i had a feeling that my balance transfer will either be denied if i did n't have any card at all and so even if i still have doubts i continued the process. And what a co-incidence when my accounts was closed on XXXX XXXX, 2015 then the letter came in dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 closing the credit card while when i called earlier for follow up i was n't informed about the closure. So to make it short i applied for balance transfer again to another account to avoid any inconvenience and surprises under the company and i am waiving the balance transfer fee since i was charged XXXX dollars for savings account without issuing any checks at all and if somebody issued me a check or remittance they are the XXXX liable for any draft fee. I feel humiliated for their harsh treatment and being ignored in spite of my plea to prevent my account from closing too.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I purchased furniture from XXXX XXXX and I received about {$3500.00} in defective items. I made numerous phone calls and sent numerous e-mails to the merchant, but I received no response from XXXX XXXX. I purchased the goods with my Wells Fargo Financial National Bank XXXX XXXX credit card # : XXXX. I am dissatisfied with the goods I received from XXXX XXXX and I have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant. I may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. I am disputing the following charges : {$2800.00} and {$760.00} on my credit card account.

Wells Fargo & Company,"On a recent visit to my local Wells Fargo branch -- where I only wished to have my PIN updated on my debit card -- I was "" offered '' the opportunity to apply for their Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card. Though I was n't particularly interested, the branch agent stressed how the XXXX card would offer a great chance for a "" lot lower interest rate than your other cards '' which I had said averaged 13.6 %. Fine, I thought, and applied right there through the agent who was entering my application on his system. 

A few days after the application was made ( with a credit score of XXXX and a verifiable income of {$80000.00} ) my online banking Wells Fargo account added the following card to my account list:1. Wells Fargo Platinum ( not the XXXX card the agent said I was applying for ) 2. A credit limit of {$50000.00}. An interest rate of 22.5 %, following the 0 % interest 15-month grace period. 

In short, I was bait-and-switched by the branch agent on the product I was applying for ( no mention was EVER made that I was applying for or might be downgraded to a different product ) ; the likely amount on the credit limit ; and the interest rate ( that is nearly double any of my other cards ). 

After first contacting the agent ( a XXXX XXXX XXXX to voice my complaints, I was pushed up the ladder to an XXXX XXXX, the "" Regional Banking District Manager, Vice PresidentXXXX Colorado - XXXX ''. XXXX assured me that he would look into the matter, and that he would be pushing the case further up the line. A few days later, I noticed that the account 's credit limit had been increased to {$14000.00}, but the account remained a Platinum card account with the 22 % + interest rate. Once again, this was offered to a long time Wells customer ( 20+ years ) with a XXXX credit score and verifiable income. 

I next received a call from Wells "" Premium Card Services '' and was abruptly told by an agent named XXXX, "" your card will remain a Platinum with 22 % interest rate, and no, there is no one else to discuss this with because how we have arrived at that decision is confidential ''. 

So that was it : bait-and-switched by Wells Fargo with no further explanation, and taking the hit on my credit report for making the application in the first place.

Wells Fargo & Company,"We have a Wells Fargo Signature Visa card. We see an interest charge on this month 's statement. On Wells Fargo online we can not find any information about the interest rate charged or the method of calculating the monthly interest charge on the WellsFargo.com Website, which we use for all our banking. I called Well Fargo Customer Care on the Visa statement and asked to find out where this info is available on the Website. The first person said he was not familiar with the online and transferred me. The second person said he was the Web site person and after XXXX minutes of trying, established that this information was not available on Wells Fargo.com and was also not available on the VISA monthly statement! He gave up trying to find out where on the site to go. I said I wanted to register a complaint and was transferred to another Customer Care person who gave me a case # of # XXXX and a phone number of XXXX XXXX ( Executive Offices ). I am writing now because in my experience when the answer is negative, that rather than say that ( on a recorded line! ), that you are referred to someone who will call within 24 hours. 
Okay, so my complaint is that neither the Wells Fargo online nor the statement show this significant consumer information easily available to the consumer where they themselves advocate the customer should do their banking when possible. That missing consumer information is twofold : 1 ) the interest rate including the APR charged on their Wells Fargo Signature VISA card, and 2 ) the method Wells Fargo uses to determine the monthly interest charge posted to the account. 
I know there was a booklet we got maybe even annually where that info may reside. That should not be the only vehicle for transmitting such significant information that the consumer should have readily available as they look at their statement and make their economic decisions.

Wells Fargo & Company,"XX/XX/XXXX I signed up for a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card to take advantage of a XXXX, no interest financing for an engagement ring purchase. I began to make payments to the outstanding balance appropriately so that the balance would be paid in full in exactly 12 months. XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to add additional wedding jewelry purchases to the card and assume a new 12-month no interest financing offer. I continued to make payments on the card to pay off the first balance by the XX/XX/XXXX deadline. I later discover that the payments were being applied to both financing offers through an inexplicable system algorithm, and that while I thought I was paid in full by XXXX, their system showed an outstanding balance on the first offer. They then proceed to exercise their clause to charge 27.99 % APR on the remaining balance. 
When I called to ask for remedy through changing how the payments were applied to each offer, they alleged that they had no ability to control how the payments were applied and could not give me "" credit '' for having paid the first full balance by the 12 month deadline. They then offered to reduce the total interest charge by 25 %, and were unwilling to accept a counter-offer of something which I thought was more reasonable, which still accepting fault for something I ( and they ) could not control. I called to request audience with a level of management above the Supervisor level but was denied. I am disappointed with Wells Fargo Financial National Bank and their inability to accept responsibility for maintaining a system which has full control over people 's financial matters with no ability for human override.

Even though I had not even applied for it to begin with. that would require running my credit again. She promised to give me 15 months 0 interest she even put notes on her computer stating that she had called credit services and they would honor my request. 
well that was not true, when I activated my new card I called to verify the interest. They ran my credit for nothing, it was just a waste of my time, I went in to the bank a few times to solve that. A banker told me I would get a response within 10 days its been about 20 days I 've never received a call regarding that incident. I want my credit restored and the can keep their credit card.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Originally I filed a complaint under case number XXXX concerning the sale of a credit card debt from Wells Fargo Bank to XXXX XXXX XXXX. There were XXXX basic issues in that complaint. 1 ) I had never received an accounting of how the balance was determined ; and 2 ) the fact that Wells Fargo had issued me a check in the amount of {$300.00} dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for an administrative error which was questioned. 
After the complaint was filed, Wells Fargo did provide documentation of the balance which I am satisfied with. However, they have never explained where the administrative error check came from or how the amount was determined. Since then I contacted XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargo who had sent the balance information. He called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX but could not explain the administrative error check and provided the name XXXX XXXX who would call me back. XXXX XXXX called later that day. She stated it was not an administrative error but an inconvenience payment. After several questions she could not answer why the payment was made or how the amount was determined. She said she would call back after she spoke with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have attached a letter from myself and documents from Wells Fargo.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I paid a company called XXXX XXXX a total of XXXX between my Wells Fargo Visa and XXXX XXXX for services that were never provided. They were to teach us how to effectively sell on XXXX, set us up with drop shippers and create a website. All of this was with the promise that I would get my money back within one year. They never provided the website or any of the drop shippers. They did nothing to justify the money we paid. We had to pay another company for a website and do all of the stuff they promised through other companies. I was informed that I am unable to dispute these charges because of the time that has passed but I find that this is not an acceptable answer. This company has been paid a lot of money for nothing.

Wells Fargo & Company,"On my Wells Fargo credit card I made a balance transfer of {$900.00} which carries no interest for 18 months. After that I made about another {$1000.00} of purchases, which are subjust to a regular purchase APR. I made some payments and got paid from a larger contract, so when I applied my payment in XXXX 2016 my balances were as follows : {$930.00} in purchases. {$780.00} in 0 interest promotional balance. 
I made 2 payments during my statement period, {$100.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16 and {$1200.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16. The last purchase I had in the period was on XX/XX/XXXX, so the purchase balance was established with no pending transactions. 
When I called Wells Fargo Customer Service to inquire about how my payment was applied I was informed directly that the computer "" splits up the payments as it sees fit '' so that any money applied after the minimum payment due gets inexplicably divided between my balance subject to interest rates regardless of the CARD act. I contacted Wells Fargo 's customer service and was told nothing could be done, I was stuck with this incorrectly applied payment. Afterwards I contacted Wells Fargo 's customer care center and conveyed my concern that my payment was applied outside of compliance with the CARD Act, and was told that I was, in fact, correct and that they had made a mistake in how the payment was applied. My case has been escalated to be reviewed and to have my payment applied correctly. 
This is highly concerning to me, as Wells Fargo is probably making millions off of unsuspecting customers or those who do n't know any better. In reviewing my account further I found that every month Wells has applied my payments in this split manner, thus preserving an interest-bearing balance on my card despite receiving amounts that should have satisfied it -- therefore still charging me interest.

Wells Fargo & Company,"XX/XX/2014, I purchased Jewelry on the a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX. This was a 12 months same as cash arrangement. When I received the bill, I set it up for 12 months with 2 weeks before the final due date. My account was on auto payment and was in good standing. 

Wells Fargo did not apply my last payment until after the "" deadline '' date of the contract ( let me reiterate, this was on autopayment and completely in good standing. The amount sent he period was greater than what was required to payoff in advanced of the arrangement ). Believing my payment was paid in full, I did not check back until a credit alert occurred on my credit score. 

I called Wells Fargo immediately and was told the only way for me to dispute the charges was to fax or mail a letter. The letter below was sent on XXXX XXXX. I have since called twice ( with their collection agencies calling my phone multiple times a week ) and the letter is never received. Forcing me to either pay {$540.00} ( which is about XXXX % of the amount I put on this card to start with ) or get a 60 day delinquent mark on my credit. 

( The fact that my last payment was not applied for several weeks was CONFIRMED by a Wells Fargo Rep when I called ; however, he could not do anything about it. He could only ask me to send a letter. That letter was never received. ) This is a predatory practice. The fact there is no way to dispute and get a resolution of these charges short of a fax or a letter that will never be received is prove of this.

I received a letter from Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX, 2016 noting that there had been some suspicious charges on my account and that if this particular account activity continued after receiving this letter, Wells Fargo noted they would close my account. 
The charges were valid charges, however, I followed the direction and did not make any additional charges whatsoever after receiving the letter on XXXX XXXX, 2016. 
Logging into my online account yesterday, I noted that my credit card has now been closed without warning or letter from Wells Fargo. More importantly, the {$1500.00} in Wells Fargo Go Far Rewards have not posted and have been XXXX out. 

This is wrong. I received a letter from the credit card company/bank and I followed the letter 's directions and did n't make any additional charges. Additionally, for them to close my credit card account outright without notifying me first is also wrong I believe. All charges were valid. Lastly, if they so choose to close my account for whatever reason, I should be entitled to the {$1500.00} in rewards points I rightfully earned. 

Wells Fargo runs a promotion and refuses to pay out to their customers? I believe this is wrong and I am expecting to get paid out my {$1500.00} in rewards. I am hoping you can step in on my behalf.

On XX/XX/2016 my mother made a {$43.00} deposit into my checking account through the ATM, which was posted to my account on XXXX. That means the bank was working with my money for 4 days before they transfered it into my checking account, which resulted for me to have a negative amount of {$0.00} cents on my secured credit card, since I was unable to make a transfer deposit. 

On XX/XX/2016 I was finally able to transfer {$0.00} cents into my securedt credit card after the bank deposited the {$43.00} my mother deposited into the ATM on XX/XX/2016. For the transfer of the XXXX cents I received another {$35.00} fee. 

My account is now overdrawn by {$71.00}. On top of that the bank charged me another {$10.00} annual fee on my secured credit card, that means my card is now overdrawn by {$11.00} which probably result in another {$35.00} fee on the next day. I was not aware of an annual fee and the bank never informed me before debiting my secured credit card. 

Since I am on XXXX my Social Security payment comes into my account always on the XXXX of each month. With now {$82.00} in minus on both accounts together I am not able to pay my utility bills.

I discussed above details and send me the account opening documents and was never provided with those till date. On multiple calls afterwards I was told they do n't have any such opening document and the XXXX billing insert has the 0 % APR info.

Wells Fargo & Company,"In XXXX my monthly payment increased to {$1.00}. The billing department could not explain why. Since they did not receive the addtional {$1.00}, my payment was processed late and late fees plus interest charges were applied to the following month 's payment. This continued on for 4 month 's with compounding interest and late fees mounting. I have this account set up to pay the same amount every month through my banks bill payer. I should not have to review the paper statements every month to know what my payment is going to be although the gentleman I spoke to said it could fluctuate? I do n't use this card for anything, have made no other purchases on it. Why should my monthly payment fluctuate? This does not occur on my other credit cards. Now my charges have come to almost {$300.00} in late fees and compounded interest over the past 4 month 's. This does not include the regular monthly payment. So in summary, they are now trying to collect almost {$300.00} for a {$1.00} short payment.

In short, there is no possible way that I have missed or have been late with a payment. When I got my last statement, Wells Fargo has charged me a {$25.00} late fee.

The agent said, "" As a XXXX time courtesy, I can reverse the charge but you will be responsible for future late fees.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a credit card from Wells Fargo- {$800.00} limit.

I called the bank XX/XX/2015 to transfer the {$1200.00} back to my checking, I was told that the money will show in my checking account the next day ; I waited till the next day as was told but the money was n't in my checking account so I called again that day-XX/XX/2015, I was told that they will take care of it. On Monday the following week-XX/XX/2015, I went to a shop and my credit card was denied so I came back home and checked my accounts, I did not see the {$1200.00} that was supposed to be transferred back to my checking account and my credit card had been closed. I called them and they said they transferred the money back to my checking account XXXX mistakenly and this threw the credit card account over the limit and my credit card account was closed, the reason being that I went over the limit because the bank made a mistake and transferred {$1200.00} XXXX times back to my checking account instead of XXXX. I called the bank, they told me that they will reopen the credit card account and also request from the credit rating companies to nil of this incident from my credit history. To my surprise, I called this morning, I was told that it was my fault that they transferred {$1200.00} back XXXX into my checking account ; they said because I called XXXX and requested for the transferred back to my checking account and that they did that. 
I am feeling this complaint because I feel cheated out, embarrassed at the shop and felt like this is discriminatory. 
It was not my fault that a bank will make a double transfer when I was told that I was supposed to see the money in my account the next day and when I did not see it, I called back. The transfers did not show on my checking account until the next day-XX/XX/2015, so as at XX/XX/2015, I had no knowledge that such transfers were made.

I called immediately to have them remove the XXXX payment, and they claimed they could n't. Well, they claimed they could, if only they could see the XXXX payment ( which I could see! ), and the other half their staff could see the XXXX-payment but did n't have the authority to remove it. They told me to call back in an hour ( at midnight ) and maybe things would be different. I called back the next day, and they said I had to wait until the charges posted in XXXX days before they could reverse them, and even then they suggested I do it through my bank instead of them reversing the charge that THEY made in error. I knew there was no hope in the event that I overdrafted, but fortunately I did not. 

TWO months later, in XXXX, they XXXXcharge me again, this time for {$120.00}. I call immediately, and again deal with XXXX customer service reps in a near repeat of the last incident. I tell them I am cancelling my card, and they cancel it. The extra money they took from me, I asked if it could be moved to my Wells Fargo mortgage rather than getting a paper check. They said no, but tried pushing me to open a checking account with them so I could move the funds into there. I said no to that idea, and they were going to mail the check. I wait weeks and weeks and never receive the check. I call them up and they say the check was cashed. They tell me they 're going to send a stop payment affidavit out ( mailed only, they ca n't fax or scan or email it to me. ) That was XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX I call and follow up, and they tell me that they never ordered the Stop Payment, but will send XXXX out right away. XXXX XXXX they still do n't know why the Stop Payment never came to me. During that XXXX XXXX call, they told me that the check had been cashed, they did n't know where it had been cashed at, and they had in their possession a copy of the signature of the back of the check. I asked to see the endorsed check, and they refused during this XXXX XXXX call, saying they 'd mail it to me after the affidavit was sent back in ( the affidavit I still have n't received as of XXXX XXXX ). Now they say that is n't true, they do n't have a copy of the signature of the check. 

This process has gone on way too long. In my eyes, I cancelled my card on XXXX XXXX after they took unauthorized money from my account, and it is now XXXX XXXX and I am still waiting for my unauthorized funds to be returned to me, after speaking to XXXX representatives the day of the incident, and spending four more days of phone calls since then in the last 3.5 months.

Wells Fargo Credit Card Customer Service has been a horrible business to deal with.

XXXX XXXX is a Monday, which is not a day that I go to the bank, due to my work hours. I also habitually deposit my checks, and do not cash them, since I pay by credit/debit card and keep a ledger of all transactions down to the penny. The cashed check is therefore very unlikely to be mine. Wells Fargo has claimed they have a copy of the endorsed check, and said they would send it to me after receiving back the XXXX Payment affidavit. I would like to see a copy of the endorsement, for my personal records.

I have not used this card in over a year and have not received a bill in that time. This is the first that I heard of a balance or that a payment was past due. 

They certainly have my contact and mailing information, since I receive advertising and other offers from Wells Fargo frequently to entice me to use the card again. At any time they could have sent me a bill, but instead have only contacted me when this balance I was not even aware of is past due. 

Earlier that week I contacted Wells Fargo about a fraud alert email because of an address change I did not make. It was a false alarm ( simply an update from the post office ) but no mention was made of this overdue bill at that time.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I am submitted this claim to bring to your attention the deceptive practices of Wellsfargo Credit Card promotional rate offers. Nowhere on the promotional rate credit card balance transfer offer does it state how the minimum payment would be calculated or how the balance transfer fee would be required to be paid in the XXXX month 's payment plus the minimum payment. 
XX/XX/2015I received a Wellsfargo Credit Card Low Promotional Rate for my Wellsfargo Platinum Visa, acceptance offer XXXX. The superchecks promotion came with a 2.9 % APR for XXXX months after that the standard APR for purchases currently 11.35 %. My current credit limit for this card is {$15000.00}, it currently had a {$0.00} balance. 
I read the entire offer and the small print. A 3 % Balance transfer fee would apply. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, I called Wellsfargo CSR regarding this offer to see if it would be better to have them process the balance transfer and if it would process any faster. The Customer Service Rep stated there would be no difference. That it would still take 5 to 10 business days to process. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, I wrote out the supercheck # XXXX for {$14000.00} knowing that the 3 % or {$430.00} balance transfer fee would be added to my credit balance and I would not go over my credit limit. I deposited the check in my XXXX XXXX Checking account. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, the money was cleared in my checking account. I paid off one of my other credit cards to take advantage of the lower APR credit rate. When that transaction posted to both my Wellsfargo Credit card and my credit card I paid off, I began to check my Wellsfargo Credit Card for the minimum payment due. I like to plan a month or so in advance what my financial obligations would be. I checked my Wellsfargo check card for several weeks each time it said no payment due. I received no email referencing my account or any mail regarding my new transaction to that credit card account. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, I received an email that my Wellsfargo statement was available online. That my balance was currently {$14000.00}, and a minimum payment of {$610.00} was due on XXXX/XXXX/2015. 
I called Wellsfargo CSR ( XXXX ) on XXXX/XXXX/15 to question why my minimum payment was so high. Initially I was worried I missed a payment. However, XXXX stated that the first payment after a balance transfer includes the balance transfer fee plus the minimum payment. I told him that nothing is stated in the promotional offer to that affect. He said it has been Wellsfargo 's practice and terms despite not disclosing it in the promotional documentation. I told him this violates Truth & Lending law and is a deceptive practice. I asked to speak to the Supervisor. XXXX, Supervisor stated the same and as long as he has worked at Wellsfargo it has been their practice and calculation in first payment. I told him I have had the card for a long time and had done balance transfers and never had that experience. He filled out a form for Wellsfargo Executive Office to contact me tomorrow. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, XXXX from Wellsfargo 's Executive Office in AZ called me. I explained my issue and discussion with both XXXX and XXXX at Wellsfargo Customer Service. She explained that this is there practice and is discussed in the disclosure when you call in for a balance transfer. I said I did not call in for the balance transfer. I further stated this is a very deceptive practice set up to put the consumer in default and this violates Truth & Lending Laws. She said this is stated in my credit cards terms. However, I stated, this is not on the promotional rate offer anywhere or in the fine print. So this is deceptive. Call ended with nothing being done to alter the current minimum payment.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I called Wells fargo Financial credit card services about the late payments reported on my credit report to see if it was correct. The customer service told me "" its a bank error because they set it up to come out my account on the wrong date of the month ''. I asked them, so what do I need to do to fix the problem. They told me to fax their dispute department a letter saying "" customer service informed me that the whole time they was withdrawing money out of my account. It was set to the wrong date ''. I also had to fax them a copy of my credit report showing the late payments from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. That was last month sometime when I did that, I called wells fargo XXXX other times trying to get some help. But all they do is tell me to dispute it saying its a bank error and the dispute department will fix it. The XXXX time i called I asked them if they can just notate my account saying its a bank error since thats what they been telling me to put, and they say I have to do this on my own time they can not do it for me.

I have been with Wells Fargo for eight years and the card with one of the highest interest rates I have is theirs. I went to the bank to discuss a low interest loan to help pay it off ( they were advertising a low interest loan ). They chatted me around the block and it is now almost two week and I have not heard anything back about approval. I am now sure that I am not approved. They have taken a ton of money from me on that card and consider me a valued customer ... I guess except when I no longer want to be a cash cow for them. I realize this is my error but one would expect better treatment from a company I have had a long relationship with. Can anything be done? I was not able to upload documents on this site. I can tell you that, although I 've used this card infrequently, the interest in 2015 alone is {$720.00} and counting.

Instead of including the payment due in the payment information on the front of the statement they added a small box with the words Special Terms Expiration which did not include any amounts due and of course I did not see. When they calculated the minimum payment they conveniently assumed that I would not pay the lump sum, which resulted in the minimum payment on the front of the statement never changing, again to ensure that the statement would look identical to all of the previous statements.

Thank you for writing, XXXX XXXX '' I had provided Wells Fargo with an extensive description, verifiable evidence, and photos of the evidence of a foam insulation job by XXXX XXXX. The nature of the complaint was XXXX fold. 1.There were a large number of significant voids where the foam insulation was assumed to reach. XXXX came back to top off the upper wall areas. When an electrician was adding some receptacles to the home, we found large voids at the lower portions of the walls. 2. Later we found the foam insulation shrank 10 % in all dimensions/directions. In that shrinking process it broke up randomly inside the walls leaving variable gaps and voids. We contacted XXXX XXXX. They offered a {$2000.00} settlement, but stood silent when I asked what the repair for the shrunken insulation was. 
I had XXXX contractors listed on the internet under insulation repair come out. None wanted to estimate the repair cost, but described it as removing plaster, lath, then re-insulating and drywalling the home. 
Wells Fargo 's XXXX XXXX called. I asked if the settlement could exceed the price of the job. She said it could not. I explained that I had offered to discount the claim to {$3500.00} if XXXX if they acted BEFORE I had to write up the complaint and wait out Wells Fargo 's action. 
Since they had not responded by the time Wells Fargo wrote me to present my case, that offer was void. According to Wells Fargo, XXXX said they had offered me a {$3500.00} settlement. This is a pattern of theirs, if XXXX reads XXXX complaints against XXXX. My last proposed settlement was {$4500.00} based on {$6500.00} job, {$500.00} off the top to Wells Fargo ( their business arrangement w/vendor ) and {$1500.00} to XXXX for the {$900.00} attic insulation job they did ( they claim it 's worth {$2500.00} XXXX, and nothing for the foam injection wall insulation job that leaves me with a property defect.

Wells Fargo & Company,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we contacted Wells Fargo and spoke with XXXX to confirm the terms and conditions of an online balance transfer offer. XXXX advised us that since we had a {$10000.00} credit line on our business credit card, that we could transfer {$9800.00} to our checking account, and we would need to pay a one-time fee of 4 % of the balance transfer amount, up to a maximum of {$170.00}. XXXX further advised us that the balance transfer would have a 0 % promotional interest rate for 12 months. 
Agreeing to the above terms, we moved forward with the transfer, and were provided a reference code. 
Soon afterward, we received a letter from Wells Fargo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, confirming the details of the transfer ; however, the letter omitted any information regarding the 0 % promotional rate that XXXX had advised us that we would receive. We assumed that everything was correct, because no other rate was disclosed or specified on the confirmation letter. 
On XXXX XXXX we reviewed our XXXX/XXXX/XXXX account statement, and we noticed that we were being incorrectly charged interest on the balance transfer at a $ 23.99 % cash advance rate. We immediately contacted Wells Fargo and spoke with XXXX, and we explained the situation to her. XXXX assured us that she would submit the paperwork right away to correct the cash advance to be reversed, and instead to be re-processed as a balance transfer with a promotional 0 % rate, as we had been advised by XXXX on XXXX. XXXX further assured us that the correction would be processed within seven to ten business days. 
We heard nothing else from Wells Fargo on the matter, so naturally we were led to assume that the correction had been completed as promised. Throughout the remainder of XXXX, we had automatic payments made every month from our checking account, and we had no reason to review the electronic statements in detail. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX we prepared to pay off the promotional balance of what we assumed was the 0 % promotional rate, and we planned to do this prior to when the promotional rate was scheduled to end in XXXX. At that time, we noticed that Wells Fargo had not corrected the interest rate on the account as promised, and had instead charged us the incorrect cash advance rate of 23.99 % for a total of {$1900.00} in incorrect finance charges. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX we notified XXXX, then XXXX, then XXXX as we were getting transferred from place to place and finally ending up at the Executive Offices, with a person who should have been able to correct this situation. However, instead of correcting the situation, XXXX dismissed the situation as our fault, and basically told us that there was nothing that she could do for us except to lower the rate for a few months from the 23.99 % cash advance rate, to the only slightly less ridiculous rate of 16.24 % for purchases.

Months later, I find out that they never honored the XXXX percent APR and gave me XXXX instead. Calling Wells Fargo back to have the matter corrected, they avidly denied ever offering me the XXXX percent and when asked if they could review their recordings, there were none available for that recording ( conveniently ). I am well aware that the collections department did help lower my interest from the original amount, but the reason I agreed to shut down the card was because of the XXXX percent interest.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have received my credit card statement and my due date fell on the weekend. One was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the other was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In each case my payment was made on the first business day following the weekend. I was charged a late fee by Wells Fargo Financial. My understanding was that if the due date fell on a non business day, the payment will be due the next business day. Is this correct? 
"
Wells Fargo & Company,"1. There has been a Wells-Fargo failure to have selected and facilitated a purchaser of the past due debt on a Wells-Fargo Credit Card ( i.e., a card ending in # XXXX, that was purchased by a firm named Investment Retrievers ) to be a firm that can be relied upon to comply with the 7-year maximum Federal Law to timely correct a defaulted ( "" charge-off '' ) credit card debt reporting error in this complainant 's personal XXXX credit report. ( More specifically, this erroneous credit report listing by XXXX XXXX relates to XXXX. account beginning with # XXXX. ) This failure to remove a major negative in the credit report of this complainant after the 84th month ( i.e., after 7 years ) has continued beyond the 30-day period following XX/XX/XXXX - the date this complainant phoned in this error to XXXX and created Dispute file # XXXX. More specifically, the error is in the XXXX removal date - where XXXX has not deleted this negative from this complainant 's XXXX report after the end date of the 84th month - the date of XX/XX/XXXX in this case ( in contradiction with the facts I provided in this complainant 's phone call to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and via Faxed documents on the same date ). Apparently XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not verify the 7-year end-date to the XXXX late fee transaction posted ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) in the records of the original creditor for this debt - Wells Fargo Bank. 

2. Investment Retrievers is a debt purchaser. The original Wells-Fargo credit card for this debt ended in the acct # XXXX. 

3. The specific documentation of this XXXX late fee date ( of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) is attached to this complaint. All of the documentation for correcting this complaint error is described in a multi-page letter filed with this 4th CFPB complaint. Also provided with that letter are a number of documents, including ( a ) the recent Complainant 's XXXX credit report page that includes this error, ( b ) copies of an XXXX Invalid Dispute reply that fails to correct their error, i.e., a reply that ignores the documentation this complainant provided that irrefutably supports this complainant 's corrections, and ( c ) copies of the creditor 's contemporaneous monthly statement postings of the XXXX late fees to prove and correct this error using the books of the company that incurred these charges - this complainant 's employer. The attached letter also explains how these debts are all company debts and that none are personal ( non-business ) charges made by this complainant. This complainant is losing income because the major credit report negatives that remain in this complainant 's credit reports are preventing this complainant from successfully pursuing and securing a financial manager - or other trusted position - in the job market. 

4. This complainant 's lost income damages are also detailed in the attached letter. In summary, these damages are $ XXXX per week-day, as this complainant is a victim of fraud and as such, this complainant 's state law specifies treble damages. The damages resulting from the 7-year end date credit report errors began on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX in the case of this 2nd CFPB complaint involving the XXXX XXXX purchased Wells-Fargo credit card ending in # XXXX ( major negative ) still in this complainant 's report after that date by XXXX.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I had a secured credit card with Wells Fargo Bank. I was required to pay {$500.00} to secure the card. I asked the company to close the credit card account because they were putting charges on the card I had not authorized. They were then asked to return the collateral on the card. A check for {$500.00} was made out to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I tried to cash the check at their bank but they refused to cash the check even with proof. The company has been contacted several times but I was told lies. When I tried to get the check re-issued in the business ' name and my name they say it could not be done. The impression I have is this : they want me to open a bank account with their bank. What they would do is charge fees I have not authorize or try to mess up my credit report. I do not appreciate being muscled by irresponsible and dishonest people. I would like Wells Fargo to return the security deposit I made in good faith. I do not think they should be considered for opening a business account with their company. I want to build wealth not get ripped off.

They ca n't say a debt is still owing if they have charged it off. I want them to remove the still owing or past due balance. They are also doing this to my ex husband. They have violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act for over 3 years by re aging a debt written off and closed in XXXX. XXXX XXXX was the 180 day write off period. the FDOD was XXXX XXXX.

Wells Fargo & Company,"XXXX, a Wells Fargo company, claims I opened an account with them in early XXXX w/ a limit of {$6200.00}. I did not open this account nor did I ever use it. I would never do business with a Wells Fargo company due to their practices and consumer lawsuit history. When I saw the account on my credit report in XXXX, I called them, told them I never opened the account and insisted they close it. While they did they reported that they closed it instead of noting it was their mistake. I believe them to be a predatory company & should be investigated for same. 
"
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo closed my XXXX credit card account ending in XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX without providing me any advance notice. The problem with this is that I had earned XXXX points from purchases made with this card that were frozen that day and subsequently removed from my rewards account. These points had a cash value of {$430.00} ( XXXX cent per point ). I had no advance notice allowing me to use these points before they were revoked. In fact, I found out about my account closure by logging into the wellsfargo.com banking system and discovering it myself. A letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was mailed to me AFTER the account had been closed with the reasons cited as : Over Six Months Account Inactivity XXXX or more credit inquiries in the last 2 years on credit report Insufficient length of time accounts ( s ) on credit report has been established This card was opened on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and had been used as recently as XX/XX/XXXX, which was just over 6 months prior to the date they decided to unilaterally closed my account without advance notice. The other reasons cited for the closure are far from anything unusual and should not have resulted in any adverse action by the bank. I was also planning on using this card for upcoming travel, where I would be able to take advantage of an annual {$100.00} airline fee reimbursement credit included with this XXXX card 's benefits. 

When I contacted Wells Fargo, they said that they would not reinstate my rewards points nor would they re-open the card without me applying as if I was opening a new card ( recquiring a credit inquiry ), but I pointed out since they just closed my account due to vague credit activity, it was unlikely they would approve me for a new account. 

I believe that the state of California prevents a bank from closing a credit card that results in the loss of rewards earned without providing advance notice to allow the account holder to use those rewards. Please at least help me get my XXXX rewards points or a check for {$430.00} from Well Fargo. I would also prefer to have the account re-opened w/o incurring any credit inquiry activity, as I have also lost the annual {$100.00} airline charge benefit without being able to use it. Failing that, I also want a {$100.00} airline fee reimbursement credit to be provided to me by Wells Fargo. Thank you!

My last complaint was filed here earlier this month, Case number : XXXX, but I was recently sent the response "" We reviewed your complaint and could n't send it to the company for a response ''. You had asked for additional information to the four months of credit card statements showing the charges on my card but since I was not the renter I did not have the rental documents and I am guessing that you chose to drop my case as opposed to investigating it.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I previously filed a complaint with the CFPB and am utterly dissatisfied at the way Wells Fargo has handled it.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I disputed a charge for approx. {$1400.00} on my Wells Fargo Credit Card for an unauthorized charge with XXXX ( the merchant ). From the first phone call with Wells Fargo, I clarified to them that I did not authorize the charge. Wells Fargo subsequently concluded and found that XXXX had knowingly, and willingly, bypassed an authorization and confirmation process to force the charge through. Wells Fargo, thereby, confirmed my claim that I did not authorize the charge. Wells Fargo still refused to reverse the charge, saying I had to deal with the merchant. Even when I communicated with the merchant ( XXXX ), they agreed that they had knowingly and willingly bypassed the authorization and confirmation process to force the charge through. Subsequent analysis by me found that Wells Fargo had n't categorized it as an unauthorized charge when I had explained that to them over and again. Finally I got them to treat it as an unauthorized charge and they said they 'd look into it. I just received a letter from Wells Fargo, and their claim is that they say that I authorized the charge, when I 've been telling them from day 1 that that is not the case. Even XXXX ( the merchant ) has permanently suspended the customer account associated with the charge due to the fraud associated with this charge. XXXX is so adamant that the charge was fraud, that they wo n't even unsuspend the account upon request. Wells Fargo does not have the legal authority, especially with the prevailing evidence, to declare the charge as "" authorized '' and especially in contradiction to my declaration that it was not. Even Wells Fargo closed my account and gave me a new card! This has been going on for months because they are committing an act of "" willful blindness '' to the facts of the situation. I was legally entitled to have the charge refunded to me back in XXXX 2015! Even the merchant sees the matter as fraud, yet Wells Fargo refuses to categorize it as such. Wells Fargo does not have authority to ignore Federal Law regarding "" unauthorized charges '' on a credit card! If they are permitted to do so, think of how many other times they will simply ignore people 's claims, and unjustly enrich themselves and their merchants. Now Wells Fargo is just bullying me to pay for an unauthorized charge because they 're the big bank that can attack my credit and cancel my credit card and harm me financially, instead of admitting they made a mistake from the beginning in how they categorized the dispute. It is likely if they had categorized the matter properly in the beginning, that they would have back-charged the merchant, but since they unnecessarily dragged out the process, pursuant to their agreement with the merchant, they can no longer do that. Now, to save themselves the cost of the unauthorized charge, they bully me into footing the financial bill for their mistakes ... probably because they believe the chances are slim to none that I, or anyone else for that matter, will pursue them in any significant manner if they do n't resolve the situation in accordance with Federal Law.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo Home XXXX XXXX Credit Card Program payment calculation is deceptive beyond belief ( it is so complicated it is hard to explain it all ). We used their charge card in XXXX for windows at 0 % for 60 months no interest if paid off after 60 months. The payment was divided among 60 months. In XXXX we added a charge for Blinds that was 0 % for 12 months. What they did not explain is how the payment was calculated for the XXXX different terms. We paid every payment for every charge on time until the last charge. We did not realize that the term was slightly different for the 12 month term. The 12 month "" special rate deal amount was deferred interest, Wells Fargo only billing the minimum payment not dividing into XXXX equal payments which we would have paid off after 12 months. Instead the charge ( minimum pmt ) was combined with the 60 month term, but the statement did not show what was getting paid, as it is not separated on the bill. After 12 months it was n't paid due to misunderstanding the terms, therefore we were charged the entire year of astronomically high interest. Not only did it leave a larger balance than anticipated, but the payoff for the 12 month term was only giving the amount for that charge and did n't add in the payment for the 60 months. The interest rate immediately jumped from XXXX ( as if that is n't high enough - since our credit score is in the XXXX range ) to the 28.24 % If we had realized and paid the entire amount, we would then be short for the 60 month term because that amount is listed in small print in a separate sentence, so technically we 'd be in default on XXXX payments. The online payment option makes this very easy to overlook because you need to open the statement to realize that the Special Terms balance is due. The charge was put in my name, but my husband was paying the bills. You need a computer accounting program to figure out how the Wells Fargo bills the charges. Wells Fargo said it was up to the merchant to explain the credit card terms. We always make our payments on time and we even got caught on this XXXX. I would recommend never adding XXXX different terms to the same account. We paid off the balance today and will never, ever use Wells Fargo or any other "" Big Bank. '' We are so upset because this is pretty much close to scam as far as I am concerned. The amount due to avoid interest should be on the front page with the bill, not on the second page in a paragraph format.

By XXXX XXXX I had already made $ XXXX + in payments towards paying off the 0 % interest from XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I called to confirm my balance and I was told that the first agent gave me the wrong information ( I raised the issue to Wells Fargo customer service and I was told that they listened to the initial conversation I had with the agent, and the information provided was indeed incorrect ). I was then informed that rather than the less than $ XXXX balance I had to pay was more like {$4900.00} and that my payments were applied at a larger percentage to the second 0 % transaction I initiated which expires later in the year / XXXX XXXX.

How can I assume financial responsibility if Wells Fargo cant even give a client correct information on what they owe.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I applied for a Wells Fargo Credit Card that offered 0 % for 15 Months on balance transfers, and I was approved, and they automatically trasnferred my balance from my other card. When I get the card and statement in the mail it tells me I was approved for a "" cash back '' card, of which I did not apply, that had a rate of 22.15 %. I called and spoke with a manager who says that since I already had a credit card with them that had had a previous introductory rate offer I was not eligible for this rate offer so they approved me for another card based on my credit. I told him I didnt apply for that card nor get an opportunity to deny the card once knowing that the card would be at 22.15 % but he told me that it states that the I may not be eligible for the rate if I already had a card with them that had in the past had a introductory rate. From Wells Fargo website : "" Eligibility for Introductory Rate ( s ) and Fees : If you currently have an open credit card account or a closed credit card account with a balance issued by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., you may not be eligible for the above introductory APR ( s ) or fees. "" The problem is that even if I wasnt eligible for the card I was applying to at the 0 % how are they able to take my application and apply it to another card with another rate that I did not approve or know any terms or conditions on?

Wells Fargo & Company,"WellsFargo Bank N.A. Credit Card Limit Increased I obtained a credit card through Wellsfargo at age XXXX, upon beginning my university career. From age XXXX to the present, over XXXX seeing through my responsibility my credit card payments has been a priority. Upon losing my full time employment position in XXXX due to the recession, I was provided with a severance pay equal to a little over {$8000.00}. At the time I owed Wellsfargo Bank 's Credit Card company about {$8000.00}. I paid the balance in full. 
After I lost my middle class job in XXXX. So I worked XXXX jobs ( XXXX ) as a XXXX and ( XXXX ) for the XXXX, my income was below the poverty line. I took the XXXX and made it into XXXX School. In XXXX, a period in which I made an income lower than the poverty line and later as a XXXX student Wellsfargo continued to raise the credit limit on the credit card issued to me until it reached about {$20000.00}. In addition, while having no stable source of income and as a student they provided me with a personal line of credit in the amount of {$9000.00}. They did so, without my requesting them to do so, and without taking into consideration whether or not I was employed, nor taking into consideration my income. 
Customer Service Upon graduating from XXXX School, I was extended the great privilege of accessing a incredible job offer where my income would have been above {$90000.00} per year. The XXXX exam, however, has been a barrier. I did not pass the exam the XXXX time ( XXXX XXXX exam ). I had to take the exam a XXXX time, with no income and while unemployed, I was forced to look to my Credit Card and my Personal Line of Credit to take on that XXXX exam endeavor XXXX more time. 
Forbearance Denied Before taking the XXXX exam a XXXX time I called Wellsfargo 's Credit Card company. I explained I was unemployed, a student, and that I could foresee a struggle with payments. I requested a Forbearance similar to Federal school loans. They informed me they could do nothing to help me and was asked to pay an even greater amount of money than my original required amount that month. 
I was unemployed at the time and knew I would fall behind if I did n't get help. So I began to live off my personal line of credit, and to use it to pay my Credit Card to keep up with the payments, I simultaneously worked to find a employment and was unsuccessful. Because I had this a life changing job offer still accessible if I passed the XXXX, I felt the reasonable thing to do was to try to get the XXXX Exam again. If I passed, I 'd pay off all my debt in no time and I could provide for me and a better quality of life for my family. Sadly, I did not pass the exam the XXXX time ( XXXX XXXX ). After take the exam in XXXX I looked for work vehemently. I was unable to secure stable income until XXXX XXXX. My paychecks average {$1000.00} to {$1200.00} a month. I work 40 hours a week, 5 days a week. 
Delinquent Account I began to struggle to keep up with my credit card debt towards the end of the summer of XXXX. Once I secured employment and knew I 'd be paid in the upcoming month or so I called WellsFargo to see if we could coordinate a more manageable payment plan. The interest rates were lowered. I believed I would be able to make monthly payments of about {$350.00}. So I borrowed a significant sum from a friend and got the account caught up in the Fall of XXXX. Once I had an income {$460.00} went to rent, {$200.00} went to food, {$250.00} to gas. I was unable to to keep up. Excessive late fees have accrued, closing canceling of accounts too. I spoke to Wellsfargo representative in the recovery department yesterda, XXXX XXXX, XXXX at about XXXX. I was given XXXX options. To pay the entire sum of the credit card debt over the course of ( XXXX ) three years at {$630.00} per month or ( XXXX ) one year at a rate of {$1100.00} per month. A sale of account is planned. Help.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I just learned today from a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that there is a XX/XX/XXXX law stating that credit card companies have to give you the option of freezing your account at the current interest rate before raising it. Wells Fargo did not do that for me in XX/XX/XXXX, instead just arbitrarily raising my rate from about 12 % to 30 %, where it has been since. Had they given me that option, I would have frozen the account and it would be paid off today as it has a limit of {$2500.00}. When I left a message for my banker about this, I got no response. 

I recently got fired because I XXXX in the work place and I can not pay my rent, let alone a credit card bill. I need help. The fee for the "" non-profit '' counseling center Wells Fargo sent me to is higher each month than the 30 % interest!

Wells Fargo & Company,"Today Wells Fargo closed my credit card account. I found out when logging into my online account. No prior notification was provided. 

I made several calls to Wells Fargo on the matter. Phone agents disclosed the following reasons for account closure:XXXX Unsatisfactory relationship on a Wells Fargo checking account. This account was closed following a CFPB complaint on their payment posting process, disclosures and timeline. 
XXXX. Agents indicated Wells Fargo Risk sent a letter in early XXXX that I failed to respond to. I received no such letter and Wells Fargo Fraud agents later confirmed none was sent. 
XXXX. Cardholder abuse. 

This credit card has a marketed rewards offer of 5 % cash back unlimited for the XXXX six month. I have used this credit card to maximize this offer and suspect this is the core reason for the closure as noted in my account. 

I am fully compliant with the terms and conditions of the cardholder agreement. 

This is a clear case of Wells Fargo baiting and switching their marketing offers. 

I will further follow up with the Attorney General 's office and the Federal Trade Commission.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have had cash on demand account with Wells for the past 7 years.

Two months ago I received a letter stating that my annual fee would be assessed in the month of XXXX, and since that time I have logged onto my account weekly to look for the assessment and pay my bill. Instead, I received a very curt letter in the mail stating that I had not used the account in XXXX or more months and effective immediately my account is closed. 
I called Wells customer service to discuss having my account re-opened and offered to make a debit to keep it open. I was told they would not reopen my account but I could apply for a new account. 
Had I been notified that they were going to close my account if I did not use the card within X days, I would have happily used the card to keep the account open. 
Wells practice is detrimental to my credit score as I have been a paying customer for years, on both this card and my mortgage. By closing this account they have reduced my available credit balance by {$9500.00}. Moreover, asking me to apply for new credit instead of reopening my account will negatively impact my credit score as it will ping my SSN and show up as a new inquiry and new account, which are factors used in all XXXX of the credit bureaus ' models. 
I request that my account be reopened and that the Wells review the fairness and atrocious customer service element of this practice and the harm consumers that are not delinquent.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a credit card with Wells Fargo. At this time, I have three different promotional balance 's on my account. ( They offered special finance of 0 %, for 15 months XXXX Because they claim to apply extra payments to higher interest amounts XXXX, I mistakenly assumed they would add my extra payments to the promotional balance ending soonest. Having checked my last few statements, I see that is not the case. The majority of the money is being applied to the balances with the furthest out end date. When I contacted Wells Fargo, to inquire as to how I might stop this, so my extra payments will be used as intended, I was told that was not possible. I was told they had no way of applying the excess money to any one balance. When I pointed out that that is what they were doing, only in their favor, not mine, I just kept being told he knew how frustrating that must be! When I asked yet again, how I could have the extra money applied to those balances expiring first, he just kept telling me it was not possible. 
At this time, I have no interest charging amounts on this account, only these XXXX special finance balances, which are accruing no interest. I assume that is how they can get around applying the extra money to those amounts expiring the furthest out, but it still does n't seem right, because this will cause me to have to pay interest on these amounts, as they expire. If the extra money was being applied to those expiring first, each amount would be paid off before it expired, which was my intention. 
I would like to know if this is legal, and if so, why?

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a XXXX XXXX credit card through Wells Fargo. In XXXX XXXX, I purchased furniture under a 12-month interest-free promotion and paid it off in XXXX XXXX. In XXXX XXXX, I purchased additional furniture under another 12-month interest free promotion. My balance is {$340.00} and the promotional period ends in XXXX XXXX. My minimum payment due is {$130.00}, which would cause me to repay the loan in full by XXXX ( instead of enjoying the benefit of interest free payments with a minimum monthly payment of roughly {$65.00} until XXXX XXXX ). Wells Fargo is alleging that the furniture store set the promotional balance, and they they calculate my minimum balance differently. This practice is deceptive. I was promised the ability to make payments for 12 months interest free, but if I do n't make the minimum payment I will hurt my credit and be charged all of the interest I have saved so far.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I was offered a no interest balance transfer if paid off within 18 months as long as I made a minimum payment towards that balance transfer each month. I continued to use the card as usual for other regular purchases. Despite the fact that I regularly paid the outstanding balance in FULL and more than the required minimum payment, I was still charged interest on an unknown amount and Wells Fargo was either unwilling or unable to tell me exactly how or why they calculated the interest fees - I called twice to inquire about this issue and was not given satisfactory answers at either time. Finally, I was told that the only way to avoid interest fees was to pay the entire balance in FULL immediately. This feels like a bait and switch since I was never able to gain the benefit of the no interest offer that was made. This has happened for several billing cycles thus far.

After verifying the information he asked how he could help me as if the store associate XXXX did n't already explain it to him in great details. So I explained the situation to him once again. Only thing he help saying is it must be the register and we had to switch to the a different register. We XXXX thought that was completely odd but followed his advice. While moving to the new register I asked him was do I have XXXX separate accounts numbers for a store only card. I also stated that should be a red flag within itself. He just simply refused to answer the question and instead was more concern if we was at the new register. After I informed him that XXXX tried to process the payment twice at the new register and XXXX times it was declined he stated there was n't anything else he could do and just hung up the phone. There was no thanks for calling, can I place you on hold so I can look into this further or anything. XXXX then reached out to the store manager.

After discussing with a representative, the program auto-renews every year without notice, and requires that the account holder call and opt-out of the program to avoid a {$50.00} annual membership fee.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I believe that Wells Fargo engaged in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices ( UDAAP ) resulting in me suffering financial injury. I contacted Wells Fargo in XXXX 2015, as an existing Wells Fargo customer to inquire whether they would be able to offer me a 0 % purchase rate on a credit card. I called the customer contact center and explained to the representative that I required a credit card with 0 % interest on purchases and that I was less interested in 0 % rates on balance transfers. I did not intent to transfer a balance. I was pleased to be informed that Wells Fargo would extend an offer of 0 % interest on all purchases made using the card for 12 months and 0 % on balance transfers for 12 months. The offer could be applied to my existing Wells Fargo credit card, which, at that time, had a balance of {$0.00}. The customer representative advised me that in order to activate the 0 % interest rate on purchases, I would be require to transfer a minimum of {$100.00} to the credit card account. I thought this was an odd practice and sought clarification and I also asked the customer representative more than once to confirm that I would receive a 0 % interest rate on purchases for 12 months. He indicated that this was correct. At the direction of the customer representative, I duly transferred {$100.00} to the account and repaid the amount plus a {$5.00} balance transfer fee. I then began using my card for purchases believing that I was benefiting from a 0 % interest rate. I soon found out that this was n't the case. I was being charged an interest rate of 21.15 % apr on each purchase I had made. I contacted Wells Fargo on several occasions and found that they were unwilling to discuss the matter in detail. The initial phone calls I made when I signed up to the offer were recorded and I have been informed that these calls have been listened to twice and that "" no banker error '' was identified, I spoke with a supervisor this evening who was dismissive and informed me that 50 % of the misunderstanding lay with Wells Fargo and the other 50 % lay with me. It is my understanding that the Trust in Lending Act requires lenders to explain the terms of their credit agreements in a standardized way so that consumer can make informed choices. I believe that the opposite happened here. I believe that information which would have influenced my decision was not disclosed by Wells Fargo. I also believe that my interpretation of this agreement was reasonable in these circumstances. Ultimately, I believe that I was misled by Wells Fargo.

While I offered to pay cash the store suggested I take advantage of the 0 percent financing. We charged approximately {$1900.00} for the furniture to the new Wells Fargo account. We paid double the monthly payment for about a year and owed {$200.00} on the account on the 1 year anniversary of the charge. When our statement came in the balance was {$610.00}. A {$410.00} interest charge was added because the account was not paid off completely in the first year. I immediately paid off the {$200.00} balance and contacted Wells Fargo. They would not remove any of the interest even though the account was paid in full within 15 days of the 1 year anniversary of the charge. I can not imagine how this could be a legal business practice. We were never made aware of what would happen after one year, and if we were, we would have never opened the account. We could have just as easily paid cash. I feel as if I have be mugged by someone on the street and my wallet stolen. Why is this practice allowed?

It took another several calls before the calls finally ceased. Today, after almost XXXX year later, I received another call from Wells Fargo trying to contact XXXX XXXX. Obviously they have never up-dated their records. Why must I be getting these phone calls just because Wells FargoXXXX, etc. were XXXX enough to give this person credit?

Wells Fargo & Company,"For years I had credit limits over XXXX. Then the credit crunch came and many non used accounts were just closed and credit limits reduced in a one way transactions. The banks just reduced credit limits. I been working with social security XXXX and have just been approved after a 3 year period of struggle. Now I have Wells Fargo reducing my credit limit without any notice. Just boom. The credit market is so tight, its totally out of control. These big bank officers should have been put in jail for the great recession, just like the savings and loan scan.dal in the 1980 's. Now out of the blue, Wells Fargo lowered my credit limit, again restricting and reducing credit scores and credit limits. Absolute control by the rich and powerful XXXX!

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a credit card through Wells Fargo Bank. I reached my limit and came to a payment agreement with them that I would no longer be able to charge on my card. They are taking automatic deductions from my checking account. However, once they started doing that they stopped sending me statements in the mail. I tried opening an online account so I can keep track of the account and the site would not allow me to do so. I called them to ask them to help me set up an online account and they told me that because the account was "" over charged '' and had been closed, that they would no longer provide me with or allow me to open an online account. The only way they offered for me to follow the progress of my payments was to call them monthly and they would tell me what my balance is. Can they take money from me without giving me a written method of following the account? For all I know, the money could be going to another account or being put into someone 's personal account. I want to be able to open an online account so I can check on the balance and make sure my money is being applied to my account.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I signed up for a Wells Fargo Credit Card with the understanding that it came with a Cell Phone Protection. According to the Wells Fargo reps, I simply submit a claim with them, and XXXX would take care of the claim and have everything processed within 7 days. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I notified them of damage beyond repair to my phone. Now Wells Fargo is sending me to another company called XXXX XXXX XXXX ( whose website says they are Asurion, but the phone rep from XXXX XXXX XXXX repeatedly tells me that they are in no way, shape, or form associated with Asurion ). XXXX XXXX XXXX repeatedly denies my claim saying that XXXX requires me to get an estimate from XXXX on the repair/replacement cost of the phone. They said that XXXX will "" ship me a box free of charge, evaluate my phone, and give me an estimate of repair. '' XXXX XXXX XXXX continually tells me that I must go through XXXX for this repair. XXXX on three occasions has said that all they can provide is an estimate that the phone is beyond repair and that the full replacement cost is {$540.00}, and has given me this documentation. XXXX says they have never heard of a company requiring so much info, as XXXX XXXX XXXX is requesting. 
The representative at Card Benefit Services notified me there is no way for me to directly speak with the Claims Administrator, told me that she personally is the highest point of contact and I can not speak to anyone of her superiors, they are not a part of Asurion ( though the website claims different ), and that all correspondence takes at least 5 business days to look at. Wells Fargo informed me that they never intended for the process to be this complicated. Card Benefit Services referred me to Wells Fargo as they said it is in my Terms & Conditions that I will have to jump through many hoops to get a replacement device. I called Wells Fargo, whom went over my Terms & Conditions, and there was nothing as such in there. I called back to XXXX XXXX XXXX who said they do not have anything in writing as to their process, their contract with XXXX, nor a listing of documents that they request from the customer. She then told me I would have to contact XXXX for their terms & services. I asked if they can give me a legally binding document in writing or a Terms & Conditions, to which they said no, they just give verbal information. Now, they are telling me that I must travel 6 hours away to an actual XXXX XXXX to have my phone evaluated. None of this is in my Terms & Conditions. I feel that I was baited with this card benefit, then had everything switched on me when I try to use the benefit. 
XXXX says they do not know of any contract that they have drawn up with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that they would not require me to send the phone to them for evaluation, as the replacement program is through my credit card company, not XXXX XXXX. XXXX says on fully replacement phones, they do not evaluate them for repair as they are not repairable. On two occasions, XXXX has provided me with Replacement Estimates, to which XXXX XXXX XXXX accused me of taking a "" screen shot '' of a replacement phone website. This estimate is from a bonafide estimate from XXXX that was prepared directly for me - twice. 
Wells Fargo promises rewards with their credit cards, then does not stand behind them. This is an unethical practice that must be corrected quickly.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I had a secured credit card with Wells Fargo. XX/XX/2015, I received a letter to inform me that i I had graduated to an unsecured credit card and the collateral of {$300.00} was going to be refunded to me as well as my limit increasing to {$600.00}. The letter informed me that I would be receiving these funds via a check in the mail within 30 days. XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I went to a branch to enquire about wether they had sent my check. They advised to wait the complete 30 days. 
I went into a branch XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with the branch manager. He advised that the check had been cut on XX/XX/XXXX, confirmed the address ( which I received other mail from Wells Fargo in the mean time ) and attempted to advocate for my funds to be direct deposited to the account. The credit services lady said that they were not able to do so and that I would need to have another check issued and sent out. I was advised that this process would take 2 weeks. Because I was moving states within that time frame, the branch manager recommend I provide him with my new address in order to receive the check there. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I had still not received my check so I contacted the customer care phone number. They reconfirmed my address and had the correct one on file. Essentially, they advised that the 2 week period was 14 business days and that date coincided with XX/XX/XXXX and that it would be best to wait until XX/XX/XXXX before contacting them to action. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received my check so I decided to go into my local branch. The banker called credit services on my behalf and requested a direct deposit into my checking account with Wells Fargo and to cancel the second check I had never received. The lady he was speaking to filed appropriate papers while we were on the phone with her and advised that I did not need to fill anything out. I was advised that I would receive my funds within 3-5 business days. 
Monday XX/XX/XXXX, I called because the funds STILL had not hit my account. The guy I was speaking too explained that I would need to sign an affidavit to which I explained that the lady the banker and I spoke with said it was n't necessary as it had been done on the phone. He explained that this was a requirement and offered to send one to me via mail to take care of. After reiterating what had been done at the branch, he said he would call me back with information that afternoon as he would need to enquire further. I never received a call back. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I went into my branch AGAIN ( fourth time ) and spoke with my banker. He called credit services to find out what the delay was. They advised him that the phone call I had made the previous day had spurred them to action and the paperwork HAD NOT BEEN FILED until that day. Because of this, I would need to WAIT ANOTHER 3-5 BUSINESS DAYS! 
This is in no way shape or form how to deal with customers. I have monthly fees taken out of my account for their "" service '' yet they ca n't give me my collateral back in a timely manner. 
The branch manager has filed an internal complaint which has since been escalated to the "" executive level ''.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I thought I was applying for a balanced transfer but instead it was a cash advanced. In addition they never calculate or show during the process a fee for a transfer ( actual cash advanced ) the amount for the transfer ( cash advanced ) until after the transfer ( actual cash advanced ) It says transfer everywhere, they talk of balance transfer, no mention anywhere Cash Advanced, I was told 3 days later at the bank office it was not a Balanced Transfer but Cash Advanced. different fees, different monthly payments every month. How deceptive. I was told by someone in the Corporate office I could get it changed once I paid it off. Give me a lie then I have to pay for that. Why are they allowed to run a XXXX XXXX like that? 
Solution : They should be made to place cash advanced description on there website in big bold print, capital letters. There is a reason its not there. How sad to deceive people in such way, why are they allowed to even have a banking business.

Wells Fargo & Company,"The credit line on my Wells Fargo visa was lowered from XXXX to XXXX because my credit bureau report in XXXX 2016, showed unusually high balances. However, all of these balances have been paid off in full or were due to fraudulent activity on my credit cards. My credit bureau report as of now shows ZERO balance due on ALL my credit cards ; my credit shows PERFECT now as it should. It is not right that Wells Fargo should penalize me by lowering my credit line due to unauthorized fraudulent activity out of my control that showed temporarily on my credit bureau reports. There are fraud alerts on all XXXX of my credit bureaus now to prevent this from happening again. My credit bureaus shows perfect again with XXXX balance due on all my credit cards. I request that in fairness Wells Fargo reinstate my proper credit line of at least {$10000.00}.

Wells Fargo & Company,"WellsFargo gouges their consumers by playing fast and loose with the dates when they close credit card billing cycles : they close the billing cycle earlier than they are supposed to thus not applying payments made on the last day of the business cycle towards the outstanding balance and therefore calculating higher monthly payments than they would otherwise have calculated had they closed the billing cycle on the day when they were supposed to. This gouges the customer twice : first, it calculates the minimum payment on the basis of a higher balance ; second, because they 've already calculated a minimum amount due the following month before the current billing cycle actually closed, they take the payment made on the last day of the billing cycle and apply it first towards paying this higher, fraudulently calculated payment, and only apply the remainder towards the balance. In addition, they never actually communicate when the billing cycles end to customers until after the fact. I had to call them and ask them to give me the last dates when I could make payments on my account. According to those days I should still have been able to apply a payment I made today towards the balance on my account but lo and behold, when I went online to make that payment ( I had planned to pay down {$1800.00} ) they had already calculated my minimum payment due next month. I called them about it again and now they are telling me that the business cycle ends not at midnight on the dates they had given me before but at XXXX am the day before. ( What?!?!?!? ). 
This has happened repeatedly with Wells Fargo, which is why I decided to call them and find out from them when exactly I could make my payments. They calculate interest on average on {$2000.00} more each month than they should, thereby costing me $ XXXX/month.

Wells Fargo & Company,"After discovering this issue while trying to apply for a new mortgage, I tried the customer service numbers online. Each one was a dead end nobody seemed to know who to talk to about this issue at Wells Fargo. I closed the accounts in person and they do n't tell me that I still owe money?! I ended up going into the branch where I got some actual customer service. The lady worked with me to try and get me to talk with the correct people and actually appeared to be making progress to resolve this while I was sitting in the branch. The best customer service that I ever experienced at Wells Fargo. Before leaving, we submitted a letter to the credit department and they said that within 10 days they would resolve the issue with the credit bureaus. 9 days passed and I checked in to make sure that I could still expect the 10 days that I had been promised for this issue to be resolved. She broke the news to me that the process had n't been started since the paperwork was not transferred properly. At this point, I was up against a deadline and needed resolution immediately. It was going to be another 10 business days before I could even think about it being resolved. I spoke with a manager to see if there was anything else that could be done and spoke with one other department. The final outcome was that Wells Fargo would not admit any fault in not closing my accounts properly, not reporting to me that they believed I was late on payments, and causing my credit score to drop a substantial amount. I believe that going into a bank and talking with a banker to close accounts should be the most foolproof way to properly close accounts. This is not the case with Wells Fargo. In addition to not closing properly, there were not any phone calls made to me explaining the situation ( that they did n't properly close my accounts ) until they had already negatively reported against me. In the end, I 'm going to pay a higher interest rate on a 30 year loan over $ XXXX due to Wells Fargo 's negligence in properly closing accounts and properly contacting me when something was not up to standard on my account.

There is no option to unsubscribe on the email, I then called the customer service number provided on the email, that customer service could not help me opt out so I was then transferred to Premier help line, they could n't help me then I sent to online banking help line, they could not help me so then they sent me to credit card customer service and then the line disconnected, I then call the credit card customer service directly and had to wait 9 minutes to talk to someone. I finally reached a credit card representative, they too could not help me, I was then transferred to the rewards customer service line. They too could not help me, I was told I could n't opt out receiving this news letter only, my only option is to discontinue receiving all email communications from the bank which is ridiculous because I hold my checking, savings, mortgage, HELOC, XXXX account too. Finally, I was required to re-authenticate every time I was transferred so I had to authenticate myself a total of five times.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I used Wells Fargo credit cards for nearly a year. I was rewarded for being one of their best customers. I received letters encouraging me to spend more. When I would call, I would be thanked for my high levels of use and encouraged to see a banker and be a part of the Wells Fargo family. Without notice in XXXX, my credit card was shut down for suspected rewards abuse. I 'm not even sure what this is. There was a note in the letter that I had received a warning already. This is simply not true. If there is documentation about me receiving a warning, I 'd love to see it. I did not receive an initial letter warning me. If I had, I would have called immediately to discuss this. They said they did not like my purchase and payment behavior - but were not willing to share this. 
Their decision to close my credit card without warning required me to forfeit nearly {$20000.00} dollars in travel rewards. Rewards that they earned money on through my choice to swipe with their card instead of a different card - like my XXXX XXXX business card. 
I am hoping someone at Wells Fargo realizes this is a mistake - I did not receive a warning letter - and is willing to reinstate my rewards. I understand it is their prerogative to close my account, and I accept that and I have chosen a different bank - if they do n't want to do business with me after calling me a top tier customer and a great customer and encouraging me to spend even more - that 's fine. I am a capitalist at heart, and I believe business is a two way street. However, stealing {$20000.00} dollars from me crosses the line. We are at a level where I feel compelled to do whatever I need to do to fight for this - given the deceptive nature of offering me rewards, still sending me emails offering me their services ( I just received an email AFTER my card was closed offering me a 5 % wells fargo mortgage card for being one of their BEST customers!! ). This is conflicting information. On one hand, Wells Fargo rewards me for my spend, verbally thanks me in calls for the spend, invites me to come speak to a banker because of my spend and balances - and then on the other hand, closes my credit card and steals {$20000.00} in rewards saying they can do this because of terms and conditions and they warned me. Again, there was no warning. If there was, I would like the tracking number, notification in my online account or recorded phone call where it occurred. I went and double checked my online messages, and I get messages frequently about aspects of my wells fargo experience ( like confirming authorized users ) but there is absolutely XXXX warning listed in there. 
I am hoping Wells Fargo will do the right thing - award me my past rewards, and hopefully we can rebuild our relationship. If not, given that there was no warning, there was lots of enticement of of the rewards and the relationship, I will have to consider escalating. I am hoping Wells Fargo will reach out and fix this as a one time courtesy - given that they are still requesting my business and we can restore our relationship. I can understand though they are withholding XXXX from me - they are enriching themselves by not paying out rewards - but given that they earned THEIR swipe fees from me - it would be a troublesome marketing issue to withhold points.

Wells Fargo & Company,"In XXXX XXXX I requested a balance transfer in the amount of {$4500.00} ( 0 % APR till XXXX XXXX with 4 % one-time balance transfer fee ). It was approved by my Wells Fargo credit card and I paid {$180.00} balance transfer fee in XXXX XXXX. At that time I also had a balance of {$1700.00} as a result of my credit card purchases. In XXXX XXXX I made a payment in the amount of {$1800.00} to pay off my credit card purchases. I assumed that Wells Fargo would no longer charge me interest fees as I already paid for my purchases and for my balance transfer. In XXXX XXXX my balance was {$4200.00}. However, later I discovered that they were charging me interest fees. Overall during the next 4 months they charged me {$70.00} in interest fees. 
At the XX/XX/XXXX I called them and was assured that this is a mistake ( usually clients ' payments apply to a higher-interest balances ). They promised me to look into that again and fix everything within 3-4 business days. About a week later I called them again and they took completely different position. They told me that they divided my XXXX payment between my balance transfer and my purchases balance ; therefore, they charged me interest fees. I did not plan to pay my balance transfer in full or partially before XXXX XXXX. I only planned to make minimum payments.

Then I asked if they could provide me with a invoice for services rendered on my card on the date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and why they would have charged me.

I explained to her that I had an erroneous charge on my card and that I 'd like to get some more information on what services they provided me and some paper work or an invoice for services rendered. She told me that she could not. At that point I called my Credit card company, Wells Fargo, with my financial advisor on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. They told me that they have a {$0.00} fraud liability protection clause. I explained to them that I had no business with this company and was not sure how they got my information but I would like to file a fraud claim against this company.

Wells Fargo & Company,"We experienced a fraudulent transaction on our business account in XXXX XXXX. This transaction was initiated by a former employee who was not authorized to make such a transaction. 

After reporting it, this transaction was reversed but due to the failure of Wells Fargo business banking specialist, XXXX XXXX, to remove this individual 's access to the account, the identical transaction was processed in early XXXX XXXX. After reporting it once again, this time Wells Fargo did not address the issue. 

Instead, I was locked out of our account and not granted access despite providing the documentations proving that I was the only authorized individual to access this account. Despite repeated requests, I was unable to access our accounts until I escalated this matter to the regional supervisor, XXXX. 

After investigating, XXXX eventually reversed the second charge as well. This took place in XXXX XXXX, five months after the fraudulent transaction was reported. 

As soon as I regained access to our accounts, I made the outstanding payments on our credit cards. I then became aware, however, that our credit cards were closed to delinquency and all of our points have been forfeited. 

I was only unable to make these payments because Wells Fargo had revoked my access to the accounts. I made the payments as soon as I regained access and I was assured by XXXX XXXX that our accounts would not be closed until we had the opportunity to redeem these points.

Unknowingly, when Dillards would call about my payment being a day late I would immediately pay over the phone and was told by the representative to resign back up with the online payment center. This happened at least 3 times. While I was believing that my payments were finally going through because I setup automatic payments again by taking step by step directions from a representative. To end the story, a final and fourth representative told me every time I signed up, it was taking two billing cycles to activate. So the 2 month cycle wait kept restarting and the horror would not stop. Meanwhile, they stated I was {$7.00} dollars past due and now it was on my credit report for XX/XX/2015.

I also had bank accounts with wells fargo, as the enclosed paperwork there is a XXXX page summary of issues leading up to my encounter with wells fargo secured card. wells fargo bank was aware that we were idenity theft and robbed and I was adding my partner XXXX XXXX to my account, in order to do this, as my credit was better than his, we would have to be downgraded to a very weak checking account with wells fargo that did not offer us as many benefits and had horrible limitations, even though my credit was good aside from all issues with robbery and theft, wells saw paperwork I brought it into office, police reports and the whole nine and still gave us a checking account that ended up causing major issues. In light of all that we still need to put our lives back together after fallout,, and all the many many issues with WELLS FARGO CREDIT CARD, and such, if WELLS FARGO SECURED CARD takes care of the outstanding issues. First off, WELLS FARGO made {$330.00} in fees on my secured card as I put in document, they made this in just THREE MONTHS, in total they made over {$1700.00}. The issue is, I had {$200.00} limit to start, {$200.00} limit take out of machine, I paid on time and every time perfect. So much so, that I ended up with {$1000.00} secured card. But, there were issues with disputes from get go which I will go into in the resolution part. Every dispute that was made, either had witness, or turned in paperwork, or had proof of the issue and there were over XXXX all together. Several companies I canceled a membership and I alerted WELLS, the company would following month try to put it through again. I would have to call company again, then wells, and each dispute, wells would credit, then take back, then recredit then take back. Even after I would spend hours with XXXX issue, and I have phone records and emails to prove it, it doesnt take a brain trust to figure it out, XXXX was XXXX companies kept trying to recharge, several months in row, if I talked to company or not, it would be pretty clear I canceled subscription if even lets say first time it was my fault, which it wasnt. I can prove I spent well well over hundreds of hours dealing with this insane issues. I would go use the card, and the money that I thought was there, sometimes hundreds of dollars, would nbe taken back of card for dispute that they already told me was closed and in my favor. So on top of making XXXX 15 calls a dispute I would have to call over the dispute being taking away as well. Many times I Was XXXX with no balance on card even though I paid my balance every time it got low, sometimes 5 or more times a month. And there were many other issues, like WELLS called me and said there was some really strange activity on my card, and it did not look like they were my charges, there was over {$700.00}. I looked, and my card was gone, at this time we still dealing with idenity theft issues, but I could have dropped the card somewhere and someone picked it up, we were experiening a lot less idenity theft issues, and there was no one around me and I tried keep all cards and such far from anyone take, so I could dropped it, She cut card off just in case, and when I Got new XXXX not only few days later WELLS cut card off without notifying me with {$650.00} in disputes from up to 2 years prior that they took back off my card even after dispute was "" CLOSED '', there was {$700.00} in new issues which I was still trying figure out if indeed t was someone I may known, and NO it was not. And there was ton of weird fees all over place."
Wells Fargo & Company,"We closed our previous Wells Fargo Cash-back credit card ( with XXXX balance/credit ) so that we can take advantage of the Rewards Visa Signature credit card with six months promotional XXXX % rewards on Grocery, Gas Station, and Drugstore purchases. Wells Fargo employed the bait-and-switch tactics to deny our promotion without any rationale. 
XXXX We demand WF provide us the promised full six-month promotion on our new WF XXXX Visa Signature card!!"
Wells Fargo & Company,Wells Fargo charged a credit fee of XXXX on a balance of XXXX
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have been disputing a credit card account, that does no belong me, that was reported to all credit bureaus by Wells Fargo. The credit card belongs to my cousin who has had this card for more than 15 years, and in 2007, it appeared on my credit report. He called Wells Fargo to inform them that the card belong to him and should not be on my credit report. They told him all they could do is cancel the card but it will still show on my account negatively. He still use this card today. All these years this has effected my credit, my ability to get jobs, new credit, and most importantly, I have had to make some challenging life decisions because of this neglect from Wells Fargo."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have an account with XXXX promotional balances. XXXX promotion is scheduled to end on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the other on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Prior to opening the XXXX promotional balance my minimum payment was around {$85.00} once the second account was open my minimum payment went up to {$100.00}. Because my promotional balance is due in XXXX XXXX I made a large payment to avoid being charged. {$450.00} in interest. After the payment was made. Wells Fargo changed the minimum payment on XXXX balances without notification and is only applying {$2.00} of my payments to the balance that is about to expire. 

The summary of my complaint is Wells Fargo changed the terms of our agreement without notifying me, and they apply an unfair amount of my payment to an account where it is n't required with the purpose of collecting an extra amount in interest."
Wells Fargo & Company,"**NEW INFORMATION** DUNNING LETTER DATED XX/XX/XXXX ATTACHED Relating to original case numbers XXXX and XXXX. Creditor/furnisher 's response and continuance of reporting obsolete account information to CRAs violates FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) and 605 ( c ) per FTC docs attached as well as ORIGINAL DUNNING LETTER FROM CREDITOR ATTACHED. 

The response to original dispute from Creditor/Furnisher validates re-aging of the DOFD to the month prior to the Chapter XXXX discharge which is a violation of FCRA 605 ( c ). The FTC is clear on how to calculate the running period ( several FTC "" Notices to Furnishers '' are attached ). The FTC is clear that the DOFD must remain unchanged & that any subsequent actions such as charge-off or discharge are irrelevant to the DOFD, yet creditor/furnisher has stated, in writing, that they have re-aged the account by changing the DOFD. 
1 ) Dunning letter from creditor/furnisher dated XX/XX/XXXX where DOFD for account is at least 90 days prior to date of letter, which is XX/XX/XXXX. 
2 ) Creditor/furnisher reported "" Date Account Closed : XX/XX/XXXX '' which has been omitted/changed and re-aged to date of Chapter XXXX discharge which violates FCRA. 
3 ) FTC definition and remarks on FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) and 605 ( c ) clearly define the actions all furnishers/CRAs must adhere to for obsolete accounts, which this creditor/furnisher is in violation of. 
4 ) Creditor/Furnisher delayed chargeoff by 44 months post-DOFD, partial pmts were made, the account was never brought current therefore the DOFD must remain unchanged and the charge off/discharge date is irrelevant. 
5 ) The creditor/furnisher continues reporting an invalid date of XX/XX/XXXX for DOFD after consumer has disputed this information and provided adequate documentation for reasonable investigation of the account status as delinquent in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Creditor/furnisher violates FCRA if they fail to report the original DOFD within the required timeframe ( 90 days from DOFD ). If creditor/furnisher uses the date of discharge from Chapter XXXX BK they 're committing re-aging of the account through changing the DOFD. Either way, the creditor/furnisher is violating the FCRA as it prohibits creditors/furnishers from ever changing the DOFD per attached FTC Reports and opinion letters. FTC Staff Report ( 40 years of FCRA ) verbiage specifically states "" Section 605 ( a ) ( 4 ) prohibits furnishers from reporting "" Accounts placed for collection or charged to profit and loss which antedate the report by more than seven years ''. 

Section 605 ( c ) # 3 ( page XXXX ) specifically states "" 3. EVENTS OTHER THAN "" COMMENCEMENT OF THE DELINQUENCY '' IRRELEVANT : The period is calculated from the date specified in this section, not subsequent events such as ( a ) the date the creditor first reported the chargeoff or a collection to the CRA ; ( b ) the dates of payments made or missed during the delinquency that leads to the chargeoff or collection ; ( c ) the date of sale or transfer of the account from the original creditor to another creditor ; or ( d ) the date a consumer disputes the debt. '' All creditors/furnishers where accounts were discharged in Chapter XXXX have removed their account tradelines from credit file in accordance ( and unprompted ) with the FCRA. If this creditor/furnisher 's explanation to original dispute were accurate, all other accounts would have remained on credit file yet they do not, they 've been correctly removed due to their obsolescence. The Remediation Analyst who contends reporting this account is valid is XXXX XXXX at XXXX ext. XXXX, she is from the Executive Office of the creditor/furnisher, though it 's concerning that the EO does n't seem to understand the running period requirement as defined in FCRA 605 ( c ). I 've taken the liberty of attaching the FTC Staff Reports and opinions regarding similar disputes in an effort to assist XXXX XXXX with her interpretation."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I hired insulation company to inject foam into my walls and they offered me a loan through Wells Fargo with 0 % on 5 years. They were hired with promise of XXXX % savings in utility bills, more comfortable home ( plaster walls can get cold ) and no allergens but in return they destroyed walls, created moisture and mold, negative pressure ( moth ball smells and fireplace creosote backup ), utility bills are higher than they were and I contacted them a week after the job was done to complain. They promised to fix but disappeared after 3 days and doing more damage to my walls. Same day XXXX/XXXX/2015 when they did n't show up I received a call from Wells Fargo about the charge and I explained what had happened and asked they dispute. I was told I do not owe anything, paperwork has been completed and if XXXX XXXX tries to charge again it will not go through without my approval. I received the first bill on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and have been disputing since providing multiple proof documents ( energy audit with thermal images, pictures of damage, HVAC report, environmental report ). I provide so much proof, explanations, people that did the reports to speak with them, for Wells Fargo person to come by the house and walk through however I do not get any questions, answers or proof back besides these answers from Wells Fargo : - XXXX Insulation states they repaired the damages therefore we consider this dispute closed ( Not true and no proof was provided so they are taking their word for it ) - XXXX Insulation states you signed a contract so they send me a copy of the contract ( which I already have and provided to them as my proof ) and checklist ( which does not have my signature and I never saw until Wells Fargo sent to me ). They dispute again however dispute is in regards to job creating issues because it takes up to XXXX hours for the foam to cure which is when the problems started and i complained a week after. 
- Newest one is XXXX XXXX claims they filled XXXX walls which were not part of the contract but were completed free of charge. Again no proof or mention what they are referring to while ignoring thermal images proving foam is missing in many places. 
Excuses and excuses and the worst part is Wells Fargo will not call me, will not answer my questions I ask and they are supporting whatever XXXX Insulation SAYS without any proof. Pictures and professionally done audits that I had to pay for are not good enough. There is some connection between Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX for them to back them up so consistently. If I had paid with any other credit card or loan this would have been resolved long time ago. I will have to gut my walls ( XXXX other insulation companies I asked for fix will not have anything to do with it unless everything is gutted and cleaned out ) to resolve the negative pressure, allergens and moisture problems. I 've received a quote for some fancy computerized furnace and AC at cost of {$18000.00} on top of what it will cost me to gut the walls and re-insulate and possibly find other things inside walls when they are open due to moisture. I asked to get XXXX Insulation insurance contact info to file a claim and once my home is repaired i will pay the fees I owe. This was not even addressed just like any of my other questions and concerns. 
It has been going on for a year now and we can not deal with health issues any longer ( XXXX ) which we did not have in the last 9 years so i am requesting that this {$7300.00} is charged back to XXXX XXXX. Residential legal action takes 2 years or more and cost is not contingent on wining the case so i can not risk spending everything i have on legal fees and still have to repair the home at my cost in the end or it dragging out longer but if necessary will go that route."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I received a letter from Wells Fargo today that my credit card was closed for inactivity. I am unable to access online statements associated with this account, even though Wells Fargo 's website says that online statements would be available for 2 years. I want my account reinstated/reopened. And I want Wells Fargo to fix their website so that I can view my online statements from this account again. Under Truth in Lending Regulations ( Z ), credit card companies are required to furnish periodic statements and have proper record retention practices. If I ca n't access my statements from year 2015, they are in violation of these regulations. These companies always want people to switch from paper to paperless statements as a cost savings and convenience measure. However, when it 's time to access the online statements, they 're unavailable."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I called 7 times in last month, faxed emailed over XXXX times last year and they refuse to talk over phone. Why? They know they have to pay out and were wrong, now they illegally reported my to TRANSUNION which they reported positive for over a year and my account been closed for over a year, this is not ONLY ILLEGAL, but my credit dropped over XXXX points and now I can not get my car loan or job I Was up for this, this is so serious, I will have to now ask for XXXX dollars if they do not call and fix both issues asap. This situation is not over until I get paid, I love how WELLS FARGO sends fraud proof to consumerfinance.gov thinking they can take my rights away, I HAVE PROOF OF THEIR illegal activity and the fact they would not call me to talk about this they sent some shady mail to me that was full of worthless repent and even proved I am right, there are many many issues other ones I can right here as I have not enough room. I was hoping WELLS FARGO would have come its sense and realize that it 's calling ME, the card holder, the consumer and customer a liar. But in essence, knowing full well all the issue we had with identity theft and precautions we need to now take, and knowing full well WELLS FARGO made well over {$350.00} just in 3 months of over 12 months I had the card. I did not complain about the {$10.00} atm charge you charged me every time I used the card or your high interest rates. And I was never late once with my bill. Not to mention I can show with phone records and emails how many times I had to call in to WELLS FARGO to handle simple small issues over and over and over again. I can promise you as well over two hours a week was spent dealing with issues that I was told once I signed the forms would be handled. And they never did, they always came back. As well I also There were several disputes on the card that were active when WELLS FARGO closed the card down. And oddly the card just so happened to equal {$1000.00} which was my deposit. 

I have lost XXXX with every company, not only not caring of my extreme identity theft issues, but taking advantage of our situation when we paid our bills and we stayed in contact with each company every issues doing whatever company policies were, but in the end, those things never mattered either. 

So, I let all those issues go, all those many many many issues. And I told you guys I was willing work with you, but you, again, WELLS FARGO has found a way to call the consumer who took the time to call right away when there was an issue on the card, a liar. So, I your customer, lied to you about the {$200.00} ATM dispute in XXXX. Cause what you told me was the MERCHANT saw me take the money of the machine. Well let me rectify this again for you, and I Will not discuss other disputes again, I am simply going go over this XXXX ATM at roughly XXXX at a convenient store located across from XXXX, next to XXXX XXXX -"
Wells Fargo & Company,This is the third time for filing this complaint. After each contact Wells Fargo has given me a different story of why I was sent a {$300.00} dollar check on an account that was sold to a collection agency. This last time the collection agency told me that Wells Fargo told them that it was for overpaid interest. I have attached a letter and all of the information including the new information received.
Wells Fargo & Company,Dillards is reporting that I have a balance. When I called. there is no record of me.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I experienced identity theft and notified Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. They have reported to the credit reporting services that upon investigation, they had decided that I was in serious delinquency even though they knew about the identity theft. After notifying them of the theft, the thief was able to open a credit card at Wells Fargo under my name and rack up additional debt. I immediately informed them that I did not open this card and had they looked at my account, they would 've been able to identify the continued identity theft. Instead, they took more than {$6000.00} out of my checking account to pay the balance on this fraudulent credit card. And now Wells Fargo is claiming, I owe them {$3800.00} which is destroying my credit. They also never repaid a penny of the theft which was laundered through my bank account. They only saw the problem when I went into the branch to make an inquiry about my account. Wells Fargo claimed it was my problem. XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX claimed I owed an amount that was also part of the identity theft. I provided them with two police reports about the identity theft and a notarized FTC proclamation about the theft. This too continues to destroy my credit. I 've employed many credit repair service to no avail. In fact, they take the debts off my credit report and then put them back on. And XXXX was paid in full and apparently that payment went to a different payment address and it took XXXX three months to get the payment credited to my account. They have put this on my credit report as late payments. Well Fargo Bank Line of Credit put late payments as "" seriously delinquent '' even though I was in a modification of the loan which Wells Fargo said I did not have to pay until the modification was complete. During the modification progress, Wells Fargo continued to ask for more and more paperwork which I did provide but nothing happened with the modification until I got a refinance loan and paid them off. No matter what I do, I can not get my credit score to what it was prior to the identity theft."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I am on a credit card with Wells Farcgo as an authorized user that I did not sign up for. This is effecting my credit in a negative manor. I have spent over 4 hours on the phone with Wells Fargo trying to fix this. Most of my time spend during this wasted time was verifying who I was and getting transferred and hung up on. They even sent me into a bank branch because they were sure that would resolve my issue. I drove all the way to bank only to be told that they do not deal with credit cards. On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and spoke with XXXX employee # XXXX ref # for call - XXXX - He was supposed to send me proof that I should be on this account and teh proof was never received. Finally, after wasting over 6 hours of my time, I have decoded to file a report."
Wells Fargo & Company,"To whom it may concern, On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I setup a one time on line payment of {$300.00} to make a payment on my credit card which is a Wells Fargo card. The payment was scheduled for XXXX/XXXX/2016 with a due date of XXXX/XXXX/2016. 
I logged into my account XXXX/XXXX/2016 to confirm the transaction and noticed Well Fargo withdraw {$600.00} from my checking account. Transactions XXXX and XXXX. 
I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX and was told Wells Fargo can not do anything until the transactions post and that I should call XXXX/XXXX/2016 to receive my {$300.00}. 
I asked how did this happen to which she replied, I do n't know, but can see that I setup just XXXX {$300.00} transaction. The horror began when I called back on XXXX/XXXX/2016. 
I was told by a manager, XXXX, I believe her name to be. I was told XXXX transaction will be reversed, but will have to wait up to10 business days for my funds to be returned to my XXXX bank account. Without any doubt in my mind had the bank inadvertently given me {$300.00} the funds would have been immediately withdrawn from my account that day. 
I explained I need the money to pay electric, water, phone, insurances bills etc. etc. XXXX reply was there is NO other option she could afford me and that I have to wait. That alone is atrocious. Being a husband and father of XXXX children, the cash was truly needed. With today 's technology I 'm sure the money could have been returned immediately. Or perhaps all banks work in this fashion, I do n't know. 
Essentially, Wells Fargo, in my opinion stole {$300.00} from my banking account without my permission, have no reasonable explanation as to how it happen and I have no option but to wait up to 10 days for my money. 
I placed my trust in Wells Fargo and was deceived as they basically turned around and as I feel stole from my account and forced XXXX option down my throat, wait for your money. 
Wells Fargo blatantly took my {$300.00} from my account and I 'm forced to wait up to ten days for Wells Fargo to return my money. I guess you can call it a small loan. If Wells Fargo did this to XXXX people over a ten day span which is easy to do, for I 'm proof of that, that would amount to a small loan of {>= $1,000,000}. Imagine what you could do with that amount of money of a 10 day period. 
I believe this practice is unscrupulous and turns innocent people such as myself into victims. 
Under no circumstances should this have ever happened and to hear Wells Fargo explain they have no reasonable explanation is absurd. 
I 'm writing this letter asking the banking committee to investigate this matter and put an end to this ridiculous practice."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I took out a Wells Fargo "" Home Rebate '' credit card to help supplement the payments to my mortgage with Wells Fargo. Their product description can be summarized in this way : Purchasing goods/services with the credit card will automatically add "" points '' and said points will be converted into dollars that are deducted automatically from the principle of your mortgage. The product worked as described. HOWEVER : In less than 6 months, Wells Fargo sold my mortgage, rendering the card useless to me. 

Then, without consulting me or without gaining my permission - they simply changed the type of credit card I had. I went to a local branch and was told "" There is nothing you can do about it '' - Basically the company scammed me by letting me take out the card and then as soon as I had a significant balance on it sold my mortgage to avoid me saving hundreds if not thousands of dollars through use of the card over time."
Wells Fargo & Company,My bank account was compromised due to fraud. XXXX XXXX XXXX made me close the account and start a new account. i contact my credit card company Wells fargo Home Furnishings and informed them about it. In the past one month itself they kept running my EFT payments with the old account almost 4 times a month and then charging me a fee for it. I want all the fee waived and stop them from doing this.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I asked wellsfargo to cancel a credit card and pay it in full, they did not process a transaction for paying in full, they only withdrew the minimum. I also asked that they send me paper statements because I have had so much difficulty with the website. They assured me all of my accounts had been transferred to paper. I did not receive any statements in the mail and they continued to charge me interest and fees on an account that should have been closed."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I used my Wells Fargo credit card to purchase XXXX XXXX ticket. On the Tuesday of my flight, XXXX XXXX cancelled the flight without reason. I had to buy an XXXX XXXX XXXX way ticket for {$580.00}. I was very annoyed and XXXX promised to send me XXXX miles to make up for the inconvenience. But they never did. So i filed a dispute through my credit card company. 6 weeks later, Wells Fargo initially told me XXXX acknowledged their wrong and that they ( XXXX ) had promised to issue me air miles. They promised to check my account in 2 weeks and if XXXX did not keep to their word, they ( Wells Fargo ) would issue a refund. called a month later and was told the case was closed but Wells Fargo would happily open the case again.2 weeks later, Wells Fargo sent me a letter stating that XXXX said flight was never cancelled. Case closed. This is the most unbelievable act of laziness, inconsistence and lack of investigation I 've ever witnessed."
Wells Fargo & Company,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a XXXX Account. In XXXX XXXX, the balance left on this XXXX Account was included in a bankruptcy. I checked my credit today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and found that XXXX or its credit reporting agency had adjusted the open date of the account from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX so that the negative information could stay on my credit history. This information should have come off when the bankruptcy came off of my credit report in XXXX XXXX. 

The credit reporting agency is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX"

Well let me rectify this again for you, and I Will not discuss other disputes again, I am simply going go over this XXXX ATM at roughly XXXX at a convenient store located across from XXXX, next to XXXX XXXX Here is what is wrong with WELLS FARGO "" theory '' When I attempted to take the money out of ATM, nothing came out and I called WELLS FARGO right away reading off the transaction number that came out. On my way out of the store, there was only woman working behind the counter. I did not even approach her and she could not even see me where the ATM is my back was to her, she DID N'T EVEN KNOW THAT I DID NOT GET THE XXXX XXXX DOLLARS, AND IT 'S NOT AS IF SHE WAS STARING AT ME THROUGH MY BACK WATCHING EVERY CUSTOMER GOES TO THE ATM. AND SHE WAS NOT THE MANAGER, SHE WAS AN EMPLOYEE, YOU STATED A MANAGER SAW ME. IF HE WAS THERE, HOW COULD HE HAVE SEEN ME THROUGH THE COFFEE DISPLAY AND MY BACK TOWARD THE COUNTER ALMOST XXXX feet away. AS WELL IF I DID NOT MENTION IT TO ANYONE AT THE COUNTER, THEN WHEN WELLS FARGO CALLED TO TALK TO THE MANAGER, HOW WOULD HE EVEN OF KNOWN WHO I WAS. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. PUll THE TAPE FROM THAT NIGHT, THEY MUST HAVE ONE, AS IT 's BY A BUSY AREA. BUT HERE IS WHERE IT IS ALSO OBVIOUS, MY PHONE RECORDS SHOW THAT I CALLED WELLS FARGO TWO TIMES RIGHT AFTER THE TRANSACTION TO REPORT IT, BUT HERE IS WHERE YOUR AGAIN, IS JUST MORE PROOF, AT THE TIME I TRIED TO TAKE OUT THE {$200.00}, the only amount of money I Was allowed to withdraw from my credit card was {$200.00} a day. So then why when after I reported the XXXX never came out of the machine, did I few minutes later go to the motel next door atm and withdraw XXXX from there. If I did get the first XXXX logically I would not try another ATM cause it would be pointless, I only had a XXXX maximum withdrawal. You allowed a merchantt to commit a crime. And I given you guys enough chances to fix this and other disputes you already gave me then took back. And, at this time, nor anytime in future will this matter be resolved until WELLS FARGO pays me back, and I will be charging late fees."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a credit card through Wells Fargo for XXXX Flooring. I made a promotional purchase for slightly over {$3000.00} with a 12 month no interest promotion. In XXXX 2016, I owed {$130.00} for that promotional purpose. That promotional balance is due by XXXX XXXX, 2016. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I made a separate {$2000.00} promotional purchase under a 12 month no interest promotion.. I made a {$130.00} payment on XXXX XXXX, 2016 which would have paid the initial promotional balance in full. Wells Fargo has applied over {$120.00} of that payment to the later {$2000.00} promotional purchase and is now demanding an additional {$120.00} payment by XXXX XXXX, 2016 to avoid being charged interest for the entire initial promotional balance. Is there any legal recourse against this flawed allocation of payment to a later promotional balance which will force me to make an additional {$120.00} payment above my {$130.00} payment?"
Wells Fargo & Company,"When I applied for the XXXX XXXX American Express Card, I was told there was an introductory APR of 0 %. This was in the Terms and Conditions. Also in the T & C is a statement that no interest will be charged if the balance is paid in full by the due date. What is the point of a 0 % APR if interest will be charged regardless? When I called the bank, from whom I received the card, they told me that that was just the way the card works, no further explanation. I made purchases with the above mentioned card, and in my second statement was billed for nearly {$20.00}."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have had a credit card account with Wells Fargo for almost XXXX years. During this time I Have never been late nor been over my limit. I pay several bills each month on or about the XXXX. I keep a log of the date I pay the bills that are not payed via auto payment. The Wells Fargo Visa card is logged with a payment of {$30.00} made on the due date of XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo indicates that I did not make this payment. This again would be the first payment I have missed in XXXX years of doing business with Wells Fargo on this card. When I logged into my account to make my payment in XXXX, the statement reflected the missed payment and a late charge. I contacted Wells Fargo about the missed payment and they reversed the late fee. I then made a double payment on the XXXX of XXXX to cover the payment for XXXX and XXXX. When I tried to log into my account in XXXX, I no longer had on-line access to my account. I tried to contact Wells Fargo by phone and was told that I owed an additional late fee for XXXX. I tried to get them to transfer me to the on-line help desk to allow me access to my account so I could see what they were charging me for, and they would not without making a payment. I again made a double payment, but was hung up on before obtaining access to my account. There have been no new charges to this card since XXXX of 2015. My minimum payment has gone from {$27.00} a month to {$180.00} for the month of XXXX. I have made monthly payments well over the minimum payment every month since the supposed missed payment in XXXX. I have called several times and continue to get the run around from Wells Fargo. I was finally able to get them to transfer me to an on-line support representative who assisted me in accessing my on-line account. The minimum payment due is associated with fees that should not have been charged. If you look at my credit report and history you will see that this is the only financial institution that I have any type of problem with. On the contrary, I handle my monies very responsibly. This account in itself was in perfect order until the so called missed payment in XXXX. I see this as a total abuse on Wells Fargo 's part. Do I have any recourse? Please Help!"
Wells Fargo & Company,"On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I submitted a notarized affidavit of fraudulent transaction to Wells Fargo for charges that I never made or authorized. Wells Fargo allege they did an investigation and said no fraud occurred despite XXXX letters from myself stating such and the fact that the bank the money they said the money was forward to I do not have an account. I have forward a police report, notarized affidavit through the FTC, and they refuse to adhere to the Consumer Protection Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act under the FTC. In XXXX certified letters and XXXX phone conversation to Wells Fargo Unit I have requested the full account information so that I may complete the police report to seek charges against the suspect ( s ). To date all correspondents state I can have all information included in their investigation upon request ; however, to date Wells Fargo has refused to provided me any the information which they say but has to date refuse to provide and in fact in phone conversation has stated they can not give me that information of my account activity. To date Wells Fargo has never initiated a call or any communication with with me for any details or facts of the theft. All actions, reports and follow-up have been by me trying to get the matter resolved and the information of the suspect to seek criminal charges. In XXXX of my calls the Wells Fargo Fraud to follow up on if their was any investigation being done, the representative did ask me if I had an account with Bank XXXX XXXX ending with XXXX. I told them I nor any authorize user have a checking or saving accounts with Bank XXXX XXXX. To be sure no account was fraudulent opened or existed in my name, I contacted Bank XXXX XXXX and forward the information to Wells Fargo Fraud Unit of the Bank XXXX XXXX Fraud representative I spoke to that there are no accounts in my name and that they can not identify the owner of the account without the full account number. Wells Fargo either is trying to make me pay for their mistake or they are trying to aid the suspect in their fraud efforts but in doing so they are in violation of the consumer protection act and Fair Credit Reposting Act by keeping the fraudulent charges on my credit and not correcting the fraudulent charge after being notified within the stated time frame."
Wells Fargo & Company,Wells Fargo closed my credit card with out notification. They stated that they closed the card because it was not used for 6 months. This action taken by Wells Fargo has had a negative impact to my credit rating.
Wells Fargo & Company,I have a jewelry account that is held through Wells Fargo. I have XXXX promotional balances that are currently active. XXXX is equal payments with a fixed interest rate of 9.9 % and XXXX are interest free if paid within so many months ( interest rate if not paid is 28.24 % ). I paid additional payments that I wanted to apply to the no interest balances so that they would be paid off within the promotional period. Wells Fargo applied the additional payment to the balance with the lower fixed interest rate. I called them and they refused to re-allocate the payment. This will make it impossible to pay the balances that expire within the next 10 months unless I pay XXXX payments of over {$700.00} the last 2 months prior to the promotion expiration.
Wells Fargo & Company,I received several calls over the course of 3 days from the same phone #. The caller never left a message and called excessively each day until I finally answered on the third day. He said he was calling from Wells Fargo about my unpaid balance of {$30.00}. I asked him why I never received a statement he said he could not control the Post Office. So when I saw he was being sarcastic I told him I would check my account online and ended the call. My problem is this is the first time I remember getting a call from Wells Fargo about my payment being past due. I have had this account for more than 3years and have kept up with the payments. I do n't understand the need for calling me at least three times daily about a balance of {$30.00}. I do know a thing or two about collections. He should have left a message the first or second time so I would know what the call was about. Then he would not have had to call me a third time. I would have just answered. But still calling a customer three or more times in a day is harassment.

Wells Fargo & Company,"On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received a letter from Wells Fargo Card Services informing me that my credit card account had been closed. ( I am attaching the letter to this complaint ). The reason provided by Wells Fargo was that there have been unusual activity on my account that that because Wells Fargo had been unable to reach me they had closed the account. Please note that I have not been contacted by telephone, mail, email or in any other matter by Wells Fargo concerning any aspect of the account. 
On the same day that I received this letter, I contacted Wells Fargo Customer Service. The customer service representative told me that she did not know why the account had been cancelled. She then kept me on hold for 6 minutes while she supposedly checked with the Fraud Unit. She came back to tell me the Fraud Unit had not cancelled the account, but that the account was cancelled by the Collections Department. I inquired why my account was in collections because it had not been past due and I had received no notifications ever from Wells Fargo that the account was past due. I then asked to speak to a manager. After another 7 minutes on hold a manager came on to inform me that he would transfer me to Collections. After another 6 minutes on hold he came back to state that I would need to send a photo ID to collections in order for them to discuss the matter with me. I found this to be completely unacceptable. At this point, I do n't much care if all of my accounts at Wells Fargo are closed because I am utterly dismayed by the incompetence of everyone at Wells Fargo. However I want to know why my account was closed and ensure that there has been no adverse actions initiated by Wells Fargo against me or my account. I also want to ensure that others do not have to deal with the gross incompetence that I have endured in trying to resolve a matter related to my account. I am hoping that the CFPB can help Many Thanks"
Wells Fargo & Company,"On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo dated XXXX XXXX stating they had found unusual activity in my account and that my account would be closed if the activity continued beyond receipt of the letter. I immediately discontinued use of the account, but on XXXX XXXX, found my account was closed and pending credit card rewards confiscated anyway. I made several calls to Wells Fargo to try to reopen the account to no avail. 
On XXXX XXXX, I received a letter, dated XXXX XXXX, congratulating me for being a top tier customer and providing enhanced rewards. According to the letter, under this reward structure, "" XXXX points has a {$520.00} value ''. Wells Fargo confiscated XXXX points. Based on Wells Fargo 's valuation, these points have a value of {$26000.00}."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo Financial has been reporting a negative "" LATE '' payment to all of the credit reporting agencies since XXXX of XXXX. During the month of XXXX XXXX I did n't receive that month 's bill ( not by email or US Mail ) somehow they forgot to send it to me that particular month in question. I just so happened to review an online statement that showed a Late Fee assessed to my account ( which was specialized account connected to a purchase from a company named XXXX XXXX and financed via Wells Fargo [ opened XXXX XXXX, XXXX ] in the form of a credit card account ) ; so I immediately contacted Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX and filed my initial complaint in efforts of reversing any possible damage to my credit and fee assessment. Okay, the fee was credited back to me and I was told that nothing was or will be reported to the major credit reporting companies ( not to worry ). Well the only truth to that statement, was that I was reimbursed the fee that was assessed ; but they to this day continue to report that I was 30 - 59 days late to all the credit reporting agencies. I even disputed this with Wells Fargo on a formal level and they still have n't changed anything. My argument is that I was given back any alleged late fees and told this would n't be reported ( they lied to me plain as day ). I frequent the app ' XXXX and to this day my FICO score is a little above XXXX - NEVER EVER BEEN LATE in paying back any of my creditors and was excused by Wells Fargo, yet they still plague me with a negative blemish that haunts me to this present day and that 's noted on my reports as the only damaging entry ( absent of that, I 'd have a PERFECT credit rating ) .... 

*This in my second time placing this complaint, I just completed this entire form and was at review - after reviewing it 's content, approved it then hit "" SUBMIT '' I got an system error message telling me to press the BACK button which erased my entire complaint content - I 'M XXXX ..."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I paid off my Wells Fargo credit card in XXXX, 2016. I had a balance of {$0.00} on my next statement. Then, on XXXX/XXXX/16 I received a new alert that my payment had been reversed and I owed {$490.00}, which is my current balance. 

Wells Fargo can not give me a reason for this reversal. I do not currently have the money to make this payment and refuse to pay it again without a good reason why."
Wells Fargo & Company,"What happened and is continuing to happen is that Wells Fargo issues secured credit cards for those with no credit or those hoping to repair their credit. With this offer is often an explicit promise of "" graduating '' or getting the {$300.00} minimum deposit returned and being upgraded to an unsecured credit card, often in "" one year '' or less. Well it has been a year and a half and every time I call Wells Fargo to inquire about my graduation, I keep getting the run around, which initially meant XXXX of 2016, when I called them back in XXXX. I feel that this product and its many selling point are misleading and deceptive. The bank seems keen on earning interest on ALL those minimum required deposits but less willing to be transparent about when and how the graduation will take place."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I received a letter on XXXX XXXX that was dated from XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo. It stated, "" we reviewed and found an unusual volume of purchases and/or payments made using this card. '' And it continued to say, "" if it continues beyond the receipt of this notice we will close your account and your rewards balance will be forfeited. '' I completely stopped using the card altogether. At this point, I had {$3500.00} in rewards that were earned during this billing cycle and I did not want to risk losing them so I did not use the card again. My credit card balance was more than {$24000.00} at this time with a total limit of {$25000.00}. I was basically maxed out and absolutely needed to make a payment so I did not risk adverse action from other creditors if I allowed the total balance of {$24000.00} to report on my credit reports. So I made a payment to get the balance down and this payment was the only activity on the card after receiving the letter. 

Wells Fargo closed my account anyway and I received a letter dated XXXX that stated, "" per the warning notice we sent, we closed your account on XXXX. You can no longer make transactions with this account and your rewards balance has been forfeited '' Wells Fargo clawed back rewards that I earned legitimately after sending out a warning letter, to which I obeyed, and cited the warning letter as the reasoning behind the closure. 

I have read some of Wells Fargo 's responses to other complaints and Wells Fargo does not need to inform me that my CURRENT rewards balance is {$0.00}. I know that it is {$0.00} as of today. It was {$3500.00} before my account was closed and Wells Fargo forfeited them."
Wells Fargo & Company,Wells Fargo Bank cancelled my credit card due to a transaction the rental car company placed 3 weeks after my business was done with them.
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo is still reporting my account as late for 90 days even though it 's paid. Upon paying this debt, they told me they would delete this account from my credit profile. This is for account beginning with XXXX. I did not open this account, and I paid it just to have it removed from my profile rather than deal with the hassle. Now it is more hassle than I expected. They performed a "" bait and switch '' to get my money then did n't hold up their end of the bargain. This is illegal, and it 's over a small amount of money. This need to be removed from my credit profile."
Wells Fargo & Company,"This situation is not over until I get paid, I love how WELLS FARGO sends fraud proof to consumerfinance.gov thinking they can take my rights away, I HAVE PROOF OF THEIR illegal activity and the fact they would not call me to talk about this they sent some shady mail to me that was full of worthless repent and even proved I am right, there are many many issues other ones I can right here as I have not enough room. I was hoping WELLS FARGO would have come its sense and realize that it 's calling ME, the card holder, the consumer and customer a liar. But in essence, knowing full well all the issue we had with identity theft and precautions we need to now take, and knowing full well WELLS FARGO made well over {$350.00} just in 3 months of over 12 months I had the card. I did not complain about the {$10.00} atm charge you charged me every time I used the card or your high interest rates. And I was never late once with my bill. Not to mention I can show with phone records and emails how many times I had to call in to WELLS FARGO to handle simple small issues over and over and over again. I can promise you as well over two hours a week was spent dealing with issues that I was told once I signed the forms would be handled. And they never did, they always came back. As well I also There were several disputes on the card that were active when WELLS FARGO closed the card down. And oddly the card just so happened to equal {$1000.00} which was my deposit. 

I have lost four times over with every company, not only not caring of my extreme identity theft issues, but taking advantage of our situation when we paid our bills and we stayed in contact with each company every issues doing whatever company policies were, but in the end, those things never mattered either. 

So, I let all those issues go, all those many many many issues. And I told you guys I was willing work with you, but you, again, WELLS FARGO has found a way to call the consumer who took the time to call right away when there was an issue on the card, a liar. So, I your customer, lied to you about the {$200.00} ATM dispute in XXXX. Cause what you told me was the MERCHANT saw me take the money of the machine. Well let me rectify this again for you, and I Will not discuss other disputes again, I am simply going go over this XXXX ATM at roughly XXXX at a convenient store located across from XXXX, next to XXXX XXXX -"
Wells Fargo & Company,"Short version : Due to series of bank errors, a credit card account was closed due to late payment. The late payment and account closure were reported to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX. Due to this, I was denied a credit card by the credit union through which I applied. I 'm in the process of closing my accounts with Wells Fargo Bank ( WFB ) and moving them to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Details : My only credit card issued through Wells Fargo was stolen in XX/XX/XXXX so I was issued a replacement credit card with new account number. For automatic payment, the credit card department connected my card to a closed checking account, not my error. Ergo, the payment was denied and I was charged {$33.00} for the denied payment and then a {$15.00} late fee. The closed bank account was not attached to my savings account so that the payment was not taken from there, again, a bank error. Further, I was unaware of any of this because I never received a paper bill, my credit card account was not listed on the account summary page I frequently signed on to check on line and my credit card account did not reflect the address change I made to my account soon after the new credit card was issued. Address changes on my other accounts with the same bank were made immediately. I have done business with WFB for years and have never had any problems of this sort. It may be of interest to note that in XXXX 2016, I was given a loan through WFB for a car I bought. That loan has been paid in full."

Wells Fargo again has committed fraud and embezzlement, they keep sending consumerfinance.gov and me these illegal documents and they do not address my issues, there for I am building a case against them and will put them back up until they pay up, I will not tolerate consumer terrorists.

Wells Fargo & Company,"After returning an Item costing {$80.00}, in XXXX 2016, which was not credited to my account until I called after having been charged a {$24.00} late fee for 2 months, they then told me they never recieve my online payment. Never notified me and continued to accrue late fees until XXXX. I spoke to the customer service cleared up the bill and all the late fees with my debit card and closed the account. They now bill me again for "" late chages '' and when I called them they said they had the wrong Account number and never posted this new late fee to my checking account.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells fargo Visa card and checking account - demanded over numerous years that all overdraft protection be removed and was assured it was not. each time I overdrafted it, it took from my credit card, allowing me to continue using my debit with no clue I had a XXXX balance. what should have been a one time fee and my card decline on the next purchase turned into multiple "" lower fees meant to save me money and help me continue shopping ''. these added up to far more than the one time fee. sure enough, happened again. only this time, the overdraft fee turned into a fee hitting me from the checking account AND credit card side multiple times, then hitting me with cash advance fees. A soda , drive thru and gum purchased totalled all of XXXX bucks, which has now cost me XXXX and climbing as the cash advance fees rack up. apparently, they stick the cash advance debt behind your running balance, preventing you from ever freeing yourself. three separate times now I have called and been assured it was removed."
Wells Fargo & Company,"While visiting the Wells Fargo Bank, a banker offered me a credit card, according to what he read from the bank site, I was eligible for a card with an APR of 8 %, with 0 % rate for 15 months, I agreed on the condition that my rate would be 8 %. When I received the card, it had a rate of 21.4 % after the promotional period. I contacted customer service by phone, when I told the representative about it, she urged me to go into Wells and see the banker, have him call in and it would be honored ; however, I went in, the banker called in, but Wells was not willing to honor the rate. I feel that it was discrimination, as XXXX are often given higher rates, despite their credit scores."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Hello, I am retired, and I recently had some trouble with my credit card. My husband and I are getting older, we are both XXXX. We recently hired someone to go over our finances, because at our age it is very hard for us to keep track of everything. Anyway our financial advisor went over our books and he asked us about some transactions that stood out and most of them we knew what they were, but one company we did not know. Our financial advisor researched the company and said that he was very skeptical of the company. When he called them they had no records for us and could n't tell us what exact business they were in. At that point we knew something was amiss. Since the transaction was done on my Wells Fargo Visa, I thought we were protected because they have a {$0.00} fraud liability thing in their contract. So we called them to report the transaction as fraud on XXXX/XXXX/2016. They told me that it should take about 7-10 business days. We got a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/2016, stating that the charges were valid and authorized, however I never authorized these charges and I told them that over the phone. They sent me another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which said that because I continued to pay my bill that I authorized the transactions. I hate to say this but I am XXXX years old, and I always pay my bill. That is part of the reason we hired someone to do our books, because truth be told we are just not able to do it very well anymore. Me paying my bill has nothing to do with me authorizing the charges, I have never even heard of this company. I also filed for a reconsideration with Wells Fargo and stated that I had never heard of this company and that I always pay my bill. They sent me a denial letter for reconsideration dated XXXX XXXX."
Wells Fargo & Company,"We use our Wells Fargo Credit Card monthly and pay off monthly. In XXXX I paid half of the full amount that would be due XXXX XXXX and intended to pay the rest before the XXXX XXXX due date so as not to incur interest charges. My husband did n't know I only paid half and continued using the card for his business purchases. On XXXX his business purchase put us over the credit limit by {$72.00} which they told me is a courtesy. I understand, that 's great so as not to cause embarrassment, etc. But the company allowed NINE more days and XXXX more transactions to occur, putting the account at {$1200.00} over the limit!!! We receive NO PHONE CALL, NO LETTER, NO NOTICE, NO EMAIL, NOTHING and they closed the acct on XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I paid the other half of the remaining balance for the 30 day charging window, bringing our balance to zero for that payment period. The remaining balance will be due XXXX/XXXX/16 and is under the credit limit. Under the terms and agreements for this card, no where does it state that they will close the account if it goes over the limit. Wells Fargo DID NOT notify us as they stated they did in a letter they mailed out on XXXX/XXXX/16, the same day they closed our account. We received the letter on XXXX/XXXX/16. How can a credit card company allow transactions to occur when the card goes over the limit!? Every card we have ever had, does not allow you to go over repeatedly once a transaction puts you over the limit. It declines further transactions. Wells Fargo Bank NA does not do business well, and they do not return phone calls. I have left XXXX messages on XXXX of the main managers voicemail who would handle this. No one calls me back. I will never EVER do business with Wells Fargo again. How ironic that we have never had any problems like this until after our Wells Fargo Home Mortgage loan was paid in full and all we had left with their company was this credit card. They are deceitful and do not communicate well with their account holders. XXXX XXXX XXXX BANK IS THE BEST."

I returned the car to the agency after XXXX days of use and they stamped my receipt as XXXX days of use. Wells Fargo bank listened to the merchant and betrayed me, by paying the merchant all XXXX days, although I only used the car XXXX days. They listened to the merchant unjustly and sided with them. My life and my family 's life was placed in danger with this irresponsible merchant and now Wells Fargo 's lack of training of its Customer Service reps, did not look at the facts and lazily did not take into consideration the pictures, letters and docs that I sent them."
Wells Fargo & Company,"With all the offers of 0 % for a limited time, not all banks put the expiration date of the offer on their statements. This has already cost me {$100.00} in interest charges on one credit card because I was n't aware that the offer was expiring and was given the wrong month of expiration when I called. There have got to be many more people who are losing money to banks this way. The consumer should be warned when the offer is expiring to give them a chance to pay the balance in full."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I opened a card with Wells Fargo through a retail purchase at a jeweler. The only reason that I choose the financing option was due to it being a surprise and not wanting to pull the money from our savings account. Since the finance charges are paid at the origination of the loan it makes no financial sense to pay the card off now at this point. As with all of our bills this was set up on auto-payment shortly after the account was opened. At that time I had made an error in the checking account information causing the payment to not process on the next payment cycle. This first occurrence was my mistake and it was promptly corrected on our end by making the payment as soon as the issue was realized. From that point I went back online and canceled the previous auto payment with the incorrect information and set up the new one. The next month to my surprise the payment did not process yet again but this time everything was set up correctly for the auto payment. After calling and speaking with a representative they argued that the auto payment was cancelled but not set back up. I could clearly see on my online account that it was set up after the initial incorrect auto payment was cancelled. After I directed the representative to where i was reading the message from Wells Fargo about the auto payment we saw that it stated that it could take 2-3 months for the auto pay to go into effect! I explained to the representative that I felt this was completely unacceptable. How was I to know if it processed or not until after my payment was already late I asked. Her response was that she was n't sure and I would just have to monitor my account to see if it came out or not. When it came time for my next payment to process it failed to do so again. I spoke with the representative who claims to see no auto payment information on my account. After I logged into my online system I was astonished to see that the previous messages from Wells Fargo on my account about the auto payment are no longer there! It is as if they had been deleted because even the welcome messages etc. are gone as well. If the call I had with the first representative was reviewed it will be clear that what I claiming is in fact truthful. 
We are in the process of building a home so our credit is very critical at this point. We strive very hard to ensure nothing is ever late with any payment we make and always pay much more than the minimum. Wells Fargo has been nothing but a hassle since the very first payment and all we are trying to do is ensure they receive the money we owe them. Every month it is a constant issue taking time out of our busy schedules to ensure this gets corrected. The frustration and XXXX we deal with on a monthly basis is not acceptable and I feel Wells Fargo should be held responsible to make this correct. We are very deliberate about every account we choose to open and what banks deal with our financial matters. We feel at this point that Wells Fargo is not meeting our expectations when our time is extremely valuable to us."

Wells Fargo & Company,"XX/XX/2016 I was the victim of credit card fraud. I was put into contact with a computer service company by XXXX after I could not access my email account. My password stopped working and my recovery email was long since deleted. The company ( who I did not get a name for ) offered to get me into my XXXX account and delete it, per my request, for {$99.00}. I paid them and gave them remote access of my computer. I watched them do some programing on my computer that I did not really understand, when they finished they claimed that my account was deleted and in a couple of days it would be gone forever. Two days later I get a call from the company and the man said that his name was XXXX XXXX which, based on his XXXX accent, was clearly not his real name. He said that they had used software on my computer that was against company regulation and they had to refund me the {$99.00}. I agreed and gave them remote access to my computer again. The man explained that they would wire the money into my account directly and all I had to do is log on to my Wells Fargo bank account. I agreed and logged on. He then explained that he had to darken my screen while he completed the transfer so that I would not see his bank 's routing numbers. I complied and when the screen came back up it showed that my account had an additional {$3100.00} in it. At this point the man put on a show, he claimed that he had made an awful mistake over refunding me and that if he did not fix it he would lose his job. I was a little suspicious but I looked at the balance of my other XXXX accounts ( savings, and credit card ) and they were correct. I felt bad for him and figured that I would not be able to keep the money anyway so I agreed to help him out. He asked be to wire {$2900.00} of the money to his associate, a man named XXXX XXXX in XXXX. He told me that the cost of the wire was only {$60.00} and I could keep the additional {$40.00} for my trouble. After work I went and wired the money. Throughout the process "" XXXX XXXX '' called me continuously expressing his gratitude and fear of losing his job. When the money gram was done he thanked me excessively and offered to give me free computer service. The next day I received a call from a different man who informed me that the money did not go through because it was my first time wiring money and the amount was suspiciously large. He transferred me to XXXX and XXXX again had me give him access to my Wells Fargo account and he "" wired '' the money back into my account. When I saw the money was in my account I again went and wired the {$2900.00}. The next day I got another call from "" XXXX '' claiming that this wire also did not go through. At this point I realized that something must be really wrong. Over the past two days I continuously checked the balance of all XXXX of my accounts and they all had the appropriate amounts ( which is why I agreed to send the money ). This time though, when I checked my account, my credit card had about {$7000.00} in charges that I did not make and had not seen. I looked at my history and figured out that they had fraudulently forwarded money from my credit card to my checking account via cash advances. The money they "" wired '' me was my own money. I did not notice the transactions because they took two days to post. Immediately I called Wells Fargo and explained the entire scam. I tried to call money gram and cancel the wire but it was too late. After filing my claim with Wells Fargo I had to get a new credit card, new checking account, and change all of my online information. I was instructed to wait 8-10 business days. I did not hear from them for two weeks so I called. They told me that I would not be refunded because I wired the money. I explained that the fraud was on my credit card and therefore XXXX % covered by the federal government. He claimed he could do nothing."
Wells Fargo & Company,"My Wells Fargo credit card was a promotional interest rate card ( deferred interest ) where no interest would be incurred if the balance was paid in full within 12 months. I missed the expiration date of the promotion period on the statement as it was on the second page of the statement. I understand from a question and answer segment on your website "" Your credit card company must tell you the date by which you must pay off your balance to avoid being charged deferred interest. That information must appear on the front page of your bill. '' I was charged almost {$600.00} of interest at a 28 % annual rate."
Wells Fargo & Company,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2016 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX To whom it may concern, The morning of XXXX XXXX, 2016 I had walked into the Wells Fargo located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX for an appointment with a Personal Banker by the name of XXXX XXXX. The intention of the meeting was to open up a business checking account and submit an application for a Home Equity Line of Credit. This intention was discussed in advance via e-mails and phone calls. 
During the meeting, I had let XXXX know of my current job position as a Credit Risk Analyst at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had also disclosed that I used to work for Wells Fargo in several positions including that of Personal Banker. I notified XXXX of my current financial needs and answered her questions for my Home Equity Line of Credit to the best of my knowledge. I brought in all requested paperwork for proof of my financial situation needed in underwriting ( tax returns, paystubs, bank statements, etc. ) Further into the meeting, I was offered a business credit card in which I stated I had no need for. I was pressured by XXXX to open it as she continued to sell me reason after reason on why I would need that card. I told her that I already have several business credit cards and have absolutely no need for another card. She stated that Wells Fargo already ran my credit so I did n't have to worry about another inquiry. I replied that an inquiry is not my concern, it was having a new account that I had no use for and that my current credit exposure is already too high and affecting my credit score. I also stated that I would be buying a new car by the end of the year and would n't want to chance any credit score deterioration to affect my rate. My answer was a firm "" NO ''. 
Fast-forward to Saturday, XXXX XXXX, 2016. I go to check my mail and to my surprise I find a business credit card from Wells Fargo with a credit line of {$10000.00}. The exact card I remember saying no to! I promptly call the banker at XXXX that day to complain. She returns my call at XXXX, but it goes to voicemail as I had left my phone in the car while at the gym. Her voicemail states she did not open the card, and if she did, it was by slip of the hand. I called her back at around XXXX that same day and reminded her that I used to work her position and I know what she was telling me was simply not true. I signed documents allowing only for new business accounts ( checking and savings ) and for the Home Equity Line of Credit. The signature was in an electronic box which is customary for Wells Fargo Banking practices. XXXX explained to me what each signature was for and I took her at her word. I have then checked the copies of documents provided by XXXX that was handed over to me in a Wells Fargo folder at the conclusion of our meeting. There were no documents pertaining to the Credit Card to be found. I have no idea how they opened up a business credit card without my signature. Whether it was forged or if they used XXXX of my other applications to apply for the card. 
I will be pursuing removal of this new account on all credit bureaus it has been reported to. I will be calling the Branch Manager on XXXX XXXX, 2016 ( one day after this complaint submission to demand an explanation of his/her banker 's actions ). Please assist me in rectifying this matter. 
Thank you, XXXX XXXX"
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo special interest free credit cards. XXXX problems with paying the card. 
1. When doing a monthly payment, one can not put in cents. This is a problem due to not being able to take the payment and dividing it by XXXX. One needs to calculate the first payment to include the cents of future payments because there web site can not handle cents on monthly payments. 

2. This is the most egregious. When setting up a monthly payment one can not set an end date. Thus, a year from setting this up, one needs to remember to cancel the monthly payment, else they will continue to take withdrawals. You then need to request that they refund your overpayment. 

3. Their web site is unaware of payments and will not allow monthly payments until current payments are processed. It took three days for me. This was annoying because I needed to continue coming back to the site so I could do monthly payment. 

4. Although the contact people were pleasant, they were hampered by the web site being poorly set up with restrictions that there was no solution to."

Wells Fargo & Company,"i went to my bank to inquire about my current credit card. A personal visa with one year no interest. 
I mentioned that I used the card for business and was told by the banker XXXX that if i apply for a business visa i could transfer my remaining balance from personal card to the new business card interest free for another 12 months. I reluctantly agreed because I have very little experience with credit cards but it would be nice to separate business and personal fiances. 
I was approved for XXXX dollar limit card that i did not use or activate till about a month ago i went to another local bank branch to inquire about the transfer and was told there would be a XXXX % fee based on the amount i was transferring. with still a month left on the interest free personal card i told the banker i would like to see if i could pay the balance down before i transferred accounts. He agreed and i left. 
yesterday being the last day of the month, and interest free on the personal card was ending. I entered a Wells Fargo branch in XXXX Co. to transfer accounts and was told it could only happen if the personal account was from another bank. To say the least i was confused. so i called the service number on the back of the card. after explaining the same up to this point. I was told that transferring balances was impossible unless i was willing to pay XXXX % fee and 24 % interest on remaining balance. A different story from each banker! 
I was told the initial banker ( XXXX ) sold me the wrong product and she should have sold me a line instead of a card, what ever that meant, and that she would set that up if i like but it would take a while and she did not sound to confident in what she was even saying. So i asked to speak with a supervisor. when the supervisor got on the phone he ran around the subject for a few minutes after hearing my story. He offered some condolences asked what he could do for me and then the phone was mysteriously disconnected..surprising..or not.. 
so an hour later and with a nice manner and com attitude i phoned the Wells Fargo visa number back and requested a supervisor directly. i told my hole story again has listed above and was immediately assured i have the right person and the buck stops with her. she apologized for the situation and put me on hold to research. when she got back with me. i was told there is no way to transfer the balance from one account to the other and she was truly sorry. during our discussion i told her that i would not have used the card in such a way if i had not been lied to and that i thought canceling the business account would be a good idea. 
needless to say. 
i would have drastically changed my spending had i known that i was lied to and never would have even applied for this card if not cow-erst in to it. and would have not made curtain purchases knowing that i was n't receiving what i was told. 
the buck stops with me, final solution was to close the business account which she offered up very quickly and without hesitation and that corporate will talk to the banker and thanked me for bring it to there attention. 
so here i sit, a closed account and maybe some one will talk to the initial banker about it. 
i truly feel taken advantage of and fraud ed by Wells Fargo."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I bought a rug in XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2016 using my Wells Fargo Visa card. Before buying, I confirmed with the vendor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that they had a return policy in place for shipments to the US and they agreed. When the carpet was delivered in XX/XX/XXXX, I found there was a disconnect between the size I had been talking to them about and what was delivered. After phone and email exchanges, we came to a mutual decision that I would return the rug to a designated location in XXXX, CA. This I did, via XXXX ( and out of my own pocket ), requiring a delivery signature and insuring the rug during transit. The vendor indicated that once I had returned the rug, I should merely dispute the charge and they would reverse it. I have documentation for all email exchanges ( including descriptions of the return process and address, XXXX confirmations of delivery and signature copies verifying the rug was properly returned ). The vendor ( XXXX ) refused to reverse the charges despite the evidence that the rug was returned to them ( which, given the evidence, makes them thieves guilty of theft by taking ). Wells Fargo let me know that they had contacted the vendor about my contesting the charges and that the issue was going to arbitration (???!!! ). I had given WF ALL of my evidence and they had no questions, making the verbal statements that it was "" just procedure ''. The only other communication I eventually got from WF was a statement saying that XXXX had denied WF 's arbitration and WF subsequently re-charged my account for {$4000.00} ( on XXXX/XXXX/2016 ). I went ballistic and demanded reasoning but got XXXX from WF. After several calls, I managed to get them to reluctantly provide an "" escalation path '' -- which fundamentally did nothing more than go back to their arbitration function and confirm what I already knew. Wells then just threw up their hands and said "" that 's our procedure and we do not do anything else. '' HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE DENIED DUE PROCESS AND STOLEN FROM SIMPLY BECAUSE I WIELD A CERTAIN BANK 'S CREDIT CARD? AND, GIVEN MY EVIDENCE, HOW DID ANY SANE ARBITRATOR COME UP WITH A DECISION WHICH SEES ME BILLED FOR SOMETHING WHICH HAS BEEN RETURNED ( AS CORROBORATED BY A REPUTABLE THIRD PARTY )????? This is beyond anything I have ever experienced. And when I tried to pursue this with XXXX, I was stonewalled by a customer service organization which offered NO other paths to appeal. ( They even originally just sent me back to Wells Fargo -- which would be funny, except it 's not. ) In short, XXXX large banks and a vendor have managed to at least attempt the same kind of blatant thievery which sent outlaws to the gallows in the old West -- XXXX XXXX would be pround of them. The FTC/CFPB have GOT to set this right -- and why do I have to go through all these shenanigans for something which is so patently a case of a vendor gone larcenous ( and XXXX large banks being accomplices in the dirty deed )???"
Wells Fargo & Company,"I had a secure card with Wells Fargo where I had to pay them {$500.00} dollars for a {$500.00} dollar line of credit to establish business credit. I cancelled my account XX/XX/XXXX, gave the address to which the money was to be sent. I never got a check so I make it to a branch and checked to see what happened ( I live in a city with no Wells Fargo ). The check was sent to the wrong address the first time. They tell me there is no way I can get the check in the branch so I give the correct address and have it sent to me again. By XX/XX/XXXX, I still have no check, so I call to check and see what is wrong and they tell me it was sent to the wrong address again ; the same address as the first time. I can understand them making the mistake the first time but the exact same thing happened the second time, and they ( Wells Fargo ) still refuse to give me a check in a branch. I call customer service again and they say the only thing they can do is have another check mailed. Giving that I went through giving the correct address two separate occasions, once on the phone and once in person, and the check is still being sent to the wrong place shows something is wrong internally and I should not have to wait months and months for money I had to give to them the same day to receive service. {$500.00} is a decent amount of money and they are doing nothing from a customer service standpoint to help me get my money. When I call and speak to a customer service supervisor, XXXX XXXX, she tells me the only thing she will do for me is take the correct address ( for the 3rd time ) and have another check issued ( for the 3rd time ) .I am filing this complaint because the system Wells Fargo has for returning money to their customers is obviously flawed and they do not have a customer service department capable of actually helping customers when dealing with large sums of money. This is unacceptable, who knows what can come up in 5-6 months where having that {$500.00} can impact my life ; especially when I had to turn it over on the day I opened account to get service."
Wells Fargo & Company,I was dealing with an HVAC and they told me that they could offer me 0 % financing for 36 months through Wells Fargo. I thought the financing would be an installment loan. I gave my info directly to their office and they applied for the credit on my behalf so I did not see the application until they came to install the HVAC. A couple of weeks after I was told I was approved I received a credit card in the mail and my credit score dropped by over XXXX points because it was processed as a credit card not an installment loan.

Wells Fargo told me that the account would be put on hold and no payments needed to be made until the dispute was settled. Today I received a statement from Wells Fargo stating that {$850.00} in interest was due along with the balance on the jewelry. I called them and they said the dispute was settled. I never received anything stating that the dispute was settled. They said they sent a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I never received it. The interest was charged on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, My name is XXXX XXXX and I had a Wells Fargo VISA Signature Card ending in XXXX. 

I received a letter from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2016 noting that there had been some suspicious charges on my account and that if this particular account activity continued after receiving this letter, Wells Fargo noted they would close my account. 
The charges were valid charges, however, I followed the direction and did Not make Any Additional charges whatsoever After receiving the letter on XX/XX/2016. As I state, I followed the letter 's directions exactly, and did Not make Any Additional charges after being directed. 

Logging into my online account a few days afterwards, I noted that my credit card has now been closed without warning or letter from Wells Fargo. More importantly, the {$1500.00} in Wells Fargo Go Far Rewards have not posted and have been XXXX out. 

This is wrong. I received a letter from the credit card company/bank and I followed the letter 's directions and did n't make any additional charges. Additionally, for them to close my credit card account outright without notifying me first is also wrong I believe. All charges were valid. Lastly, if they so choose to close my account for whatever reason, I should be entitled to the {$1500.00} in rewards points I rightfully earned. 

Wells Fargo runs a promotion and refuses to pay out to their customers? I believe this is wrong and I am expecting to get paid out my {$1500.00} in rewards. I am hoping you can step in on my behalf. 

Wells Fargo is deceptive and wrong. They claimed they sent me a letter, which they did as stated above. They clearly told me what not to do and I followed their directions exactly.

My XXXX score at the time of approval was XXXX, and now is above XXXX, which I though was very good. Wells Fargo indicates that the credit card interest rate is determined upon creditworthiness. I 'm outraged at the deception by Wells Fargo to "" bait and switch '' a customer thinking that a very good XXXX score would receive the lowest interest rate. I assumed the worst interest rate I could have received was 15 %, based on my previously unused Wells Fargo credit card.

Wells Fargo & Company,"XX/XX/2015, I received an offer in the mail for a Wells Fargo credit card with a 0 % interest rate for 15 months. I decided it wise to apply for this card since I wanted to transfer a XXXX credit card balance with a 7 % rate to this account knowing that even with the Transfer Fee I was better off in the long run with the reduced interest rate. As directed from this mailing, I had the option to apply online and did so on XXXX/XXXX/15. On that same date at XXXX I received and email acknowledging that I had been approved for a {$5000.00} balance. Attached with this email was the Terms and Conditions for the card, clearly stating that I was approved for 0 % for 15 months that I had hoped to receive. 
Within a week or so I received a Wells Fargo cash back signature credit card in the mail. Shortly after receiving confirmation that I was approved for the 0 % card, I conducted a balance transfer from an existing XXXX MasterCard to the new Wells Fargo account. 
On or about XXXX/XXXX/15, I received my first statement ( see attachment B ) and noticed there was an interest charge in addition to the expected Transfer Fee of {$140.00}. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I called WF Customer Service number on the bill and spoke to a Wells Fargo rep who told me the card had a 12.15 % interest rate not a 0 % rate as promised. She stated she would look into why I did n't get the 0 % interest rate with the credit department and someone would get back to me. As of XXXX/XXXX/15, no one had contacted me with an explanation, nor did I receive any written explanation, so I again called the same customer service number and spoke with another rep. He looked at the notes and saw that on the same date I made the first call, my appeal was referred to the credit approval department and the decision was made to deny me the 0 % interest rate ... This denial however was never conveyed to me with either a phone call, mail or email. I wish to note that this rep was very helpful, friendly and understanding of my situation and also could not understand why I was told I was approved in writing for a 0 % rate, then later sent a card with a 12.15 % interest rate. He advised that I speak to the Credit Approval Dept. I did that same date and was told by a representative that there was nothing that could be done since, unbeknownst to me, I already have a Wells Fargo credit card account opened ( I have a Platinum overdraft protection XXXX that is scarcely used ). 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, I sent a letter to Wells Fargo Executive Offices, as directed by their Customer Service, to try and attain the 0 % rate as promised or at least a refund of my {$140.00} Transfer Fee. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, I received a letter from Wells Fargo denying my request and referring me to page XXXX of the Terms and Conditions that essentially states existing customers are not eligible for this offer. These Terms were attached with the same email that approved me for the offer ... 
At this point I am now stuck with a 12 % interest rate credit card that cost me {$140.00} to obtain, to help pay off a balance on a credit card with a 7 % interest rate ... I 'm sure I do n't have to explain what little sense that makes. Here is my frustration, as stated, I was already approved in writing for the 0 % rate and had no reason to believe I was n't going to receive it as per the XXXX/XXXX/15 email and attachments. Even if I had known that such a rule applies that you ca n't have another WF card to get that rate, that rule was never disclosed in any forms or documents I received when I applied for the 0 % card, otherwise I certainly never would have applied for it. Furthermore, I never received any notice telling me I did n't qualify for the 0 % visa and I never asked for a 12.1 % Cash Back Visa and therefore should not have been sent one. Also what I find disturbing is that after the XXXX XXXX, 2015 call, I never received any word from Wells Fargo that I was denied the account or an"
Wells Fargo & Company,I opened a business checking/savings account in 2011 with Wells Fargo and they were using a credit card for advances without telling me. I could n't even see the card or the card account information on line. After a couple years I went in and told them they had charged me {$160.00} for {$150.00} in advances and I told them it was n't fair and asked to get the {$160.00} returned but they said they would n't so at that point I closed my account and moved to another bank.
Wells Fargo & Company,"Account number : XXXX I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 30 days past due as of XXXX 2012 I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I was charged {$170.00} for renewal of a credit card that I did not need or use. At the time I was cancelling the card I was led to believe that the "" points '' associated with that card would remain intact for me to use for the purposes that were available ( airfare, hotels, etc ). However after the card was cancelled I found that I had forfeited all of my points. The value of these points on a "" cash out '' basis would have been about {$1200.00} which clearly had I known about would not have exchanged for the {$170.00} the bank wanted to charge and which I chose not to pay. My telephone conversation with the customer service agent was recorded. At no time did he indicate to me that I was going to lose my existing balance of earned points under that card account."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Dear XXXX XXXX, I was disappointed to hear that my claim had been rejected and found it personally offensive that 1. It was insinuated that I made a fraudulent claim. 
2. Due diligence was not pursued prior to making such claim against me. The vendor which you refused to reimburse my claim for was not contacted even after I had indicated during my claim process had contacted me and asked if the purchases were made by me specifically because the purchases were not consistent with my purchase history/frequency. 
3. That the debt was returned to my account without prior notification In addition I found the claim process to be insufficient for the following reasons. 
1. Upon initial contact I informed of the charges I was aware of being incorrect and requested that the funds be removed from my debt. After ~1 month I checked the account and determined that the funds had not been returned. I followed up with the claims department and was notified that the internal filing was submitted without any of the previously discussed transactions logged ( i.e. you filed a fraud claim and issued a new credit card but did not log any fraudulent charges ). It would be my expectation that there would be an internal quality control that did not allow for such a mistake. 
2. Upon follow up I requested to be able to email the charges disputed so that I would have documented evidence of the claim. I was informed that this was not possible. This puts your clients at a disadvantage as they have no records with which to dispute issues. 
3. When I requested to speak to a supervisor to report that this error had happened so that it would not be unnoticed I was informed that none were available. I find this to be irresponsible as your staff was unable to address the problem 4. I missed the follow up call from a supervisor and had to call back but needed to leave a message as nobody picked up. I left my contact information and requested a call back but never received one. 
I had to call back a 3rd time to determine what recourse if any I had, and was informed that to dispute the decision I would need to reply by mail and that there would be another 30+ days before a decision would be made. This was insufficient in that the duration further extended the time I had to wait for a resolution, and because I was not informed that under US Banking regulations ( Regulation Z - The Truth in Lending Act ) I was not obligated to pay the disputed amount. This omission is pernicious and misleading. 
Attached you will find emails from the retailer XXXX indicating that they have documented in their systems that the activity I reported has been determined fraudulent in their systems and they are willing to assist with the investigation that Wells Fargo should have taken to resolve this issue in the first place. 
The fraud claims department has not : 1. Employed systems to ensure correct documentation of claims 2. Ensured customers have access to claim documents 3. Reduced the burden of the customers to follow up for information and be notified of change in status 4. Ensured management is available to intervene when greater authority is needed 5. Investigated claims thoroughly before determining customer wrongdoing 6. Provided proper management of the fraud claims department to ensure customers are not unduly burdened to follow up and provide their own investigative proof to be reimbursed for fraudulent activity I am reporting this to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection on the grounds that Wells Fargo is rejecting customer claims without conducting an investigation, and that they are not informing their customers of the rights they have to withhold payment of the disputed amount."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Today 's mail had a letter and other materials for an "" automatic upgrade to the Wells Fargo Visa Signature Card '' from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Senior VP, Credit Card. Unfortunately, the materials consisted of XXXX words in very small fonts explaining the "" benefits '' of the program. The main cover letter contains confusing and sometimes contradictory wording. We called Wells Fargo customer service, XXXX, in an attempt to get some clarity about what was being offered. The representative on the phone was unable to help, seeming unfamiliar with the offer. All I really want to know is what is different about this card being offered compared to the card we have right now. The obfuscation here is mind-boggling!"
Wells Fargo & Company,"WELLS FARGO HAS BEEN CHARGING ME EXCESSIVE CREDIT CARD FEES! I HAD A CREDIT DEFENSE PLATINUM INSURANCE PROTECTION PLAN THAT I PAY MONTHLY FOR THAT IS OFFERED WHEN APPLYING FOR A WELLS FARGO CREDIT CARD. THIS INSURANCE PROTECTION PLAN IS SUPPOSE TO TAKE CARE OF THE CREDIT CARD MINIMUM PAYMENT WHEN I AM HOSPITALIZED. I WAS HOSPITLIZED FOR TWO MONTHS AND FILED A CLAIM THROUGH THE CREDIT DEFENSE PLATINUM INSURANCE BUT BECAUSE WELLS FARGO KEEPS CHARGING MORE AND MORE LATE FEES AND HIGH INTEREST FEES AND ALL OF THE OTHER FEES TO MY CREDIT CARD, THE CREDIT DEFENSE PLATINUM INSURANCE STOPPED PAYING MY MINIMUM PAYMENT BECUAUSE THE FEES MADE MY MINIMUM PAYMENT TOO HIGH. MY WELLS FARGO CREDIT CARD HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR BUT WELLS FARGO STILL KEEPS CHARGING ME LATE FEES, HIGH INTEREST FEES AND OTHER FEES EVERY MONTH FOR MORE THAN A YEAR EVEN THOUGH I CLOSED THE CARD OVER A YEAR AGO. I HAVE ACCUMULATED MORE THAN {$2000.00} IN LATE FEES AND HIGH INTEREST FEES FROM WELLS FARGO EVEN THOUGH I CLOSED THE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MORE THAN A YEAR AGO."
Wells Fargo & Company,"wells fargo allowed my at that time wife to obtain a credit card in my name with a credit limit of {$6000.00} and account ended up with a balance of {$8800.00}. this has had a bad effect on my credit for 10 years helped cause me to lose the ability to change mortgage companies, get refinance and continued to raise my mortgage payment knowing I was stuck in that position with their company."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I took out credit card through Wells Fargo to pay for engagement rings at XXXX XXXX. I never received paper statements, so I would just call and make payments by phone. when I called and made payments representatives of Wells Fargo would tell me my next payment was due in two months. At the time I found this a little odd, but had miss placed my contract so I continued to pay that way. Not receiving any paper statements or late payment notices this went on for about a year. Recently XX/XX/XXXX I called to inquire about my remaining balance, to my surprise it was very close to my original balance when I first bought the rings. I spoke with a supervisor at wells fargo and she said my balance was high because of my late fees and because I had missed their promotional one year no interest so XXXX % had been added on. I explained to her what I had been told on several occasions about paying every other month. Wells Fargo said that is not their policy and they were sorry if someone misinformed me. I requested that she look back through recorded conversations, ( which they warn about every time you call ). It took a week to get back a hold of this supervisor in which she said non of my transactions had been recorded. I took it upon myself to record our conversation as well as another Representative in which the XXXX have contradicting information regarding how my payments work. I thought about contacting cfpb, but then I decided I will just pay my remaining balance but then it jump up once again and I can no longer stomach them doing this to me or anyone else. I just want to pay what I originally owed."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Hi CFPB, Hope all is well. I am writing regarding my Wells Fargo credit card. It is ironic, now after the truth surfaced regarding the questionable Wells Fargo 's moral compass. I have solicited WF 's help multiple times over the course of the past couple of years, stating over and over how I never needed the card, and barely use it anymore. I was paying the minimum, which is an acceptable form of payment, unless of course the exorbitant interest charges and "" late '' fees continue to accrue. Not to mention they reduced my credit limit WITHOUT my consent, seriously damaging my credit. I asked in XXXX of this year what my options were, specifically expressing interest in a balance transfer, or the card they partnered with XXXX. ANTHING to help. While I will give WF credit on their customer service in other areas, I am so disappointed after being a loyal customer for 15+ years there is no option,"
Wells Fargo & Company,"As a background summary, I had an issue with fraudulent charges on my account and getting the matter resolved in a timely, effective manner. Due to my complete disgust with Wells Fargo 's handling of the matter, when it was finally resolved ( on or around XXXX XXXX, 2016 ), I demanded that my account be closed. I was told that it was and I confirmed this by logging onto the institution 's website approximately 3 days later and confirming that the account was removed. 
On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received an e-mail that my Wells Fargo statement was available for viewing. While the balance was {$0.00}, someone re-opened my account. I believe this is related to the checking account scandal. I do not know if this type of activity ( closing and then re-opening accounts ) was included in your investigation. If it was not, it should be. 
I have notified Wells Fargo of ( a ) the re-opening of my account and ( b ) my filing a complaint."
Wells Fargo & Company,A Payment to Wells Fargo for the full balance was made. Wells Fargo continues to hold the payment even now 6 days later. We have made large payments to Wells Fargo in the past and experienced the same issue repeatedly.
Wells Fargo & Company,They changed the type of credit card form a low interest rate to a higher rate card with out my approval. When I asked about it I was told that it was too lat to change it back. The person that changed it was a teller WITHOUT my consent.
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo Bank reduced my available credit line from {$12000.00} to {$2900.00}. I have a perfect pay history on this ( and all ) accounts. This effectively created a maxed out tradeline, which hurts my credit scoring. I was given no advance warning. This was done because the card was on auto-pay and not utilzed. I am in the process of refinancing my home mortgage and a maxed out tradeline hurts my credit eligibility. 

This practice is inconsistent with consumers ' best interest and harmful to tradeline reporting. This should not be done if tradeline is in perfect standing. 

Wells Fargo refused to restore original credit line without pulling my credit again ( as a hard inquiry ). Pulling my credit as a hard inquiry further lowers my credit rating. 

Very harmful practice to consumers. This is a punitive practice targeting consumers who do n't use the Wells Fargo credit card as often as they would like."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Well for starters its not a credit card but it is a debit card. Now that that 's out of the way ; I was gone out of state for 2 months to attend basic military training ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016 to be exact ). There was a withdrawal from my account of {$900.00} on XXXX XXXX 2016 in XXXX, NC. Once I found out I immediately informed my bank about the situation. They put the temporary credit back on there and began the case. Since I was in basic I had no way to communicate with them again until I returned home. On XXXX XXXX 2016 I received a letter stating they denied my claim. They deducted the {$900.00} out of my account this morning and now I 'm in the negatives. I see why they do n't believe me but I do have proof of me being in the other state and not in the state where the money was taken out from. Honestly I feel like the company is horrible for letting something let this happen in the beginning. I have no clue to how they got the money without a problem."
Wells Fargo & Company,"My wife purchased a drink at XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/16. Address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX.

So it appears that 15 minutes after my wife purchased a Smoothie there were XXXX online charges made Fraudulently by a store employee who skimmed my credit card number. I have active Fraud cases open with Wells Fargo for these charges. She returned home immediately after buying the Smoothie so there was no other store purchases by her or myself. I was at work. I do not know who attempted these purchases. I assume they are female because of the XXXX XXXX purchases. So I am unable to provide the information requested above for the name of the person who committed this crime. I want to be refunded {$310.00} back to my card. I myself contacted XXXX to stop the {$1100.00} charge. Wells Fargo is saying they will not refund the {$310.00} because they show it was delivered to my address. It was not. 4 times a year this stuff shows up on 60 minutes where they get tracking info and wait for XXXX to deliver while you are at work.. Anybody can get any address from the name on your CC in 2 minutes from XXXX"
Wells Fargo & Company,"This complaint is about a {$1800.00} credit card transaction from XXXX/XXXX/2016, and erroneous fees and interest that were charged as a result of this transaction. Wells Fargo Card Services is incorrectly coding the transaction as a cash advance instead of as a purchase. When I first notified Wells Fargo 's dispute department in XXXX 2016, Wells Fargo indicated that they have the ability to reclassify this cash advance transaction as a purchase. As of XXXX XXXX, 2016, these erroneous charges and interest netted to {$92.00} ( {$91.00} Cash Advance Fee from XXXX/XXXX/2016, {$1.00} Minimum Interest Charge from XXXX/XXXX/2016, and erroneous {$10.00} Cash Advance Fee on XXXX/XXXX/2016, and erroneous Cash Advance Refund of {$9.00} refund on XXXX/XXXX/2016 ). The items purchased were XXXX store gift cards ( gift certificates ). In attempt to resolve this issue, I 've called Wells Fargo 's customer service, dispute department, and high dollar dispute department multiple times in XXXX 2016 and XXXX 2016 and have provided them with my customer receipt and merchant testimony that the merchant attempted to process the purchase transaction as a credit card purchase. They tried to deflect blame for this issue to the merchant, XXXX ( dba XXXX ). But it is Wells Fargo that is engaging in unlawful and unethical practices. According to California CIVIL CODE SECTION 1749.45-1749.6 ( a ) It is unlawful for any person or entity to sell a gift certificate to a purchaser that contains any of the following : ( 1 ) An expiration date. ( 2 ) A service fee, including, but not limited to, a service fee for dormancy, except as provided in subdivision ( e ). I contacted XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and was notified that "" XXXX is charging the credit card as a standard charge, and the charge is passed along to the third party bank and being converted to a cash advance charge ''. As of XXXX XXXX, 2016, Wells Fargo came to the conclusion that the {$1800.00} transaction was a cash advance, and proceeded to post the {$1800.00} transaction as a cash advance, along with the disputed related interest and fees. It is unlawful for Wells Fargo to collect cash advance fees from California customers for gift certificate transactions. Furthermore, Wells Fargo has engaged in acts of false advertising by honoring Wells Fargo XXXX points on a similar {$43.00} gift card ( gift certificate ) purchase transaction on XXXX XXXX, 2016 from XXXX. I received Wells Fargo XXXX points from my XXXX XXXX, 2016 XXXX XXXX gift card purchase, and that transaction processed a purchase. I have made numerous purchases from XXXX in 2016 through other credit cards, and all of them have posted as credit card purchase transactions, with the exception of the {$1800.00} transaction. As a credit card user, I should be entitled to XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX points from the {$1800.00} gift certificate purchase on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and should not have to incur the interest or fees due to Wells Fargo 's cash advance coding."

He was not financially capable of repaying this nor did he have any kind of financial literacy regarding credit. This was in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of any of this until he had a balance charged off. XX/XX/XXXX I sent Wells Fargo a letter stating that issuing my son a credit card was in violation of The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of XX/XX/XXXX which states numerous criteria but one of which is that a parent must co-sign which I 'd NEVER do.

Wells Fargo & Company,I had a failure in one of my old HVAC units and I visited with the contractor who fixed it about getting a new system. When I did he told me they had a special 0 % financing for 36 months offer through Wells Fargo. I said that would be great let 's go ahead and do that. So the contact said well let 's see if you are approved for the 0 % financing. So we submitted information online to see if I would be approved fort he amount I needed to replace the units. I was not and that was the end of it. I told him to work on a way to get me approved for the whole amount or he would just have to wait till I saved my nickles to pay for the units outright. I thought everything was fine. A week later I received a credit card from Well 's Fargo for the amount I was approved for. I never knowingly agreed to open a credit card with Well 's Fargo and it is fraudulent for them to take my inquiry as authorization to open an account in my name. This practice needs to be outlawed and Well 's Fargo needs to be fined twice as much as they have made using this fraudulant and misleading new account sales technique.

The number of emails, letters clearly exceed the time and cost of refunding me properly. clearly means customer is not valued. i do not need or want credit card agreement that is because i am not questioning it. i am a good customer and i deserve this esp in light of how this has been hndled. if its not refunded i will now take further action. no scripts needed in the answer no reiteration of how many times i was refunded. since for all those times. you have refunded deadbeats who are past due. just refund it like i was PROMISED do DAMAGE control and to consumer protection finance please publish this. banks need to spend more time getting to know customer than scripting them to death for months making promises they dont keep wasting my precious time."

I partially competed the form and decided to forgo the overdraft protection credit card and asked the form to be destroyed. After I closed my deposit account with the bank I was notified that I had unsettled account balances on a credit card I never authorized. After much back and forth with various representatives the bank had agreed to drop the card and charges which were never authorized. The issue remained as a negative account on my credit bureau for many years. After hearing the unfortunate news that this has happened to others, I wanted to share my experience that predated the recent news article regarding the creation of false accounts and I highly recommend a more thorough investigation be performed as the issue has a longer history than what is currently known."

I explained I was closing the card. Wells Fargo said I could pay directly from my XXXX Bank account. She asked for the account and routing number which I gave her. I checked the Wells Fargo Statement and {$9.00} was owed on the card. I called the number on the back of the card again and spoke with XXXX women. They each explained this charge was interest on the card. I explained the card was paid off and closed. I also requested their explanations of this charge be sent to me in writing. All said this could not be done. The last woman I spoke to, XXXX, finally said the {$9.00} would be waived. I agreed. I checked my XXXX Bank acct on XX/XX/2016 and the {$9.00} had been withdrawn without my agreement. I again called Wells Fargo and was told that Wells Fraud Investigators would contact me. I said to please make note that they should contact me in writing only. Yesterday, I received a phone call from Wells Fargo which I will not return. Also, yesterday I received a letter from Wells Fargo Card Service stating, "" thank you for using our telephone payment service ... .. ''. for payment of the {$9.00}.

I did n't understand that, so on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I went to my files and pulled my bank statements and discovered that Wells Fargo did not send me a credit card statement in XXXX 2016 ( When statements come in from all sources -- banks and utilities, I put them in a little box, in a pile ). Wells Fargo not only failed to send me a statement in XXXX 2016, the bank deactivated my credit card, and sent a negative entry to the credit bureaus, without notifying me. I have been utilizing credit off and on for 45 years, and this sort of thing has never happened to me. It is the most recent statement, XXXX 2016, that shows derogatory information in my account. Wells Fargo knows that I have excellent credit and, therefore, they should have notified me if they believed that I did not make a payment. The truth is, I did not know until recently, when I checked my bank files, that Wells Fargo had not sent me a statement in XXXX 2016 ( I am in the process of designing a spreadsheet that will show the names of all creditors ( banks and utilities ) and the dates on which their statements arrive )."
Wells Fargo & Company,As a customer of Wells Fargo Bank for 6 years I applied for a Cash back credit card. On the application form I filled out my details as suggested and gave all my information. I was denied a credit card on the grounds that I was not a citizen or a green card holder. Upon inquiry I found out that as a resident Alien on an XXXX XXXX that the bank ran a credit check and denied me a card but nowhere on the website does it mention that only citizens or green card holders can apply. I Asked the bank why it was not mentioned on the form and why no banker would mention it? They said it was against Federal Law to to discriminate people while applying. This is misinformation because people apply but they do n't meet the standards for qualifying. So this is a violation of Federal law indirectly and it is discrimination. No other bank would deny me a card based on my citizenship. As long as I have a social security number and a good credit score that should be all the the Banks need. Do look into this matter as Wells Fargo is very discriminatory as to who they provide credit too. I am a resident Alien legally working and paying my taxes and bills on time. I should not be denied basic Banking services based on my citizenship. My credit score took a hit because of misinformation.
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo opened a credit card account that I said I did not want when I opened my checking account. Even after I closed my checking account, they kept my credit card account open without notifying me."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I just learned of the Wells Fargo fraud of credit cards when I heard Senator XXXX speak and read comments on XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I went to the Wells Fargo XXXX Nevada branch to report a Wells Fargo Credit Card on my XXXX credit reports ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) in the amount {$7700.00}. The Wells Fargo employee said "" you will have to handle this yourself. It happened to me too. '' I said "" are you telling me Wells Fargo Bank does not care that someone is using their name to issue credit cards and stealing money ruining people 's credit rating? '' "" No. '' I am furious over this and will do whatever it takes to get my experience with these thieving hacks legally registered. I have not had a credit card for years and years - since maybe XX/XX/XXXX. I did contact all XXXX agencies. I have not been in touch with any of them since b/c I have been working overseas."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I am listed as an authorized user on my husband 's credit card account. I did not give my consent to be an authorized user for Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX.

Wells Fargo & Company,I was surprised when i received the unwanted credit card out of blue which i did not even apply for it. I thought it was because of my good credit score which I have always kept intact and started using it. One fine day when I came back from my vacation it was all used of and it went to collections by my surprise and I have reached out the bankers to get help and they made me pay some minimal amount to get me on track. It did seriously affect my credit score.
Wells Fargo & Company,I do not recognize this account on my Credit Report. Please see the attached letter.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have previously submitted complaints concerning unauthorized charges by Wells Fargo to my credit card for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX and XXXX. I think I should be reimbursed for these fraudulent charges. When Wells Fargo was approaached to respond, their responses were fiction.

Wells Fargo & Company,"My wife passed away on XXXX XXXX, 2016. We were married for 50 years. I notified all of the credit card banks and they all forgave me and my late wife of the money owed the. All but my own bank of Wells Fargo. They said I was co-signer of the card and I must pay them. I reminded them of the Colorado state law that says that I am not responsible for the debt. A month after she died, Wells Fargo said they sent me a credit card for her account. Strange that they would mail me a card a year and a half after ( they say ) I "" verbally '' said I would be a "" co-signer ''. I asked for me to hear the tape they claim to have of me agreeing to be a co-signer. They refused and told me to hire a lawyer. As a former state representative from XXXX, I served on the XXXX. I realize the problems banks are facing but I had no idea that besides me -- there were XXXX XXXX other customers who were LIED to and cheated by Wells Fargo. I will not be intimidated by them and I wo n't pay these corporate "" crooks '' a XXXX. I am XXXX years old and this bank should be there for their customers. I want to file a formal complaint."

I have my vehicle loan through Wells Fargo, and also investments with Wells Fargo. However, I carefully went through my credit files and I have NEVER had, nor requested, a Wells Fargo Credit card.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I had a Security system placed in y home 5 years ago with XXXX XXXX security. I told sales rep I was not wanting a Credit card he was trying to sell. He told me that fine, however sign her for alarm system. Apparently a Credit Card with a limit of {$7500.00} was opened under my name with Wells Fargo.

I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX retiree living on a fixed income. I became a new customer of Wells Fargo in XXXX and opened a checking and savings account. I never opened a Credit Card! I became aware of this in XXXX XXXX when my computer was hacked and I was scammed of {$5000.00} from a Credit Card that I never knew existed. As the scam was unraveling, Wells Fargo notified me that the scammers activated a Credit Card ( that I did not even know that I had ) in my name and advanced {$5000.00}. After my inquiry the bank told me that the card was established in XXXX but had never been activated until XXXX XXXX ( not by me but by the scammers ). Why would someone get a Credit Card and never activate it?? Because they did not authorize or even know that they had it!

When I called them, i came to know that they blocked my card & provided no reason for that. On requesting further details, I have been asked to visit the branch. I requested them that during office hours, I may not visit your branch & kindly provide an alternative. On that note, my request is forwarded to the concern dept & since then I am waiting for call. On calling them to inquire about the update, the officers appears to very rude. 
It has been more than 24 hours but card is blocked & nobody is giving any explanation to me, why they have blocked it. If they need to inquire about any transaction activity or else, they should have called me before blocking my card. I felt very embarrassed at the store. You are requested to take strict action to ensure that going forward any other consumer would n't face such inconvenience."
Wells Fargo & Company,"( XXXX ) I have gone through credit card XXXX. 
I am a victim of the Wells Fargo credit card issue. I had a good credit score. I got a call from a repres there who told me that a credit card for XXXX was being processed for me for. When i questioned the rate it was XXXX first year and XXXX to 28 % afterwards. Things were Not clear. I did not want it. I deserved a better rate with my score and wanted out or a lower rate and it was impossible, i was transferred and put on hold, was told No and ignored. The payments escalated, i paid to avoid my credit being damaged but it was just too much. 
______ ( XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX issue. I always paid them. My balances were fluctuating and i could not get answers. Due to unexpected car repairs i phoned them to just say that the payment would be late and to make arrangements. I was denied. I made payments anyway. Then i received statements showing payments made and then reversed. They could not explain. I kept requesting info and was refused. I kept making payments and in XXXX received a call from XXXX stating that they would no longer accept them. They refused my payments and began harrassing me by phone. XXXX to 30 calls a day. When i told them to stop, they assigned my acct to. XXXX and XXXX. I requested statements etc ..., no info. By accident learned of court date 2 days before. Attorney said show up..guess what? No docs received and no notice of court call. XXXX was not present for roll call and judge said that she could not hear my side. She did not know i was a pre law student who knew better. I was finally able to get a XXXX repres to send me statements nd guess what? Over XXXX was charged ( Identity Theft ). XXXX refused to acknowledge and pursued filing a judgement against me.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I was living temporarily at the US and I had to open a secured card with XXXX $ to be able to contract some services in the US. They took straight away the money from my check account. When I moved to other country I cancelled the card but they said that they needed 90 days to get my money refunded in my account. After that period I checked my account balance and the money did n't appear in the account. When I contacted Wells Fargo customer service they said that they already sent a check to my address, but I was not living there any more! So they told me that I needed to receive in my new mail address an stop affidavit that I had to sign to have my money back. I never received that letter. I asked for it more than twice and it is the only international post mail that is not arriving to my new address. 
Wells Fargo refuses to give my money back despite they know that I never cashed that check. They refuse to use a certified post mail, e-mail or any other method that can ensure that the affidavit is going to arrive to my new mail address. They are literally robbing me XXXX $ because there is no way of having that money back. 
I would advice people to not open any secured card with Wells Fargo ever, they are going to lose their money. It has been more than 3 months fighting with their customer service with no resault."
Wells Fargo & Company,"My daughter and I purchased an adjustable bed from XXXX in XXXX XXXX with free financing for a year. The first payment of approximately {$90.00} was due in XXXX, however, after the XXXX payment, I paid $ 100 monthly. In XXXX I received delivery of Living Room furniture, and thought I would be able to continue paying $ 100 monthly because in XXXX XXXX, I was going to pay off the entire balance. I did not discover until I received a statement from Wells Fargo in either late XXXX or early XXXX that I owed them more money. ( See Exhibit A XXXX Bill Pay XXXX ). On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I made a payment of {$490.00} ( Also See Exhibit D indicating I paid {$390.00} plus my $ 100 monthly payment ) .and Exhibit E, explaining the payment in detail. Sometime in early XXXX I was advised that it was not possible to return my {$390.00} check back. 
I made an arrangement with my daughter starting in XXXX XXXX to pay the additional {$52.00} that Wells Fargo required as minimum payment and she set it up with her banking bill pay for automatic payment every month this year, at which time I intend to pay the balance in full. ( See Exhibit B XXXX Bill Pay spreadsheet ). Upon information and belief, we had satisfied Wells Fargo 's requirements. Today I received the XXXX Statement ( Exhibit C ) indicating that I have a debit of {$430.00} on my account and my monthly payment is now increased {$250.00}. I had to place several calls to Wells Fargo to find out where this debit came from, when it was posted and WHY my minimum payment had increased from {$150.00} to {$250.00} when I 've continually paid them on a monthly basis and have not purchased anything since XXXX XXXX. 
It took the agent some time to find out what had transpired since and the agent finally discovered that the Bank, without my knowledge or approval and despite what I had been told by Wells Fargo Bank which was indicated in my XXXX XXXX, XXXX letter to US Treasury Help with My Bank, I had asked for the {$370.00} back ( {$390.00} minus the {$26.00} in arrears ) and they advised me that : "" that was not possible ''. TODAY, I discovered that they not only retruned the {$370.00} back but also the {$26.00} in arrears back, without my approval or knowledge and have no not only increased my monthly amount due, but also sactioned additional late fees. See E2, E3, E Attachment 1, E Attachment 2 & E Attachment 3.. I do not know when Wells Fargo assessed these charges, I requested the date of the posting but was never advised."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Dear Wells Fargo : Yes, I did receive your letter dated XX/XX/2016 ( scanned & attached on here ), but I did not receive a letter earlier dated XX/XX/XXXX as you stated. I 'd like to reiterate that I did not have nor receive your written communication XX/XX/XXXX ; therefore, I was shocked to learn that Wells Fargo had closed the account. 
While I understand but regret of your earlier response that Wells Fargo has the right to cancel or terminate at anytime, however I respectfully request that my earned points or cash credit from uses of the card until XX/XX/2016 can be redeemed since I had had no knowledge as to why. Although Wells Fargo chose to close or cancel the account as wish at anytime, I regret that I had no known earlier reason ( s ) and hope that Wells Fargo could reconsider to reopen the account, or at least fairly allows customer in my situation to redeem the earned credit as of the closing date. 
Thank you for your consideration and cooperation. I look forward to a fair resolution.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I 've been banking with Wells Fargo for quite sometime and have a mortgage loan, savings and checking accounts, and opened up an XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card last XXXX XXXX WITH Wells Fargo before heading up to XXXX, XXXX for work last year. While working and living up in XXXX I received a solicit ( online or through snail mail of which I cant remember ) from WF Credit services for opening up a new XXXX Credit Card at 0 % balance transfer upon approval. The application was submitted on my end back to Wells Fargo and my application was approved and the funds of XXXX were to be mailed by a check since the credit card I was paying off on was a XXXX Card and they did not except online electronic balance transfers. The account was approved in XXXX XXXX and as weeks passed, I Never received the check to my residence in Florida that was the address that i filed on the application ( during this period in XXXX, I had a family member physically looking for the check to arrive in my personal home mailbox ). I spoke with a WF representative about how the funds were going to be transferred over to me since the check never arrived and the rep explained that the money would put directly into my personal checking account instead and they would get that off to me sometime at the end of XXXX XXXX ( WF could NOT come to a conclusion why the check was not sent off to my Florida address and immediately put a stop on the XXXX check on their end ). NOTE : My correspondence with WF was while I was physically working up in XXXX and I was not returning back into the states until sometime after late XX/XX/XXXX/up to XXXX of XXXX. NOTE : at NO time during any of this process of the money xferred into my account, was anything mentioned in ANY form including spoken or written about the money being transferred to me that my application from XXXX XXXX was accepted for the transfer amount of XXXX but NOT the balance transfer of the card at the 0 % rate that I had initially signed up for in XXXX of XXXX. I dealt on numerous occasions with multiple customer service employees at Wells Fargo after reviewing my online statements that the funds, in fact, had been transferred onto their new Wells Fargo Visa card at XXXX PERCENT and including their XXXX PERCENT TRANSFER FEE from the initial day the funds were electronically transferred into my personal account on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I spoke to Wells Fargo customer representatives at least XXXX or XXXX on numerous occasions explaining that a mistake had been made on this balance transfer and I was concerned about that this was being charged at XXXX percent and was assured that they would resolve the issue and to give it time. Well finally after too much time going by and XXXX XXXX rolling up quickly with no resolution I called on XXXX XXXX and spoke with a XXXX so finally said that he would open up a case for my credit card and I would be hearing back from someone within a day or two. XXXX XXXX received a phone call from a XXXX who was a case manager at the executive office of Credit Cards. Her superiors name is XXXX XXXX and XXXX began to inform me that I had signed a document in XXXX stating that if I had a Wells Fargo Credit card offer already in play ( XXXX XXXX XXXX card I was giving in XXXX XXXX XXXX that I would be DENIED the XXXX Percent transfer rate to the new WF visa card but the funds would still go through of XXXX at a XXXX percent charge of the transfer plus an interest rate at XXXX percent. I asked why I only received half of the contract I signed to open up this new visa card and she explained that they do n't send out any time of rejections or denial responses in regards to the XXXX percent transfer when I do n't meet their qualifications. Offered me two months interest off but still needed to pay at XXXX percent. Nothing resolved ... XXXX interest added now!"
Wells Fargo & Company,"Obtained a Wells Fargo Visa Rewards card, and was upgraded to the XXXX Platinum Rewards card. According to the online marketing information, I was eligible to receive "" Unlimited 5x points on grocery store purchases! '' ( that wording has since been removed from their site. I made purchases that did not violate the T & C 's ( XXXX ), and was sent a letter telling me to cease all purchases that they considered to be against their T & C 's after receiving the letter, else they would be closing my account. I immediately stopped using the card, and they cancelled my account two days later. I had XXXX XXXX rewards points available to me that were placed in a pending status with a date of XXXX, then it was moved to XXXX, then said "" frozen '' and I could not redeem them. Now on the site they simply say "" forfeited ''. 

I did nothing against the Terms and Conditions I signed up for, and Wells Fargo took away all of the rewards I used from their card ( rewards I could have earned elsewhere, but chose to do business with them ). 

I called and they said they could not do anything about the account being closed. 

Now I have a closed by creditor account on my credit report, and they took all my rewards away."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I WAS CONTACTED BY WELLS FARGO BANK ABOUT XXXX OR XXXX, I WAS GIVEN A CREDIT CARD WITH A {$9000.00} CREDIT LIMIT, THEY JUST GAVE IT TO ME I NEVER APPLIED BECAUSE I DID N'T THINK MY CREDIT SCORE AT THE TIME WOULD ALLOW ME TO HAVE THAT MUCH ON A CREDIT CARD LIMIT,. THEY JUST GAVE IT TO ME, AND NATURALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A GIFT FROM XXXX, I USED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES FOR CASH ADVANCEMENTS, AND TO PAY OFF SOME OTHER CREDIT CARD BALANCES, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CONTACTED ME AND SAID DUE TO FURTHER RESEARCH THEY SLASH THE LIMIT FROM {$9000.00} BACK TO {$2500.00}?? THEIR WERE N'T ANY LATE PAYMENTS ON MY PART, THEY JUST CUT THE LIMIT BACK, THEY HAD ALREADY CHARGED ME FOR THE ACCOUNT, AND FEES CONNECTED WITH OPENING THE ACCOUNT AND CASH ADVANCEMENTS, IT DID N'T EVEN REGISTER WITH ME UNTIL I READ THE XXXX XXXX ON XXXX ABOUT WELLS FARGO GOING AFTER XXXX ( I AM XXXX YRS OLD )"
Wells Fargo & Company,On XX/XX/XXXX I was scheduled to close on a home and when the title company pulled a New Mexico public record I was informed of a judgement against me in the XXXX judicial court of NM from Wells Fargo for a credit card opened in XX/XX/XXXX. I Immediately called Wells Fargo to let them know this was not my debt and asked how can I get this resolved since I was supposed to be closing on a home and had already given notice on our current residence. Under direct pressure I asked if they would accept {$1600.00} so I could close on my home and I was given a settlement of {$2900.00} to have the judgement removed. This was far beyond my financial resources especially for a Fraudulant account. I immediately filed a police report. Since then I have spoken to numerous people and the attorney for wellsfargo and have had no help with this matter. We have now lost the house and have been put in a unbelievably dire situation
Wells Fargo & Company,I have been review my credit report and came across an account from Wells Fargo that is not mine. I called Wells Fargo and would not provide any information of that account to me. This account is not mine and should be removed from my credit reports.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying that the volume of activity on my account was suspicious and if it continued they would close my account. I stopped using the card the day I received the letter, but they still closed my account. I would like for the account to be reopened."
Wells Fargo & Company,"XX/XX/2015 I wanted to rebuild my credit so I contacted my banker at Wells Fargo by phone and asked him what are my options to help me achieve the goal. He told me my best option will be to open a secured card with wells fargo and within a year of opening I will be graduated to their unsecured card and have my collateral returned to me. All this sounded good to me and I agreed to put a collateral of {$300.00} down to get a credit limit of {$300.00}. The card was working fine and I thought I might change my limit to {$600.00} so I put an additional {$300.00} for collateral for a credit increase. Everything was working great. But after 1 year had passed and I did not see any change happen on the account I contacted the customer service via phone to see what was going on this. I was transferred to a supervisor ( His name was XXXX ), who had a look at my account and said that I should have already been graduated and he will email the corporate to look into this and I shall hear back within a week. So I waited a week and called back yesterday again and I was told by another supervisor ( name XXXX ) and then finally by a representative from the credit customer care that the previous supervisor lied to me straight up and they can not do anything about it ( this was all on a recorded line ). So after being super frustrated that a supervisor will lie to a customer right on the face on a recorded line I asked so what is happening with my graduation to be told that they can not say anything as this is a automated process while being super rude about it. So basically what it boils down to is that the banker at the branch did n't tell me everything and just opened an account on the pretense that I will be getting my collateral back within a year. He did not take any signature or anything and just verbal confirmation ( which according to law is as good as a contract ). I feel super cheated by wells fargo and looking at their recent wrongdoing findings makes me question if I will ever see that {$600.00} back. This and on top of they have kept charging me annual fees for breaking their own promise and a representative of the company speaks for the company itself. So I will like my money back oir need to know why was lied to and defrauded by the banker ( just to meet his sales numbers? ). And all what I have written can be looked in the recorded conversation that wells fargo has had with me."
Wells Fargo & Company,I open an accouny with dillards onXXXXXXXX made a payment on XXXX and they still send me a bill with a late fee. Saying i paid my bill too early. The penalized me for paying early.
Wells Fargo & Company,I have been charged erroneous late fees multiple times from wells fargo. They continue to do this and refuse to remove their mistakes.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I just received, and the co-owner of my home also received, a credit card from Wells Fargo. The XXXX cards had the same account number. Neither one of us requested such a card or applied for such a card. I have never had an account with Wells Fargo. Since Wells Fargo had already been fined for such activity, this is really unacceptable. Clearly the fine for their unethical activity was far too small since they continue to start accounts which were never requested."
Wells Fargo & Company,"On more than a half dozen occasions, Wells Fargo has charged me late fees for payments made on time. My payment is due on the XXXX of each month. This past month, my bill was in the amount of {$250.00} and was due on XX/XX/2016. Wells Fargo mails the monthly invoices sometime between the XXXX and the XXXX of the month. For the bill due XX/XX/2016, they mailed the invoice on XX/XX/2016. I paid my bill by automatic payment on XX/XX/2016. Because it arrived before they mailed the invoice, they did not credit it to the XX/XX/2016 and charged me a late fee. Essentially, they have created a variable period within each billing cycle where I can not make a payment. In this past month 's case, any payment made between XX/XX/2016 ( the day the XX/XX/XXXX invoice was due, and was paid in full ) and XX/XX/2016 ( the day after they mailed the invoice ) would float in the ether and not be credited towards the invoice due for that billing period. This has happened over and over and over. I have filed several XXXX complaints and each time Wells Fargo reverses the payment. It requires constant vigilance. I can not believe other consumers are not being hit with these fees too."
Wells Fargo & Company,Enormous fees from unknown/questionable cash advances.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I am trembling with anger over this situation. I work in the financial field, and I do not like to bash or make complaints about the services offered, but I feel that this must be done so that changes can be made. 

I am staying at a hotel, and I have a credit card that I enjoy using. I like the company, the payments are very reasonable, and I am glad to have the card. I made an extra payment on my card so that I would have that balance available to pay for my room, as I am having some repairs/upgrades completed on my home. I chose to use this card for this situation because it is a rewards card that offers points. I made the payment online, or on my mobile app -- I do n't remember -- but it states "" Transactions submitted by midnight XXXX XXXX will be sent immediately and will take effect the same day. '' So, I felt confident that the credit would be available for use immediately, as I made the payment at approximately XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the day before. However, when the hotel tried to run my card, it was declined. I called my card company to try to find out why the credit was not available. I spoke to a rep who was very nice, and he even spoke to his supervisor, but there was nothing he could do to make the credit available, and they were also unable to increase my credit limit to accommodate my dilemma. 

This entire situation should not have occurred. If the payment is not going to post as available credit immediately, or not even by the next business day, which was today, then the information on the website should not state that it will be. In my opinion, this is a deceptive practice. I could have used a different card, or given the hotel cash to pay for my room instead of putting the money on my card. I am on a very tight budget, but even if I was n't, this is totally unacceptable. I need 100 % clear knowledge of when my payments are going to post as available credit, as I am sure everyone does. At this point, I feel duped and lied to, and now I have to come up with {$200.00} from somewhere else because of this situation. This is more than just a simple inconvenience for me ; this is an embarrassing and unnecessary situation that has caused me a bit of financial hardship."
Wells Fargo & Company,"A balance transfer was made from my Wells Fargo Visa card account to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account on XXXX XXXX, 2016 in response to a Wells Fargo Promotional Balance offer solicited by mail to me ; the transfer was for {$10000.00} with a 4 % balance transfer fee, and I would enjoy a 2.9 % APR for 12 months. 
In response to questions I made, it was stipulated that "" payments above your Minimum Payment Due will be applied to your highest rate balance first ''. 
My complaint is that payments I have been making, all above the Minimum Payment Due, have been paying down the Promotional balance with a 2.9 % APR, which is now reduced to {$7000.00} from the original {$10000.00}, while my Purchases Balance remains at about {$2500.00}, with a 17.1 % APR. 
This practice is a case of a fraudulent and mis-leading promotion which is contrary to common sense for a consumer taking out such a transfer with a 4 % fee, and not enjoying the promotional APR of 2.9 % for the full term on the balance transfer amount."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I was attempting to finish getting my late husband 's affairs in order when I noticed a fraudulent charge on our old account. After going through an extended process with Wells Fargo for them to even speak with me about the account, I was told that because he did not file a police report immediately after the fraud there was nothing they could do. This happened near the end of his life when he was unable to even sign his own name, let alone file a police report. I have told them that I am happy to file a police report but they have told me this does not matter, I only wish they follow the laws pertaining to fraud."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Our furnace went out and XXXX company approved us over the telephone for a Wells Fargo credit card. They fixed furnace and the we paid more than the minimum each month and when the balance was down to about {$1300.00} they charged us {$1000.00} in interest. They claim it was a "" deal '' they offered of XXXX no interest if paid in full. Even though the balance was {$1300.00} at end of 12 mos they charged over 28 % interest on the highest daily balance. We were never told this by Wells Fargo or the XXXX XXXX. We asked Wells Fargo to remove the interest charge and we 'd pay off the balance. They said no and so sorry. This is predatory lending at it minimum and outright fraud."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Hi, I was enrolled in the Wells Fargo Go Far Rewards program to earn bonus points on purchases. On my billing day, without any notification or explanation, they closed the account and forfeited all my points earned totaling {$930.00} in XXXX 2016. I filed a complain online, after waiting for some time, they requested a phone call. After I called and spoke to two different people on XXXX/XXXX/2016, they had no idea either regarding the closure of my credit card account or the forfeiture of my points. They said to wait for correspondence from their corporate office."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo just decided to close my credit card with out my prior approval. They are stating that my card has over six months inactivity. I have paid off my Wells Fargo card and have a zero balance, therefore I do n't understand why they closed my card?! The letter Wells Fargo sent me ( dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 ) also indicated "" High Balance ( s ) as compared to the credit limit ( s ) or revolving line ( s ) of credit on credit report. '' Another reason is "" Low payment ( s ) as compared to balance ( s ) in the last year on your Wells Fargo credit card ''. This makes no sense, since all payments have been timely. I have paid off all my credit cards including the Wells Fargo card in order to avoid debt and this is what I get?! I called the Wells Fargo customer service line on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and they were unable to help me ; the representative said that I needed to call XXXX. I will try them again tomorrow to see if they can reinstate my card. This is very unethical to say the least! Banks should not unilaterally close your cards as a sort of punishment for simply paying them down to zero. Please HELP!!!"
Wells Fargo & Company,"I need you do something this company is stolen my money I resquest to them a file a dispute against a company and they just transfer me over and over without result after days trying to do this ; a agent with really bad attitude answered the call and place the issues on top of that after contact them, I call a month after and they just transfer again my calls and they just said I have to wait!!! this is incredible I 'm still waiting without results and this company just stole money from people"
Wells Fargo & Company,"Well, It all started in 2007 when I applied for a secure credit card with Wells Fargo Bank. I put down XXXX to open it the credit card. I did n't use the card that much, only to rent cars to go out of town. At the end of last year I found out that the secure credit card was no longer a secure credit card but a unsecured card card. I had called Wells Fargo Bank to check out my balance for my secured card and that was when the banker informed my that my card was unsecured. At that time I asked the teller where was the money I had put down to open the card and he said they had sent me the money {$1200.00} check in the mail. I told them I never received any check from them and he said that the check was returned to them because of incorrect address. I then asked them can they mail the check back to me with the correct address, but he said no because it was sent to the Nevada XXXX and I would have to contact them. 
I had contacted the Nevada XXXX but they said that nothing in their system show a check sent to them in my name. They looked through their system with my different names ( last ) and also with my social security number but NOTHING. I have called back and forth with Wells Fargo, I even went to a branch to try and get some answers but no luck, I 've also been dealing with Nevada XXXX with no luck. I am SO tired with Wells Fargo Bank giving me the run around. I need some answers or better yet my money that I am entitled to. PLEASE HELP!!!!!"
Wells Fargo & Company,"I recently found out about the Wells Fargo lawsuit. Last year I was contacted by a collection agency XX/XX/XXXX saying I had a credit card through Wells Fargo, which I do n't ever recall opening, thinking my ex may have opened it, and being that I am trying to get my credit situation in order I paid off the debt. The debt collector was XXXX in XXXX, IL. They said the account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX and closed in XX/XX/XXXX. I tried contacting Wells Fargo but they kept giving me the run around and telling me they did n't have that information I would have to contact the Debt collector. After I heard of the lawsuit and read the court file I needed to contact someone and try to see if this was one of those accounts and if I would qualify for some sort of reimbursement."
Wells Fargo & Company,"On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a payment of {$1700.00} to Wells Fargo on a XXXX department credit card with a balance o {$1500.00}. I sent more to cover any additional financial charges to pay this account off. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo applied the payment to my card leaving {$130.00}, I called on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm when I would receive my credit back and was told at that time I would receive in 2-4 week. On XX/XX/XXXX I call to confirm payment was received, and that I had a credit of {$130.00}. I was told that I should receive the check by XX/XX/XXXX. I called a 3rd time and told them I had not received my check on XX/XX/XXXX. I received my billing statement around XX/XX/XXXX that showed they had applied the {$1700.00} and I had a credit of {$130.00} refunded on XX/XX/XXXX. Again I was told I should receive the refund by XX/XX/XXXX ( Different date than XX/XX/XXXX ). My 4th call on XX/XX/XXXX I told them I had not received my check, Wells Fargo responded it would be by XX/XX/XXXX, yet again different date. We are now one month from the time they applied my payment on XX/XX/XXXX. 5th call to Wells Fargo was made on XX/XX/XXXX, I told them I had not received my check, it went from the Representative, to the Supervisor, to an Executive Officer, to a Corporate Compliance Researcher. I was told they would have to cancel my check and I would have to wait another 30 days to receive my credit. The gave me a case number XXXX. On XXXX ( 40 days from applying my payment ) I called XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ext XXXX, three times and my calls went straight to her voice mail. She has not returned my call, Well Fargo has had 3 business days to research why and tell when I will receive my refund and I have not heard any thing back from them. I have attached my last billing statement to show when the credit was applied and when they said they refunded my money however they can not product any documentation showing a check has been chased or if they even mailed the check. I 've waited 40 days for this and was counting on that refund to help pay off another debit. I have gotten no where with Wells Fargo, I keep getting bounced from one rep to another or my call to XXXX XXXX are not being returned. In light of what Wells Fargo has done to other customers in the news, I want my money back so I can close out my account and leave this company. I need someone to help me.

Wells Fargo & Company,"Wellsfargo credit card has promotional 0 % balance transfer and it 's good product but i have noticed on my statement that where it says "" promotional balance '' it says the balance owned and the APR and balance subject to interest rate and days in billing cycle and interest charge. Now what is missing which is critical information is the date the balance is due. I find that something that needs to be fixed asap. It 's not fair toe the consumer not to be able to have that info on the statement. Thank did say that it 's for "" security reason '' but she her self and her supervisor said that does n't make senses either. but i wanted to the BCFP to look at this and fix the issue."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Dear Sir, I was charged excessive late fees on a secured credit card by Wells Fargo Bank- representing an effective 1,000 % interest rate and over XXXX % of my collateral. The late fees were automatically charged, my account was subsequently closed and missed payments were reported to credit agencies. The bank had failed to notify me either electronically or via paper in spite of me updating the bank staff of this change of address. I have also spent several months trying to get the bank to reverse the several charges they have charged - an effective 1000 % + on a completely securitized line. The bank customer service and executive office seems to only want to find a way to legalize those charges and do not want to take any accountability for excessive fees and charges. While the enrollment process I was told that this secured credit card would only hurt my credit scores. I have no other option that to use this forum to hope for a correction in their methods and processes used."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Good morning, on XXXX XXXX i went to wells Fargo bank because there was a car i wanted to buy it was a used car, XXXX of all before i went to the bank i called them before about a loan of {$4000.00}, they called me the next day which was XXXX XXXX to come to the bank and get the loan approved, so i went to the bank to sign for the loan, I XXXX of all ask them what the interest rate was, they said it was 11.240 % the payment was suposed to be {$130.00} for 36 months, on top of this loan they ran my credit and the credit score was XXXX so alone the line as soon as i finished with the signing of the paper, the banker who was attended to me said an idea. That my credit was really good, that i was aproved for 0.00 % for 15 months and i said that was a wise idea. the introductory fee was {$5.00} or 3 % of the amount of each balance transfer, whichever is greater for 15 months. He ran my credit and said im approved for the amount of {$8500.00} with 0.00 % APR. I said okay so he printed out the paper, then asked me to sign. He told me that once i received the card i should come to the bank to do the balance transfer. Then after so day i received the card in the mail, to activate the card, and then get to the back the same banker that attended to me, he called the XXXX number in the bank, he asked them about the card and confirmed that the card was indeed 3 % my mind was if it was n't what the banker said then i would not go through with the card but it was, so they did the balance transfer in the bank there to pay of the XXXX XXXX dollars loan, then after that i went home, the next 2 days i checked my online banking and saw that the loan was still balanced {$21.00} after i payed of the loan, the I called and payed off the {$21.00} after another 2 days i checked my online banking and find out that the same loan i already paid off had another balance of {$1.00} so i called then and they said it was their mistake and they 'll clear it off, then after that on the XXXX of XXXX i found out that the credit card that was supposed to be 0 % APR for 15 months not has an interest rate of {$51.00} and a payment due on the XXXX XXXX of {$230.00} Then i was concerned and i called the XXXX number again and they said that there was never a 0 % APR and the APR was 21 % i was like Really? And I told them i have all the documents stating it was 0 % APR and he told me to take it to the bank after that i getto the back and the banker took the paper from me and called the XXXX number on the credit card, and talked to them, After the banker had talked to them they Refereed him to page XXXX of that book that said if you have closed a credit card account with wells Fargo within 16 months you will not qualify for that card, I then told the banker how then did i qualify for this card with my credit score of XXXX and he said "" oh i 'm sorry its my fault I did n't read that far to see all that '' then i said what are we gon na do call all the bank manager and get everybody involved for this mistake, then he said that even if he told the manager there is nothing they can do about it, but they could find a way to help by asking for another loan with a low interest to pay off this one since i have good credit, then i said ok fine then they ran the loan and told me they 'd give me feed back later so i went home, 20 minutes later they called me back and told me it was approved and i should come and sign again, so i asked on what Interest rate? he said 17 % then i said no way im gon na fight for this because i dont what someone to fall victim to this because it has been going on for a long, because if anybody lies to take somebody 's money or lure them into what he/she does n't want to do that 's fraud and this is going on in the back there. As a good citizen of the united states I wo n't allow for this to happen to anyone or me again, please carefully go through this story I have documents to backup"
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo solicited an application for a Home Rebate credit card. The employee who solicited the additional business from us misrepresented the terms of the card. 

He clearly and repeatedly said that the card came with a {$0.00} balance transfer fee, and confirmed it in response to my written question. Here is a chronology of his contact with us. I have the complete records in my files. 

Wells Fargo credit card offer timeline XXXX XXXX, 2013 - Husband receives a call from employee in the XXXX office. [ We had never heard of him and had not been in contact with anyone about the matters he wanted to discuss. ] He reviews our current business and says he has a good offer that will save us money : Among an assortment of several other dubious offers, he said that we could transfer a portion of our HELOC to a new "" Home Rebate Credit Card, '' for which we are prequalified because we are "" such great customers. '' The credit card will be 0 % interest for 12 months. 

Husband says to call me ( wife ). 

XXXX XXXX, 2013 - After I turned down the other offers the employee offered a "" Home Rebate Credit Card '' that will rebate a certain amount of cash against our home mortgage. The interest rate on the card would be 0 % for twelve months. I asked about the balance transfer fee. He said it is {$0.00}. 

He then asks about our retirement fund assets and proposes that we bring our statements in for a review. 

I ask to see the credit card terms in writing. He says he will email them. 

He sends an email requesting certain documentation for the credit card application ( which I donot send but he finds the information within Wells Fargo 's own records ) and including a credit card disclosure statement. The disclosure says that there is a balance transfer fee of 3 %. I emailed XXXX questioning the discrepancy between the {$0.00} fee he represented and the 3 % balance transfer fee in the disclosure statement. 

XXXX XXXX, 2013 - He emails back that the fee is {$0.00}, which he writes, "" was in the offer and will be in the disclosures that are being mailed to you. '' I still did n't see the XXXX balance transfer fee in what he sent, but decided to wait and see what the disclosure that comes with the card will say. 

A week or so later - The card arrives. Not only is the balance transfer fee not {$0.00}, it is 4 % -- higher than the 3 % in the disclosure that was sent. I made several calls to Wells Fargo to inquire about the discrepancy and was informed that there were no 0 % balance transfer fee offers and that I must have misunderstood. 

In the end I made a huge fuss, wrote to the manager and cc 'd XXXX XXXX, among others and received "" an exception '' to allow me a 0 % balance transfer. My problem was solved, but I wonder if similar misrepresentations were made to others."
Wells Fargo & Company,"wells fargo is under scrutiny now. back in summer i was promised on uly 1 interest on my card XXXX to be credited it was not now i closed it and i will not pay the interest. i am tired of the greed lies and poor resolution of this bank. all the dumb calls emails leading nowhere its long overdue for accountabillity not paying XXXX dollars also on my business accouint ending XXXX it was closed without my permission AFTER waivers were promised that never came so i did not use the account. 
wells fargo spends a lot of money paying people to do nothing or send dumb emails and scripts but no hep. resolve both please. i am tired of this horrible treatment, wasting my time etc. and lies i had an account opened without my permission too i will be reporting. SHAME on you. i never gave permission to close business account nor was it appropriate to do so"
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo closed my credit card without notice. I 've had an account with them since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ; it 's the oldest on my credit report. I have never made a late payment. 

Today, I received a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating that my account had been closed due to inactivity for 6 months. When I called them, they stated that they would have to do another hard pull of my credit report in order to reopen the account. 

This puts me between a rock and a hard place : the closure of my oldest account, which has perfect payment history, is obviously bad for my credit score. But a hard inquiry for a credit card will also hurt my credit score for the next two years. 

Wells Fargo claims that they sent a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, indicating that they would close my account if I did not respond. There is no way to know if this is true, as I never received this letter and it was not sent via certified mail. I was also on vacation from XXXX until XXXX, as Wells Fargo was aware, since my travel plans were registered with them well in advance. 

Customer service representatives confirm that WF did not call me, email me, or send me a secure message via their website. It is my belief that they intended for me *not* to receive this message -- considering that they have exclusively delivered my credit card electronically, for years, I see no other reason why WF would eschew modern means of communication. 

It is absurd and unacceptable Wells Fargo would silently terminate what is by far my longest credit relationship -- I opened the account at age XXXX ; I am now XXXX -- without any notice. The expression "" XXXX '' has never felt more pertinent : in exchange for responsible use of credit, they have forced me into a situation that is *guaranteed* to adversely affect my credit score."
Wells Fargo & Company,I have been fighting for a long time to have this fraud account remove from all XXXX credit bureau.

Wells Fargo & Company,Wells Fargo received a {$300.00} payment towards an existing credit card account on XXXX/XXXX/16 and then misplaced the funds. They did not credit my account and subsequently charged me a late fee and additional interest on the the account. I have confirmed with my paying bank that the funds were received by Wells Fargo and they refuse to credit my account the funds received. I have contacted them three times by phone and I continually get no resolution. This is theft my my funds.
Wells Fargo & Company,"This complaint involves a transaction with Wells Fargo Bank. On XX/XX/XXXX I signed up for a Premium XXXX account after being solicited by this company. The email I received said that I should cancel this account by XX/XX/XXXX, a Saturday or I would be charged a {$570.00}. XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I had a pulled hamstring muscle and was unable to walk and also sick with the flu. I intended to cancel the Linked In account on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX but due to the above distractions I forgot to cancel on XX/XX/XXXX. At around XX/XX/XXXX on Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX I remembered that I had forgotten to cancel my Premium XXXX account and I emailed XXXX saying I was canceling it. However, no one from XXXX answered my email and XXXX does not have a phone number. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I phoned Wells Fargo Bank and the representative I spoke to said that the charge of {$570.00} had not yet cleared my account. So I asked her to stop the charge since I think technically that the money is mine until the transaction clears. I know that you can stop payment on a check and assume the rules are the same with a credit card transaction. This representative said she could n't stop the charge because the money had n't yet cleared my account so I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor I talked to said she would put a claim on my account which is claim number XXXX. She said I would hear from the bank about this claim in ten days. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Wells Fargo saying they had completed their investigation and they would send me a letter explaining it. However, I have n't yet gotten a letter from them. I also noticed that Wells Fargo had not credited the {$570.00} to my account. I called today and a banker said the claim had been closed. I assume, therefore that Wells Fargo will not be crediting my account for this amount because they would already have put the money back into my account."
Wells Fargo & Company,"This issue is on a Wells Fargo XXXX : 1. I had a {$25.00} minimum payment due on XXXX/XXXX/16 2. I made a payment of {$32.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16 which they did n't apply to my card 3. I made a payment of {$610.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16 which they did n't apply to my card 4. I made a payment of {$650.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16 which they did n't apply to my card 5. I made a payment of {$1000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16 which they did n't apply to my card 6. I was then charged a {$39.00} late payment fee on that {$25.00} minimum payment This makes no sense to me no matter how they try to explain it. Basically my payments were too early or too late even though they were all paid in the same month. I paid {$2300.00} towards my credit card balance in the month of XXXX when I only had a {$25.00} minimum payment due, but somehow they were able to charge me a {$39.00} late fee."
Wells Fargo & Company,"On XXXX/XXXX/16, I had a problem with my car stalling out on the highway. It was towed to XXXX of XXXX XXXX. The diagnosis was that both my left side and right side fuel pumps were malfunctioning. They were able to repair the left side, but found the right side pump to be on national back order. The car, upon leaving their shop, was operational, but when starting it, had a delay due to the right side fuel pump having to be doctored by them to function somewhat. I paid {$1200.00} for their labor and parts. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I decided to have a second opinion on it with a repair shop much closer to my home and took it to XXXX XXXX automotive of XXXX, Florida. When I brought it in, I specifically told them about my previous situation and that the right side fuel pump was on national back order ( by the way, I also had this information verified by a XXXX XXXX center in XXXX XXXX ). When you review the invoice for XXXX, it clearly affirms what I told them ... .that the fuel pump was on national back order. a couple of days later, I was called by them to inform me that they had found the fuel pump! Elated, I brought the car back to them and had them do the repair. Upon picking it up, however, I still noticed the original delay in starting the car. When I got home, I looked at the invoice more carefully and found that they had replaced the very same left side fuel pump that the original mechanic had already done! As such, duplicate work was done. I tried to work with XXXX and all I was told that was, basically, I would have to bring the car back in and pay more labor. I would like to point out that I did not dispute the entire amount of the invoice ( {$1000.00} ), but only for the duplicate part and some of the labor as I felt they were warranted to be paid something for their time and effort, so I disputed {$820.00}. I disputed this amount with my credit card through Wells Fargo. I turned in this dispute in XXXX of 2016 and it was not filed by them until XXXX/XXXX/2016. The repair outlet had 60 days to respond and, per the guidelines of Wells Fargo in disputes, I was to receive any response from this company ... .I did not. I had to request the answer from Wells Fargo last week and I got it three days ago via mail. My dispute was not accepted due to the fact that they felt that the repair center did work on the car ... .even though it was duplicate work already done by the first repair company. I do not understand how anyone could agree that duplicate work and getting the same part that was replaced before is acceptable. XXXX XXXX XXXX certainly did not order the right side fuel pump and simply replaced the same XXXX that had been replaced a few weeks earlier. the owner of the XXXX XXXX did want me to bring the car back in, but pay for even more labor to rectify their mistake."
Wells Fargo & Company,"XX/XX/2015 I called Wells Fargo to inquire about settling my credit card for a lesser amount than due. My goal was to use money from my tax return to get rid of debt and improve my credit. After talking with the representative about a possible settlement, I told him I needed to do some research and talk to my husband before committing to a settlement. I made sure to say, "" Now I would like to make it clear that I am not agreeing to this settlement, '' as I knew the conversation was being recorded. I was told by the representative that I could think about it and he would have his manager call me the following day, Saturday, and I could decide then. Later on that day, I found out that such a settlement would negatively affect my credit. So my husband and I decided it was n't a good idea and I planned on communicating this to the manager that was supposed to call the following day. 
Well, I never spoke to a manager or received any call from Wells Fargo on that Saturday and the phone number I was given did not have weekend hours. Needless to say, my account was debited over {$3000.00} for a settlement I never agreed to. I called immediately upon realizing the money had been withdrawn from my account. Wells Fargo agreed this was done in error. The funds were returned and the settlement was reversed. I believed all was well. Until, several months later when I inquired about a limit increase on this same credit card ( as I was going on vacation ) and was told that my account had been closed because of a settlement. However, there was never a settlement. Now I have a closed account with a balance. This status is negatively affecting my credit. I have worked hard to maintain a very good credit score. This situation has caused my score to drop several points. Additionally, I had to get another credit card, and could only qualify for {$1500.00} limit. Not to mention the several inquiries to find a credit card I could qualify for. 

All I did was inquire about the particulars of a settlement and now I have a closed account with a balance which affects my credit and my eligibility for loans, credit cards, and different products offered through Wells Fargo and other institutions. Not only is this unfortunate, it is unfair and I would like this rectified as soon as possible. My husband and I have been customers of Wells Fargo for over 10 years. We are now planning on buying a home and this unnecessary ding to our credit has been an ongoing problem that has had a domino affect on other aspects of our finances. For over a year now, I have called Wells Fargo several times, spoken to bankers at my local branch, stayed on the phone for hours, been hung up on "" due to disconnections '', been promised that managers, supervisors, and other specialists were going to call me back to help me resolve this issue. I was even told that they had fixed the issue. But, my most recent credit report shows this was all to no avail. I am so frustrated and feel that I have been wronged in many ways. As a customer, I feel unappreciated, disrespected, and as if my business has absolutely no value at all to Wells Fargo. It is extremely important that this is rectified. 

I have attached the bank statement that shows the unauthorized charge and the subsequent reversal the next day. I also included the letter I later faxed to Wells Fargo."
Wells Fargo & Company,"We have Wells Fargo banking accounts. A banker was promoting Wells Fargo 's Visa card by saying if we apply a card and pay our cell phone bills once a cell phone is damaged or lost we will get a replacement with no question to be asked and indeed he got his own cell phone replaced. We applied a card and always pay cell phone bills by the card. Our daughter 's iphone got damaged and we took it to an XXXX. The XXXX replaced the damaged XXXX by a new XXXX, and we paid some {$300.00}. We filed card benefit claim by supplementing the XXXX receipt. The Wells Fargo benefit office found the excuses of not honoring this claim. 1st they said, we needed manufacturer 's cost estimate. Well, I called by explaining XXXX already replaced the damaged iphone. A representative acknowledged it as making a sense. Then no response for a long time until I called again. This time I was told I needed to get diagnoses. The damaged phone got replaced on XXXX XXXX! and already got replaced by then."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a credit card with Wells Fargo that I never recalled opening it, and I have had it for 3 years. It is a college student credit card account with several hundreds credit line. I thought it was a mistake unintentionally made by myself or the bank, but after I found about Wells Fargo disgusting sales tactic/unauthorized credit card issuance on the news, everything starts to connect in my head. This is a scam in the name of a big bank, and this scam affects millions of banking customers without knowing they are a victim of a top-down system. I want to get this account closed and all the fee/interest/charges and what not under this credit card account waived and/or refunded as soon as possible. This is to bring back the justice to the poor customers who fell victim to a sickening Wells Fargo banking system."
Wells Fargo & Company,"unfortunately no one has contacted me, I 'm angry and frustrated with this situation, you really need to do something with this BANK Wells Fargo, almost 3 months of this problem and not call, no one left not knowing me what has happened with my dispute case that I place from XXXX XXXX 2016 I 'm attaching you again the information.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I had a credit card account and checking account with Wells Fargo. The credit card account had a cashback program in which I had built a healthy balance.

This also resulted in damage to my credit score."
Wells Fargo & Company,"In XXXX of 2016 I was a victim of credit card fraud. I reported the fraudulent charges to Wells Fargo Bank. Wells Fargo took a report, canceled the credit card and told me they would issue me a new card. I later received a document stating that the claims and transactions I disputed were verified by Wells Fargo to be not allowed by me and they were removed from my credit card balance. I still had not yet received a new card and was also not able to access my credit card balance online nor make a payment. Around XXXX XXXX of 2016 I contacted Wells Fargo after receiving a letter stating that I needed to make a payment towards my account balance. I was transferred to XXXX different people who were all having trouble even locating my account. I told them I was unable to see my balance nor make payment and had not yet received a new card. Finally, after some time they said the problem was that they had not issued me a new card, and once they did that account would be accessible online and I could start making payments once again. I disputed the late fees and charges due to not being able to access nor gain information my account, but we never came to an agreement on those charges. Today, XXXX XXXX, 2016 after still not receiving my new card and still not able to access my account, neither online nor via phone ( when I tried to access it via phone I would received an automated response stating "" We 're sorry we can not continue with this transaction '' and then I would be disconnected. After speaking to XXXX different people I was finally informed that my account had gone into collections even though I had not yet received my card not had access to my account as was promised to me by Wells Fargo. I tried to handle this matter and yet the things that were agreed upon on Wells Fargo 's end never came to fruition."
Wells Fargo & Company,"On or about XXXX/XXXX/2016 noticed a charge of {$620.00} on my Wells Fargo Visa credit card for XXXX XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/2016, having not made such a charge I contacted Wells Fargo and initiated a dispute. Eventually I was told the charge was proper based upon the merchant showing proof of the charge and that the merchandise was received by me and because the card was n't reported stolen, as such the dispute was closed saying I owed. Then I filed a dispute in writing by fax and was told the charge was improper and they was crediting the {$620.00}. Then around XXXX XXXX or XXXX I observed my available credit had gone from more than {$2000.00} to {$100.00}. Low and behold, they lowered my credit line, did n't say a word to me about it. I sent another dispute on that issue XXXX/XXXX/2016. Awaiting a response but believe they have little to no business ethics."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I applied for a credit card at a Wells Fargo branch. After several minutes I was turned down. Quite surprised and embarrassed because I know my FICO score is XXXX. I waited for the letter of explanation and it said "" we are unable to offer you a credit card for the following reasons-Repossession on credit report ( property taken back due to non-payment ) ''. I know this had to be a mistake and became immediately concerned. I called Wells Fargo and they told me to pull my free credit report from XXXX. I did & the report is perfect. Spoke to an XXXX rep who confirmed this and said there is nothing on the report that would cause credit to be denied. I called Wells back and they said XXXX XXXX XXXX reported it. I then called XXXX and they said I 've been a perfect customer for 15 years and they reported nothing negative. So now it 's XXXX negatives from XXXX & XXXX negatives from XXXX XXXX. I call Wells back with this information and now they say "" you returned a leased car early '' which I did under a special program offered by XXXX. Wells Fargo for some inexplicable reason considers that as a "" repossession for non payment '' and automatically denies the application. At least I now know my credit is still perfect and it 's Wells Fargo 's application review process that 's defective. Certainly an aggravating experience over the last week."
Wells Fargo & Company,"After recently refinancing with Wells Fargo for our mortgage, my wife and I were issued credit cards that we did not authorize or were ever made knowledgeable of. The only reason we discovered this was when the cards were mailed to us."
Wells Fargo & Company,account was used under my name and wells fargo seems to be unwilling to get it taken care of ... charged me fees and made me make payments ... also continue to report to credit bureaus ... i 'm even wondering if I even applied for it after all the information that has come to light ... they will not asset or even listen.. they need to be investigated and find millions I know Im not the only XXXX to be singled out for them to be able to bill fees and take advantage
Wells Fargo & Company,"After I submitted a complaint to Wells Fargo then the CFPB about the misleading advertising on their Wells Fargo Rewards card, Wells Fargo responded to both and did not do anything except dismiss the claim and point to their lengthy terms and conditions as evidence they are in compliance with their own terms and conditions. Then on XXXX/XXXX/16, I received a statement from Wells Fargo showing that they forfeited XXXX points on my Wells Fargo card because I complaint to the CFPB when I am not supposed to. I contacted Wells Fargo customer service and they told me the same thing and will have a floor manager contacted me within 5-7 business days to further explain the rationale the points forfeiture. It is unethical for Wells Fargo to punish a customer for raising a complaint about bad customer service or misleading adveristing."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo is soliciting their CC customers for balance transfers and subsequently turning their card products into "" no grace period on current purchase '' as a result of the cardholder taking out a BT offer."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Well Fargo continues to violate federal laws and keeps charging me late fees and interest fees on a credit card account that was closed over a year ago. This is the second complaint in less than a month because Wells Fargo is still charging me excessive fees on my closed credit card. Please read my previous complaint made with CFPB, case number XXXX. Wells Fargo has also charged me excessive overdraft and several other types of fees on my checking and savings accounts. Wells fargo is charging me excessive fees on all of the accounts and products that I have with them. Wells Fargo also charged me excessive late fees and high interest fees on a closed auto loan. Wells Fargo has continued to charge excessive fees even after these accounts were closed. I had a checking account, savings account, business checking account and a business savings account all opened without my consent or knowledge. All of these accounts were not visible on my online banking and I never received bank statements for those accounts. These accounts kept getting several monthly severice fees and other fees and I never even knew these accounts existed. Every direct deposit of my paycheck gets taken away by Wells Fargo as an account right off on the accounts that were opened without my consent. Those accounts had received several fees before they closed and wells fargo keeps making account right offs and withdrawing my money from my checking account to pay off the excessive fees on the accounts that were opened without my consent and that were closed due to inactivity with large negative balances from the fees."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Through Wells Fargo 's online portal, I paid the full outstanding balance owing on my Wells Fargo VISA on XX/XX/XXXX. This payment was made 4 days prior to the due date of XX/XX/XXXX for a minimum payment. 
Wells Fargo sent me an email stating that my payment was successfully made on XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo then reported me to credit agencies as being 30 days late on the payment and revoked my credit card even though I have made every credit card payment on time since opening the credit card in XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo now refuses to correct their error."

Wells Fargo & Company,"I purchased furniture through XXXX. It totaled XXXX. I was asked if I wanted 12 months financing at 0 % interest. I agreed. I made all payments on time. At the end of 12 months I had a balance. The Wells Fargo credit card did not bill me XXXX/month, which, when I calculate it, should have paid off the entire balance in 12 months. Instead they only billed me XXXX/month. Now I receive a bill for XXXX which includes interest of XXXX which is more than XXXX % of the balance. If I was informed at the time of purchase that the 0 % interest was deferred and that I had to make higher payments this past 12 months to pay off the balance in 12 months, I would have. There interest rate after 12 months is 28.24 %. I am now subjected to pay this full amount. I have a XXXX credit rating and could have paid this off in full to begin with and have several credits cards with lower interest. I was mislead by XXXX and Wells Fargo and believe that these fees are fraudulent. This should have been explained to me up front."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have had an on going problem with Wells Fargo Bank Credit Card Division regarding Payments. My payments are due on the XXXX of each month. Most months I pay my payments weeks early, due to budget issues. My XXXX payment was made on the XXXX of XXXX. At the XXXX of XXXX I received some inheritance money and made some extra payments to the account. on XXXX I paid {$2000.00}. On XXXX my credit card bill posted online and I paid the {$290.00} plus an additional {$250.00} for a total of XXXX. They posted the XXXX payment to XXXX rather than XXXX and charged me a late fee. they removed the late fee but have refused to adjust the account. I went into the bank and had a banker talk to the credit card office twice and have a third appoint for XXXX. My last appointment only brought frustration for me and the banker. The bankers agree that I am right and that my account should be adjusted. The credit card division has been nothing but rude and condescending.They keep saying that they no long correct their accounting errors. I had this same problem in XXXX and XXXX. I turned it over to the Consumer Protection people for resolution and they had the credit card division audit my account. they ended up refunding me over {$300.00} in late fees. Since I have made this same complaint twice they will not help me."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I received an email from my bank ( Wells Fargo ) telling me that I would be receiving a new credit card because my card "" may be at risk for unauthorized transactions. '' I called to ask what caused the bank to take this action. Someone at the Wells Fargo Fraud Department told me that there had been a financial data breach at one of the merchants I had done business with. I asked for the name of the business, but was told that "" XXXX does n't supply that information to us. '' He said that after the whole XXXX episode they do not disclose company names. How is this legal? Do n't I have a right to know who made my financial information vulnerable? 
Now I have to contact all the companies where I have automatic deductions to update my financial information. It would seem that XXXX, and possibly Wells Fargo, is n't interested in protecting consumers as much as it is in protecting the shoddy security of unnamed corporations."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Received letter from Wells Fargo thanking me for opening a credit card account with them. The letter also included a copy of my XXXX credit score.

Wells Fargo & Company,I contacted Wells Fargo bank regarding my credit card which is 2 months past due. I was trying to resolve this matter but was transferred 4 times. Once I located a person to speak with they informed they are located in XXXX and this guy was VERY RUDE!!! He wouldnt work with me at all. I tried to request a supervisor and he sent me back through automated recording. I explained to him why i was late on this bill. My grand daughter passed away on XXXX XXXX 2016 and had to be off work for a time period and the guy i spoke with informed me that was not a hardship. I dont understand how wells fargo can send their customers to XXXX and be told nothing can be done about the account except pay this off. I will involve an attorney if i need to and even notify other Wells Fargo customers that i know about what has happened to me.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I lost my job while I was in college and stopped paying on my Wells Fargo Credit Card. Once I found a stable job I called them to set up a payment arrangement that would end in the derogatory account being deleted from my credit report. I did this same process with another company that also agreed to delete the account but didnt. So, I set up this payment arrangement and paid for 6 months, Fast forward 4 months to now, they have acknowledged that I owe no more money on this debt, however it is still reflected on my Credit Report. It is super frustrating that months later after they took my money that they have drug their feet on rectifying the situation on my end. I am very unhappy since it was me who initiated this agreement only for it to not be honored on their end."
Wells Fargo & Company,I keep getting collection notices from Wells Fargo Bank for amount due at the time apprx {$11000.00}. I keep asking for signed receipts to see if I really owe the money. All I get back is according to our records I owe the money.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I signed up in 2014 for a secured credit card and placed {$1000.00} up for colleteral. At that time I was told I would be switched to a unsecured card after 12 months of good payment history.It is now been a little over 2 years and have n't seen any change in that status.I was also told after a banker called the credit card office that it is periodically reviewed.I feel I was lied to on several occasion, being the first, which has been I havent XXXX converted as well I dont see on any of my reports were I have been reviewed by wells fargo for consideration in the unsecured card.I have over outstanding payment history with my bank as a card holder and bank account owner as well.I do feel valued as a true customer and dont being lied too.I do understand they take other things in consideration upon review as well, but the main concern should be my good business with the bank.Why bother putting money into a bank and the bank isnt willing to take a small risk with me as a customer.My report will show I have not had any missed payments on any accounts over 5 years or so and will show a lot of inquiries which arent not mine, but I being penalized for them, not your fault, I do have XXXX open accounts in good standing and a lot closed in good standing as well as good personal loan payments and auto."
Wells Fargo & Company,I think wells fargo opened a credit card without my authorization.
Wells Fargo & Company,"Opened Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa Signature Card on XX/XX/2016. A balance transfer of {$13000.00} and a balance transfer fee of {$390.00} were posted to the account on XX/XX/2016. The following payments totaling {$1100.00} were applied to the account : XX/XX/2016 {$390.00}, XX/XX/2016, {$390.00}, XX/XX/2016 {$340.00}. The first statement was issued XX/XX/2016 showing a minimum payment due of {$520.00}, including {$390.00} to cover the balance transfer fee. When contacted Wells Fargo refused to apply prior payments to first minimum payment although they were made prior to the first payment due date. Their only solution was to return the funds which they had previously accepted, but returned funds would not be received from Wells Fargo prior to first payment due date. Wells Fargo has purposefully, and deceptively increased the first payment minimum payment without applying payments made to the account prior to the first payment due date, specifically for the purpose of encouraging default and increasing fees and interest rate."
Wells Fargo & Company,I have no idea how this showed up on my credit report because I have only authorized Wells Fargo to do a hard inquiry on my credit when I was applying for an Auto Loan.
Wells Fargo & Company,"For the most recent statement cycle of my credit card, after that cycle had closed, I received a new billing statement ( received XXXX/XXXX/16 ) from my bank stating that a new bill was due on XXXX/XXXX/16 in the amount of {$48.00}. On that same day after receiving the new statement, I promptly went online and paid my bill for the XXXX due date but it still stated that the payment was still due in XXXX. I was told by a representative that my payment was actually applied to the previous cycle and am not sure why that was since the previous cycle had closed and a new statement was generated. I argued with them to apply it to the XXXX payment but was told that when I made the payment it would not count as my payment for XXXX. I need them to fix this and need some confirmation from them that this will not affect my credit report or that this will occur again in the future."
Wells Fargo & Company,"In XXXX I opened a business checking account for a XXXX ; XXXX XXXX, XXXX. with Wells Fargo Bank. Afterwards the bank sent my business manager a credit card with his name and the name of the XXXX written on it. I was, at that time, a stockholder in the XXXX and my manager had made almost XXXX XXXX on a XXXX deal he was involved in- a one time thing. When he received the credit card he thought the bank was "" kissing XXXX '' and sent an unsolicited card because of the amount of money the XXXX had made. My manager lived XXXX hours away from me and makes all the decisions, ran the entire business and handled all the paperwork and dealt directly with the CPA. Later on the manager bought the business from me. The card was taking automatic payments from the business checking account I had set up and on XXXX XXXX went into the Wells Fargo branch in XXXX , CA and put a stop automatic payment withdrawal order on the checking account. He knew the market was tanking and knew his cash flow was going to be negatively affected and wanted to make sure there was enough money available to pay the monthly minimum due on the credit card. The teller who took the stop automatic payment withdrawal order was named XXXX and the reference number he gave the manager was XXXX. The manager made sure the order had been make effective immediately prior to leaving the bank as this was critical. XXXX assured him it was effective at that point. When he received the next bank statement he realized Wells Fargo bank had taken approx. XXXX XXXX dollars from the account which they no longer had the authorization to do. This was a breach of fiduciary duty the bank had to me and the XXXX. When the manager went to the bank to ask them about returning the money to the checking account they refused telling the manager that no one by the name of XXXX ever worked at the bank and that the reference numbers for the stop automatic withdrawals order given to the manager were meaningless! This action by the bank caused the manager a huge amount of damages trying to find funds to pay the monthly minimum on the credit card which he suffered until he could no longer pay the monthly minimum due and defaulted on payments at which point Wells Fargo Bank charged almost 30 % interest and penalties. On top of this Wells Fargo Bank forged my signature on a personal guaranty for the credit card and are now suing me for the balance due on the card. Wells Fargo sent my manager a redacted, illegible paper titled : '' Loan Application Wells Fargo Retail '' which has a signature on it which is supposed to be mine. The signature is misspelled with my first name being spelled "" XXXX '' and my name is spelled "" XXXX ''. Wells Fargo bank is stating this is a personal guaranty for the credit card. It also lists the amount "" requested '' as {$10000.00}. The credit amount Wells Fargo bank is stating in the card is {$45000.00}. This does n't make any sense. My manager has tried to talk with Wells Fargo and told them this is his and the company 's debt but they have refused to talk with him. He has offered to try and settle with them and they have refused. My manager admits to using the card even though the card was not requested. He never talked with me about the card as I had nothing to do with the business other than I owned stock in it so he did not know any details of the card origination or credit limits. He certainly never would have knowingly used a card with my personal guaranty on it and I would never sign or knowingly sign such a guaranty for any business. That signature is a forgery. I now have a lawsuit against me in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to which I and my former manager and subsequent owner of the company have filed a Cross-Complaint : Case number XXXX. Please help us. We are XXXX XXXX XXXX and not in good health."
Wells Fargo & Company,"My company opened a credit card with Wells Fargo at time of conception for myself, 100 % owner and guarantor of finances, and a signature only credit card for the secretary of the corporation, no ownership and no financial responsibility to the company. Being new to how a corporation credit card should be opened we believed it was done correctly. 
However when the secretary resigned I tried to close the credit card that was never activated and take him off the account to only be informed that he was placed as a guarantor of the corporation and the only way he could be removed is to payoff the card and open a new one. 
Was this fraud? Did the young man get paid for doing this? 
1 ) card was improperly opened 2 ) closing and reopening an established card causes a lot of issues to creditors and to my credit."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I set up a balance transfer from my XXXX credit card to my Wells Fargo credit card on XXXX/XXXX/2015 in the amount of {$7500.00}. The transfer was initiated through Wells Fargo, and they were to send the funds to my XXXX account. The balance appeared on my Wells Fargo bill very quickly, but has never been applied to my XXXX account. I 've talked to XXXX banks many times, but with no resolution. XXXX banks claim to have done multiple investigations to find the transaction from Wells Fargo to XXXX, and both claim to find no issue on their end. 

XXXX has informed me all they need from Wells Fargo is a transmittal report for the wire transfer ( which was described to me as a receipt for the transaction ). Wells Fargo says that they "" do n't do transmittal reports '' or any other type of confirmation, other than their internal tracking number ( which is useless to XXXX ). When I asked why they ca n't give me a receipt, I was informed that it is their information and they do n't have to share it with me. 

I 've been trying to get this resolved for more than a year. During this year I 've been having to pay XXXX bills, not to mention the additional interest on my XXXX credit card ( about {$1300.00} ). 

Since this balance transfer was initiated, I 've only been able to make the minimum payment on these XXXX credit cards, instead of being able to pay down XXXX credit card. As XXXX cards have been close to their limits during this time, this has negatively affected my credit score. 

Neither bank is willing to communicate with the other to get this issue resolved, and I do n't know how to proceed. 

See attached file "" XXXX '' for a summary of interactions I 've had with Wells Fargo and XXXX representatives in an effort to get the issue resolved."
Wells Fargo & Company,I called inquiring about service. Thought I was going to go with you. a few hours later I decided not too. You billed me today for services I do n't have .... {$73.00}
Wells Fargo & Company,"I am a victim of fraud by Wells Fargo Bank. My account ending in XXXX was supposed to be a Saving account and then it was turned to a credit card. The representative told me that it would be treated as a Saving Account. Instead I received a Master Card in the mail with a 15 percent APR. After reviewing the recent scandal with accounts, I am too a victim of fraud. My APR is now 25 percent and this is not what I initially was informed my {$5000.00} would be used for. I would like to be included in any lawsuit pending against Wells Fargo and I have closed this account. Additionally, Wells Fargo reps have violated Fair Credit and Reporting Law by negatively reporting this account late even though I disputed the debt. Additionally, they continued to contact me after I repeatedly told them not to contact me by telephone after reps were rude and disrespectful. I want this account off my credit report."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo sent me a letter telling me I was "" ..among a select group of valued customers receiving an automatic upgrade to the Wells Fargo Signature Card. '' It went on to explain that this "" upgrade '' would happen without any input from me, and listed "" benefits '' none of which were actually of any benefit whatsoever to me. In fact, there were changes in the fine print to the minimum payment calculation that would be detrimental to me under certain circumstances. I am complaining because 1 ) the claim that this is an "" upgrade '' is totally fraudulent ; 2 ) the change was made unilaterally- rather than asking me if I would be interested in the change, I was informed the change would be made automatically unless I made a phone call, costing me valuable time for no good reason."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I 've had a Wells Fargo Secured Credit Card for two years. I funded the account with {$800.00} from my Wells Fargo checking account. When I called Wells Fargo to close the account today ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ), I was informed that the outstanding account balance, {$600.00}, will be applied from the {$800.00} deposit. This I expected. However, I was informed that the balance refunded to me will not be given back to me for 45-60 days. In addition, until the amount was refunded to me, I will have to make payments or be charged late fees. Also, I was told that the account needs to have that long of period to refund the difference in case there were any transactions from merchants that Wells Fargo has agreements with so the amount could be charged to the account."
Wells Fargo & Company,"The idiots at Wells Fargo do n't know the definition of "" XXXX '' and their so called "" Senior Correspondence Specialist '' XXXX XXXX does not know how to address an issue that I raised in my previous complaint. Case number : XXXX All I am asking these XXXX is to send me their definition of a "" XXXX '' and they seem to be not able to do that. They ask me to prove that I am a XXXX when they have no understanding of who a XXXX is. And their so called response fails to address that at all. 

I am at a loss of words as to describe the level of stupidity I have encountered. Their response to a CFPB complaint is to repeat the same old stupidity without bothering to read the complaint and try to understand the issue at hand. 

These XXXX belong in a XXXX and not in charge of a bank. I will keep raising complaints till someone with at XXXX gets to take a look at it. Please keep these complaints on their record for others to see as well. 

thanks"
Wells Fargo & Company,"Requested increase in credit limit. The limits were approved without regard to income debt ratio. They approved debt without regard to whether it was feasible for me to pay back. Now I 'd like to move debt / consolidate to lower interest products and am unable to because all companies say my debt to income ration is too high. I 'm stuck with too high of a credit balance with an enormous amount of interest rate with no possibility of moving to lower interest products. It will take me 39 years to repay the credit balance if I continue to pay the minimum balance which includes high, ridiculous, and unfair amount of interest and fees."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I was contacted by phone in the XXXX, XXXX area ( phone number : XXXX ) by someone claiming to be a Wells Fargo representative regarding collecting a debt. They immediately asked my for my credit card number, so I hung up."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I opened a Secured Credit Card at Wells Fargo about 3-4 years ago. At the time, I was simply trying to re-establish my credit after a nasty divorce. A Personal Banker inside one of the local branches advised me to open a Secured Credit Card to help me in re-establishing myself. The Personal Banker explained that my own money would secure the credit card, allowing me to make purchases. He assured me that at some point, as early as 12 months or as late as 18 months, my credit card will become unsecured and my funds released back to me, and at that point I would have a normal credit card with even a possible credit limit increase. I am going on 4 years now I believe and each and every time I ask about my funds being released back to me, I am told that it is still under review. I called this afternoon to ask when I opened this credit card and I was told that they could n't release that information to me and that I would need to find my opening statement and look on there for it. I feel that this is just another bold face lie by Wells Fargo to tie up my {$1000.00} for this secured credit card while they obviously charge me interest on my purchases but I am not receiving any interest on the {$1000.00} that they are holding and refusing to return to me."
Wells Fargo & Company,"Good morning. 
I contacted Wells Fargo to get my interest rate lowered on my credit card. I 'm in the process of buying a home and I want to pay the debt down on my Wells Fargo credit card to raise my FICO score and lower my debt to income. I spoke with two reps and both said they were unable to lower the interest rate. I asked why and neither rep offered an explanation. Is there anything the CFPB can do?"
Wells Fargo & Company,I bought furniture at XXXX furniture that was delivered XXXX 2016 and was given 12 months zero interest. When I received the statement this month it has interest charges on it six months early.. I have my receipt showing that I was given 12 months zero interest.
Wells Fargo & Company,"Wells Fargo closed all of their accounts with XXXX XXXX. This left all customers with a negative line of credit and a reduction of credit score ( for me ) of XXXX points. This damage has, no doubt, cost XXXX people XXXX dollars in damage."
Wells Fargo & Company,"In XXXX 2016 was charged an over limit fee on XXXX of our business credit cards held with Wells Fargo. I spoke with someone directly at my branch asking if there was a way I can instead just have transactions declined instead of the over limit fee being automatically applied. I was told this was not an option. I have been charged {$39.00} for going over the limit a few times since, and after XXXX in XXXX I called to speak with someone and again was told there was no option to opt out of over limit fees. However, this is contradictory to information I have read on this site that states Consumers must "" opt in '' to over-limit fees. Those who opt out will have their transactions rejected if they exceed their credit limits, thus avoiding over-limit fees. I would like to know why Wells Fargo is NOT allowing for this option. ( They did refund the fee charged in XXXX ). So far this year, including the XXXX charge, this XXXX card has been charged {$190.00} for going over the limit, {$39.00} each time. I would also like to confirm that the fee can not exceed the amount that has actually gone over the limit, as also stated on this website."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I was a Wells Fargo customer with their Wells Fargo Visa XXXX which gave XXXX points per {$1.00} spent at drug stores and grocery stores. I bought prepaid cards as defined legally as "" XXXX '' by the CFPB. The T & Cs from Wells Fargo state we can not buy cash equivalents such as money orders or pre-paid gift cards. "" XXXX '' is explicitly defined as NOT a gift card by the CFPB. Furthermore, cash equivalents have a definition as well. Cash equivalents include all undeposited negotiable instruments ( such as checks ), bank drafts, money orders and certain certificates of deposit. Of which, a XXXX '' is none. 
I received a letter asking me to cease buying prepaid cards or they would shut down my account. I did so immediately but nonetheless they shut down my account and took all the rewards I had earned which totaled {$5000.00}. I contacted Wells Fargo 's XXXX office and complained that I had done exactly what they had asked but still they closed my account and took all my hard earned rewards where in the end I lost money. 
I get that they can terminate the relationship at any time, but they should n't be holding back rewards, as what I did was not in violation of the contract."
Wells Fargo & Company,"THIS IS SHORT STORY FOR THE 3 CALLS : called the Wellsfargo # on my cc monthly statement to pay the full balance because I wanted to close that out. The FIRST person I spoke to gave me the balance of {$1300.00}. ( it matched my statement ) I asked if I could have some help with the balance and for a settlement. Placed me on hold, then told me they would have to transfer me. The next department put me on hold a couple different times to come up with a settlement amount. The amount they came up with was {$1100.00}. The rep read me the disclosure they are required to read if paying less than the balance. I DID NOT agree because I had 2 questions. I asked if I would need a statement for the IRS and if I would end up paying the rest later with them and then if it would affect my credit in a negative way, he could n't answer the questions. I asked to be transferred to someone that could answer my? s, said they are n't trained to know those? s, referred me to the website, so I agreed to the full balance because I just wanted to take care of it and not have to deal with it or have it affect me later, because I had the funds. He said they would waive some late fees as a courtesy and offered me the amount of {$1200.00} to close the account. I agreed and wanted to give my card ( different bank ) to make the payment. He aggressively pushed me to use my WF acct. I told him I knew I did n't have the funds available in that acct. He told me he could check my balance. I told him I DID NOT WANT TO USE WF to pay this off, because I already knew there were n't enough funds there. He took all of my XXXX info, placed me on hold to process the pay off, told me he was n't authorized to processs the pymnt and then xferred me to a lady in CC services who quoted the same balance over a recorded line saying that when the {$1200.00} cleared ACH from my acct, it would be paid in full and I could close out and remove the acct from my profile. They could n't use a debit card, so I gave them my ACH info. The call to settle my debt lasted an hour and a half. I was xferred 4 different times. I got a statement a couple weeks later stating that I still owed {$110.00}. I called a branch banker, made an appt to meet. Spent another hour to settle it. They said they listened to the call, and needed 5-7 bus days to figure out what they could do. I called them XXXX/XXXX/2016. Was on the phone for 1 hr. 25 mins, xferred to 3 different people, and was told the balance given to me was confirmed in the phone call, but they could n't figure out why the rep gave me that and that no waiving fees was offered. ( I WAS ON THE CALL. I KNOW HE SAID THAT, I said I did n't want to settle and could pay the full amount, the rep gave me a lesser amount .... ), but there was no note of waiving fees, so what they could offer me was a reduction of fees accruing off of a balance that was existing after it should have been paid off, and still accruing fees while they figured out their error. The new balance was XXXX something. I asked the rep how they can continue to collect fees from customers when it should have been paid off, and they request time to figure out their error. He could n't answer my question. I agreed to pay the {$80.00} "" discounted '' close out for something that should have been considered paid off. I told him I would file with you. He gave me the exec office # to WF. Told him I would still file complaint because of their incompetent customer service, dishonesty and taking everything they can from loyal customers.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I ordered a XXXX Wells Fargo credit card for our daughter to use in case of emergency. 
The brochure with that XXXX credit card clearly stated that she could get a cash advance ( in case of emergency ).

Wells Fargo & Company,"I originally submitted a fraud claim with Wells Fargo bank in XXXX of 2016. Wells Fargo denied my claim because they said that I continued to pay my bill so the charge was valid. I had never heard of the company, and I pay my bills on time, so I let them know that I had never had any interaction with the company in question. The denied me again. After the second denial, I asked reached out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells Fargo responded and said that I should contact the company directly and when I have more evidence, that I should furnish them with it. I did contact the merchant who billed me via email. They told me that they did n't have any record of doing any business with me. I then sent this email thread to Wells Fargo so that they could correct my account. They did not. Wells Fargo has a {$0.00} fraud liability for clients, and this merchant has no record of doing business with me and I have no record of doing business with them."
Wells Fargo & Company,"On XX/XX/2016, while checking my accounts with Wells Fargo in relation to some other open issues, I found some unknown charges on my credit card. I called Wells Fargo to report these charges and work out the details of resolving this issue, but I was met with the same useless "" customer service '' people that have terrible attitudes, and generally refuse to do or be anything helpful."
Wells Fargo & Company,This is second time I received the same Wells Fargo Visa card which I never asked for. I refused to activate card when I called their number. Representative told me to call customer service and I did. They said the card has been active for four years regardless as its activated. They then said to destroy the card. I want to make sure I was never charged anything. They did say I had a XXXX balance. I never asked for this card. They did say this was some type of rewards card.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I received a call from an Indiana number XXXX at XXXX XXXX today XXXX XXXX, 2016. I heard an automated message saying something about my XXXX credit card eligibility for something, I do not remember what exactly, but I do not use credit cards so I knew the call was bogus. I followed the instructions to press XXXX to continue on. I was connected to a real person who proceeded with a script which I interrupted asking him how it was that they got my number because I do not use credit cards at which point the man on the other line promptly ended the call. I called the number back and the line beeped the way a disconnected line does. I regularly sign petitions concerning the environment and civil issues and I believe my identifying information has been thus compromised."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I signed up for a credit card through Wells Fargo, who I have been a long term member. Well. I have noticed that I have been charged around XXXX dollars per month again because approximately 5 years ago, I called XXXX XXXX and have talked to my local bank who tell me that I must contact XXXX XXXX myself as XXXX XXXX is a third party member not affiliated with the bank. they said at that time they will canceled but they added to my account again, because I never ask for that type of services, let me know if there is any way I can get refund for all this years they are been taking money from my account."
Wells Fargo & Company,"XX/XX/2016 I was the victim of credit card fraud. I was put into contact with a computer service company by XXXX after I could not access my email account. My password stopped working and my recovery email was long since deleted. The company ( who I did not get a name for ) offered to get me into my XXXX account and delete it, per my request, for {$99.00}. I paid them and gave them remote access of my computer. I watched them do some programing on my computer that I did not really understand, when they finished they claimed that my account was deleted and in a couple of days it would be gone forever. Two days later I get a call from the company and the man said that his name was XXXX XXXX which, based on his XXXX accent, was clearly not his real name. He said that they had used software on my computer that was against company regulation and they had to refund me the {$99.00}. I agreed and gave them remote access to my computer again. The man explained that they would wire the money into my account directly and all I had to do is log on to my Wells Fargo bank account. I agreed and logged on. He then explained that he had to darken my screen while he completed the transfer so that I would not see his bank 's routing numbers. I complied and when the screen came back up it showed that my account had an additional {$3100.00} in it. At this point the man put on a show, he claimed that he had made an awful mistake over refunding me and that if he did not fix it he would lose his job. I was a little suspicious but I looked at the balance of my other XXXX accounts ( savings, and credit card ) and they were correct. I felt bad for him and figured that I would not be able to keep the money anyway so I agreed to help him out. He asked be to wire {$2900.00} of the money to his associate, a man named XXXX XXXX in XXXX. He told me that the cost of the wire was only {$60.00} and I could keep the additional {$40.00} for my trouble. After work I went and wired the money. Throughout the process "" XXXX XXXX '' called me continuously expressing his gratitude and fear of losing his job. When the XXXX was done he thanked me excessively and offered to give me free computer service. The next day I received a call from a different man who informed me that the money did not go through because it was my first time wiring money and the amount was suspiciously large. He transferred me to XXXX and XXXX again had me give him access to my Wells Fargo account and he "" wired '' the money back into my account. When I saw the money was in my account I again went and wired the {$2900.00}. The next day I got another call from "" XXXX '' claiming that this wire also did not go through. At this point I realized that something must be really wrong. Over the past two days I continuously checked the balance of all three of my accounts and they all had the appropriate amounts ( which is why I agreed to send the money ). This time though, when I checked my account, my credit card had about {$7000.00} in charges that I did not make and had not seen. I looked at my history and figured out that they had fraudulently forwarded money from my credit card to my checking account via cash advances. The money they "" wired '' me was my own money. I did not notice the transactions because they took two days to post. Immediately I called Wells Fargo and explained the entire scam. I tried to call money gram and cancel the wire but it was too late. After filing my claim with Wells Fargo I had to get a new credit card, new checking account, and change all of my online information. I was instructed to wait 8-10 business days. I did not hear from them for two weeks so I called. They told me that I would not be refunded because I wired the money. I explained that the fraud was on my credit card and therefore XXXX % covered by the federal government. He claimed he could do nothing."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I recently opened a new credit card with Wells Fargo. I applied ( and was instantly approved ) for the card because they advertised a card that offered XXXX rewards points per dollars spent at gas stations, grocery stores and drug stores. As a father of XXXX children, I spend a lot in those merchant categories. I have a screen shot of the original offer as advertised. 

Shortly after receiving my card, I used it a few times and went to check out the rewards site to see what kinds of things I could use my points for in the future. I noticed that my card was only earning XXXX point per dollars spent, even at grocery stores and gas stations instead of the XXXX points per dollars it was supposed to be earning. I e-mailed to inquire and they said I had to call them instead for some reason. So I called, and they "" opened a case '' for me. A few days later I got a call back and the agent informed me that they would not honor the promotion as advertised. I argued for a few moments, pointing out that this was extraordinarily unethical, and probably not legally allowed. The agent did not deny that, but said there was nothing she could do in her position. 

That 's basically brings us to today. I applied, and was approved for a credit card that advertised a specific promotion. Wells fargo should honor the promotion as it was advertised. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter."

Wells Fargo & Company,Wells Fargo sent me a credit card with XXXX limit. Even though there is no interest on the money owed [ I transferred a balance from another account } until XXXX 2017 I have never been told what the interest rate will be.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a Wells Fargo Secured Credit Card, with a payment due the XXXX of every month. I paid my bill on the XXXX by transferring funds from my Wells Fargo Checking Account. I woke up the next day to find an account over-limit fee of XXXX added to my balance. This is not the first time this has happened. After calling customer service, I was told they attach a '' ghost fee '' ( which "" should '' fall off in 3 or 4 days ) to the bill even though it was paid on the due date and not late. There is no notification of any such fee in the card disclosures, and when I mentioned this to the customer service rep, she stated even though it is not the best, it 's just their policy. These fees have an impact on my credit report and credit score, because they are reported as me overextending my credit, even though I am not. Even if the fee falls off, they do not correct it with the credit reporting bureaus and I am stuck with a false, derogatory hit on my credit for 7-10 years. Ironically, if it was n't for the fact that Wells Fargo is in the news for deceiving some of their customers, I would n't have been looking as closely at my accounts, and would not have found about their practice."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a Wells Fargo Bank credit card for about XXXX years. I was reviewing my charges, when I notice a protection charge in case of unemployment.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I was given a credit card to finance my carpet purchase from XXXX XXXX, the card was from Wells Fargo. I was told it was zero interest. I reached out to Wells Fargo when a year later I got a credit charge for interest on the account for {$2700.00}. I filed a complaint that they ignored and said too bad for you. I was never provided documentation stating the credit charge would occur. Additionally, Wells is now charging me interest at a rate of 28.24 % on the interest charge. I have paid the the bulk of the original principal purchase off and now Wells is telling me I owe them another {$3000.00} and growing. I would like to pay off my principal balance and have them reverse the interest charges as I was not informed of the terms, they have not produced evidence and they are charging me an excessive rate of interest on top off an interest charge. I do not trust their sales practices based on recent events I feel they are trying to rail road me and deny me my rights as consumer."

Wells Fargo & Company,"As A Wells Fargo customer for 25 years, I was sent information for a pre-approved Wells Fargo Rewards Credit Card. So, I applied and was accepted. I wanted to take advantage of the benefits and consolidate some debt. 

I had the account for a few months, awaiting a decision on which other credit cards would be in my best interest to consolidate. I, then, received a letter from Wells Fargo stating they closed my account. I called customer service and the representative explained it was due to inactivity. I explained that I only had the account for a few months, but the decision was policy. 

I asked to speak to a supervisor and received the exact same answer, so because I have a good relationship with the bankers at my local branch, I decided to speak to them. 

I called my branch and spoke to XXXX and she was very helpful. She made an appointment with me to speak to a banker, in person, the following Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2016. 

When I arrived, we called the XXXX number, as I had done before, and the answers were still the same. So, the end result is : 1. Wells Fargo closed my account due to inactivity. When asked what the criteria or time-line was for closing an account, the representative stated their were many reasons for closing an account at anytime, but could not produce XXXX reason. 
2. By closing my account, this will affect my credit negatively, when I did nothing to warrant either my account to be closed or my credit to be affected. 
3. The representative said I could always re-apply, thus running a credit report and affecting my credit. I was already approved, Why should I have to re-apply? What gives Wells Fargo the right to negatively impact my credit, when I have been in compliance? 
4. Upon investigating my options from competitive banks, I will be withdrawing my funds immediately from Wells Fargo. After 25 years of service and commitment, I expect the same from my bank. 

The ONLY remedy I will expect from Wells Fargo is to re-activate my Wells Fargo Rewards Credit Card with a letter of apology and commitment to excellence to me and their customer base."
Wells Fargo & Company,"my wife received a "" home projects '' credit card in the mail from Wells Fargo.

Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a credit card with wells Fargo bank. I have been having a little trouble paying as have lost my husband as well as loss of income, but retained the debt of 2 people. Have written several letters asking for the opportunity of a discounted pay-off.Only to be told that they do not do anything in writing. I truly did not know that. So they proceeded to pull a dollar amount from my checking account.leaving it overdrawn and leaving me with overdraft fees. Only to inform me they did not charge it off expecting more XXXX"
Wells Fargo & Company,This is an very old debt that is still showing on my credit when the statue of limitations have past for over 7 years.
Wells Fargo & Company,Paid the amount agreed. Contacted the company they said I honored our agreement but the have XXXX to report this to the credit bureau.
Wells Fargo & Company,"I filed Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX 2010. My credits were notified electronicaly on XXXX XXXX 2010. Wells Fargo entered a illegal lien on my property on XXXX XXXX 2010, through XXXX XXXX XXXX. This account was discharged in XXXX 2010, but the lien remains against my property."
Wells Fargo & Company,"XXXX report dated XXXX/XXXX/2016 showed Wells Fargo Card Services, Credit Bureau Dispute Reso, XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX has requested XXXX separate inquiries for credit history. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX, current employee of Wells Fargo stated after the original inquiry for approval no additional credit inquiries are needed. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX, a current employee of Wells Fargo, was contacted. XXXX stated credit inquiry would be requested only once, unless the customer requests a credit increase. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX, a current employee of Wells Fargo, was contracted. XXXX stated the credit inquiries are ran just once. However, XXXX credit inquiries have been made to obtain copies of my credit history. 
According to the employees this is in direct violation to company policy. Wells Fargo is the third largest Bank in the United States and does not have employees running credit inquiries on a monthly basis for the large number of customers that they have. My account is in good condition, an credit increase has not been requested, and I am not involved in any type of debt resolution with Wells Fargo. It is my belief the inquiries are not being used for a work related reason. Therefore, I am requesting an investigation into what my credit history is actually being used for and who is this information being given to since the company does not have any use for the information."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I received an offer to take a cash advance against my Wells Fargo Credit Card for a promotional rate of 3.9 % for one year, in the amount of {$7500.00}. I also use this credit card for purchases, and I made {$5000.00} in purchases. I always pay off my purchases when the credit card bill comes in. So, when the bill came for {$12000.00}, I paid {$5000.00}, realizing that the interest on the {$7500.00} would go against an outstanding balance that interest would be charged against. To my surprise, Wells Fargo applied the entire {$5000.00} to the promotional balance, leaving the purchases unpaid, at an interest rate of 12.49 %. So, the upshot is that if you do n't use the credit card for ongoing purchases, you will probably get the promotional rate on the full amount of the cash advance for a year ( as advertised ). But, if you actively use the card, then the promo balance will be paid off in a few months, and you will owe a much higher rate on the purchases - which never got paid. None of the information about the promotion indicated that this is how payments would be applied. Wells Fargo did refund all the interest that I paid this month, but said I would need to call back every month and ask for the interest back - and they may or may not be willing to do this. Had I known that this was how they were going to apply the payments, I would have never used the promotion. I already had the {$7500.00} on a loan with a 6.5 % interest rate, so I am worse off now."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have been a member of Dillards card services for about 21 years and they were acquired awhile ago by Wells Fargo bank. Well I lost my job in XXXX and am just getting another job but I am paying my bills consistenly with the exception of a few months that I missed. My last payment of {$90.00} was paid on XXXX. which left my balance at {$80.00}. No high balance. However, I checked my credit card statement today to find out that Wells Fargo arbitrarily closed my account and when I called Dillard 's to inquire about their decision, I was told that they could not speak with me and I was hung up on. I thought that we lived in America! I never knew that a company/Bank would take this type of action without informing their loyal customers first. However, I can not to get any straight answers as to why this action has occurred. I called again and paid my past due amount because they could not answer any questions until that was done. In addition, no one could give me a manager 's name to provide you with. I was simply told that I was being transferred to the executive offices of Dillards and placed on an indefinite hold with me never having reached a manager to speak with. The teller told me that they had many managers on duty, so I wonder why was it so difficult to speak with a manager. This action was arbitrary and mean-spirited. Customers lose their jobs all the time in this economy, but are allowed to catch up their bills at a later time. I was in the process of doing so when my account was closed by Wells Fargo with no one supplying the name of who committed this action. Instead I am being assigned a case worker, XXXX XXXX and was told that he would be working on my case and would be getting back with me. I have never been so insulted in my life. I have treated like a deadbeat instead of loyal customer of 21 years. It saddens"
Wells Fargo & Company,"After making an electronic payment on my credit card which placed a positive balance in my favor on the card of {$140.00}, Wells Fargo informed me that while the payment for the card had been credited to my statement that the funds would be held for 15 days and my credit line would be unavailable until after the 15 day period. The {$140.00} balance in my favor would also be unavailable. The withholding of this portion of the payment is nonsensical to me considering the payment was an electronic payment."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I held the Wachovia Platinum Visa card for several years before mismanagement drove it to insolvency and the FDIC arranged its acquisition by Wells Fargo. A short while after I opened the card, Wachovia introduced a rewards program. Adding it to my account involved a simple change of account setting through my online profile. I did not have to apply for a new card. When Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia, it discontinued the rewards program without notice or explanation. A few months later, when I attempted to redeem the rewards which I thought had continued to accrue, I learned of the ending of the rewards program. Being aware that Wells Fargo had its own rewards Visa card, I visited my local branch to inquire. I was shocked to learn that Wells Fargo demanded that I apply for a new card event though they themselves had removed the rewards program which I had previously. 

When the acquisition originally was announced, Wells Fargo assured its customers that we would continue to receive the excellent service which we enjoyed under Wachovia. Shocked that Wells Fargo expected me to apply for a new card in order to restore the ability to earn rewards, I opted instead to desist in using the card, demoting it to use only in case of emergency. 

The card languished in this state for approximately 5 years. Then, earlier in 2016, I visited the same branch on other business and was informed by the teller that I was eligible for rewards on the same card. He encouraged me to accept the new program as the enrollment process was simple. Astonished, I immediately visited a customer service representative who explained that, yes, I could have THE SAME REWARDS PROGRAM which I originally had with Wachovia without applying for a new card. I merely had to consent to a change of setting on my card, which the representative conducted with my consent. 

A few weeks later, when my card expired and I received my automatic renewal, the new card clearly indicated its status as a rewards card. I felt a great sense of irony that the senior leadership of Wells Fargo needed 5 years to realize that the Wachovia program never should have been cancelled but accepted this new reality. 

My relief was short-lived when I learned that Wells Fargo had encouraged me to accept the new rewards program so that I would be confused and erroneously conclude that the newer, more, Cash Wise program was the same program as I had just accepted. Once I realized the deception, I examined the product 's terms and conditions on wf.com which made it clear that it was a separate product requiring an application. I applied and was denied. 

Concluding that an error had been made, I rang the reconsideration line and explained that I did not desire an additional credit line but rather a change in product. The operator suggested that I ask the Credit Card Services department for a product swap, which I would have done originally had I believed it to be an option. The Credit Card Services department denied my request because, under the bizarre manner in which the bank 's systems are programmed, it was a duplicate application, even though, supposedly, a product swap is not an application and would have retained the same credit line. 

As a final effort, I decided to visit the same branch which had encouraged me to accept the lesser rewards program. Before doing so, however, I applied for a credit line increase on my XXXX XXXX card, which was approved, clearly signaling that my creditworthiness was not at issue. 

I have been a Wells Fargo customer for so long that, when I opened my original account, it was with XXXX XXXX. The loyalty which I have demonstrated has been reciprocated with deliberate deception and profiteering because Wells Fargo seeks to minimize enrollments in its best rewards program in order to pad its profit margin."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I opened a charge account at Dillards and the account is managed by Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . I paid the very first statement in full by mail. Wells Fargo Bank failed to credit the account for the first payment. The second account statement arrived in today 's mail They are charging me a late fee of {$27.00}. I phoned them today and wrote them directing them to close the account. I ca n't believe how dishonest Wells Fargo is. I would like to know how many people they did this to. I can not possibly be the first. They have undoubtedly done this to thousands of other people."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I had a Wells Fargo credit card with a great Rewards Program. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 they sent me a letter, which I received on XXXX XXXX, 2016, saying I was overusing their rewards program- like making too many large purchases, and that if I did n't stop, they would close my account. I did stop immediately : I only made XXXX purchases after that, both for gas under {$20.00}. I could have withdrawn all my rewards in cash at that time, but I did n't, as I had been saving up for a trip for my family, and if I redeemed my rewards for travel, the points were worth XXXX % more. So I naively trusted their letter. On XXXX XXXX they sent me a follow up letter, forcing my account to be closed and seizing all of the value of all of the rewards that I had accrued, through purchases and through bonus sign-up offers. After I realized this, I called them on XXXX XXXX, from XXXX until XXXX, speaking with XXXX different people and many different departments. No one could help me get my money back. I never broke any terms or laws or rules. I complied with their terms to stop making large purchases on their card. In return they seized a cash value of {$1900.00}, or a value if redeemed for travel of {$2800.00}. This also adds a stain to my credit report."
Wells Fargo & Company,"On XXXX XXXX, 2012 a line of credit was opened in my name and within several days I received a Wells Fargo "" Platinum Card '' credit card in the mail with a line of credit shown to be {$5000.00}. I did not formally ( nor informally ) request an application for this card or apply for it. However, I did receive a "" cold '', unsolicited phone call from a Wells Fargo Representative either on, or several days before XXXX XXXX, 2012 during a time which I was at work. I answered the phone because it was a number I did not recognize, and explained to the representative that it was during the work day and therefore not a convenient time for me to talk. The Wells Fargo representative asked if he could "" send me some information ''. I told him that would be fine, and hung up the phone. Several days later I received a physical credit card in the mail with additional information about my new "" account '' which as I mentioned I had not applied for. I also noticed the new credit account show up as a new line item in my online banking interface, alongside my other Wells Fargo accounts ( at the time, only XXXX debit account and a savings account corresponding with the debit/checking account ). After receiving the physical credit card in the mail, it sat idle and I did not activate it until XXXX XXXX, 2012 ( due solely to the fact that I was planning an trip abroad later that month, and felt it would be helpful to have a line of credit to fall back on should any emergencies arise ) -- This credit card I received from Wells Fargo was my first generic "" credit card '', and prior to then my only credit card accounts were XXXX and XXXX XXXX branded cards, and an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( no line of credit, just a charge card ). All of that said, I have used the card since having activated it, but have always felt unsettled by the fact that I never requested it, and frankly was entirely baffled as to how this could have happened. After hearing about the recent allegations yesterday on the news outlining circumstances which sounded very similar, I wanted to share my story. At the very least, I take solace in knowing my experience was not an isolated issue. I plan to look into this further and obtain any other pertinent details ( for example, who exactly called me and why this occurred ). I would greatly appreciate any further clarification, potential resolution, or to be pointed in the direction of someone designated to assist with this particular situation. I am a resident of New Jersey, so if there are state resources I can contact I am happy to get in touch."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have had a credit card with Wells Fargo for several years. When I first got the card, I had a 9 % interest rate. The company raised my interest rate to 17.4 % currently, antold me that it was due to a late payment. I went back thru several years of payments and never found documentation of them receiving a payment late. I complained to the better business bureau, and all that occurred was that Wells Fargo sent a document stating that I was paying the higher rate with no proof of late payment. The balance of my credit card has been quite high over the past couple of years due to my involvement in a civil law suit that has cost more than {$20000.00} in attorney 's fees. Subsequently, I have been charged an inordinate amount of interest on this account and I did not agree to such a rate, nor did I pay Wells Fargo late, thus justifying their increased charges. I have documentation of my timely payments over the past couple of years as well as copies of my complaint to the XXXX. My credit rating is over XXXX and there is no record of my paying my credit card late on my credit report either. Thank you, XXXX XXXX"
Wells Fargo & Company,"I was hoping WELLS FARGO would have come its sense and realize that it 's calling ME, the card holder, the consumer and customer a liar. But in essence, knowing full well all the issue we had with identity theft and precautions we need to now take, and knowing full well WELLS FARGO made well over {$350.00} just in 3 months of over 12 months I had the card. I did not complain about the {$10.00} atm charge you charged me every time I used the card or your high interest rates. And I was never late once with my bill. Not to mention I can show with phone records and emails how many times I had to call in to WELLS FARGO to handle simple small issues over and over and over again. I can promise you as well over two hours a week was spent dealing with issues that I was told once I signed the forms would be handled. And they never did, they always came back. As well I also There were several disputes on the card that were active when WELLS FARGO closed the card down. And oddly the card just so happened to equal {$1000.00} which was my deposit. 

I have lost four times over with every company, not only not caring of my extreme identity theft issues, but taking advantage of our situation when we paid our bills and we stayed in contact with each company every issues doing whatever company policies were, but in the end, those things never mattered either. 

So, I let all those issues go, all those many many many issues. And I told you guys I was willing work with you, but you, again, WELLS FARGO has found a way to call the consumer who took the time to call right away when there was an issue on the card, a liar. So, I your customer, lied to you about the {$200.00} ATM dispute in XXXX. Cause what you told me was the MERCHANT saw me take the money of the machine. Well let me rectify this again for you, and I Will not discuss other disputes again, I am simply going go over this XXXX ATM at roughly XXXX at a convenient store located across from XXXX, next to XXXX XXXX -"
Wells Fargo & Company,"I lost my job and was trying to find a way to work with my bank considering my line of credit. I told them I had trouble paying the minimum payment. They told me they could n't help me if my account was current, and that in order to get help, I need to owe a payment. So I did that, and then they told me I could n't qualify to get a loan or to get help because I had a delinquency. Now I am stuck, and I still can not afford the payment. I have complained to customer service, and even went into a branch where the representative was given the run around by their own customer service. I was then told in so many words that I ca n't get help until I get out of a "" dead end job ''. As if I have n't tried! Then this same institution gave me an overdraft fee the same week that their exec got a ton of money after frauding people over products they did n't ask for."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I had gone into a Wells Fargo bank when I lived in XXXX XXXX California because I lost my Debit card, the teller had me meet with one of the managers at his desk, and they tried to talk me into a college credit card I told him I did n't want another credit card and no thank you I just needed a replacement debit card. Two weeks later I received a credit card and a debit card in the mail. I was so aggravated I worked XXXX jobs and was taking XXXX units in college I did n't have time to go to the bank or to sit on the phone right away to cancel the card. Within a couple of weeks I had a small overdraft and it went strait onto the credit card and at that point I knew this was going to show up on my credit report and I was trying to keep my revolving credit low. Since then I have been trying to pay this card off and close the account but it has cause me to have late payments and has just been a devstaing to my creidt and has blocked me from buying the home of my dreams.This card has been nothing but a headache affecting my ability to get a home, and a new car with a good rate this has been haunting me for a little while now. I had gone into the bank since then and told the teller and she stated I would have to call the bank. I was so shocked that someone could do this and they do n't even want to fire the guy, he was there at work that day I went in and pointed him out to the teller and all she said was to call. XXXX"
Wells Fargo & Company,Credit card was issued. Paid regularly for many years. I filed for bankruptcy XX/XX/2014 to prevent foreclosure. Bankruptcy was discharged within 30 days. Wells Fargo removed the credit card from the online banking portal and did not send any statements for 7-9 months. Wells Fargo wants remaining balance of credit card paid and continues to report as delinquent.

Wells Fargo & Company,"There is a fraudulent charge on my deceased husbands account. Even though at the time of the charge my husband was not well enough to even sign his own name, the financial institution is insisting this is a legitimate charge. They put me through a lengthy process to become authorized on the account and when I last spoke with the financial institution they told me they could still not help. I have received a letter in response to my last complaint telling me that I needed to call into fraud to report it, but when I did that as instructed they tried to transfer me to the probate department again and then hung up."
Wells Fargo & Company,"To Whom It May Concern : I am currently a 20 year old in my second year XXXX. I set up a credit card in my name last year along with assistance from my parents in order to establish a good line of credit for the future. I used it only for small transactions, always paid the bills on time, and had an excellent credit score within my first year of use. My parents, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, are lifelong users of Wells Fargo. I am currently in the process of appealing the decision that Wells Fargo made to deny my fraud claim of {$14000.00}, because they cited that because they could see that the chip was used and I claimed the card was in possession at that time, it obviously could not have been fraud. I am appealing for XXXX reasons : because there is a possibility that someone stole my card and was able to use it while I thought it was in my possession ; the bank is at fault for allowing a charge {$12000.00} over my {$1500.00} credit limit to be processed and failing to notify me of the charge ; and finally, because I have absolute proof that I was not anywhere near the town in which the charge occurred and have absolutely no idea how this has become my responsibility when it is obviously a fraudulent charge. 

XX/XX/XXXX I was completing a homestay and XXXX classes in XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I made a small trip to XXXX one day and had my items stolen from me, and while I initially filed in the police report that my credit card was in my bag and stolen, when I later checked I found my card amongst my things and believed that it had never been taken from me. However, I realize now this is a possible explanation, if someone was able to duplicate the card and somehow return it to me. 

While I am not sure if someone stole my card or not I believe that there could have been a period of time when the card was out of my possession. After my trip to XXXX, I returned to XXXX XXXX and stayed in a hostel in XXXX XXXX la XXXX on XXXX XXXX, the same day that the fraudulent charge occurred on my card in a city over 6 hours away. I have a receipt from the hostel I stayed at proving that I used the same credit card at this hostel that was charged the {$14000.00} on the exact same day in a town I have never heard of, over 6 hours away from me. 

I was not even notified by Wells Fargo of the obscene amount of money being charged to my card. It was not even indicated that the charge put me over my credit limit, which is only {$1500.00}. The morning that I discovered the charge was when I logged onto my bank account and saw the {$14000.00}. I had only a few minutes to call and report the fraud before a tour booked that morning, and no one was able to tell me why this charge was allowed to go through and why my card was n't cancelled. I told the fraud claim department that I had the card in my possession and did not notify them at the time that it could have been potentially stolen, because I did n't see the information necessary when I had the card with me. At the time, I did not think that someone had physically taken my card since I regained possession of it mysteriously, so that is why I did not notify my bank of my items being stolen, believing that it was in my possession the whole time. 

This charge was at a supermarket in XXXX that I have never stepped foot in nor heard of before. It would be literally impossible to charge this amount to the card through a regular purchase of items, and I have absolutely no idea how the supermarket itself was able to put this charge through or how the person committing the theft would have gotten the money in the first place, since it is impossible that the store had that much cash on hand. This is obviously the work of someone who knows what they 're doing and not my own doing of a XXXX year old XXXX in XXXX who barely speaks the language."
Wells Fargo & Company,"I have a lot of experience with promotional interest rates and leverage these when possible. Wells Fargo 's credit card statement is extremely confusing and it was unclear how much needed to be paid and when to avoid interest rate. I had XXXX different promotional balances and the "" warning '' that XXXX were expiring is on page XXXX within XXXX of XXXX boxes of information in regular font and very easily missed. As soon as I noticed I was incurring interest, I called. Even with the bills in front of me and them walking me through each piece, it is confusing when you have multiple promotions. There should be something on page XXXX near where your payment information is to highlight what is needed - full payment of the promotional amounts PLUS the minimum payment. I asked for consideration for the interest that was accrued in the 45 days it took me to notice this error and was not accommodated. I have exceptional credit and this credit card and a mortgage with Wells Fargo. I have never been this confused by promotional periods and have personal policy not to incur interest outside my mortgage. It feels like Wells Fargo does this intentionally to trip up customers and get the interest payments."

Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I had made a deposit of {$55.00} at the Capital One Bank in XXXX, Md to my credit card ending in XXXX. When I returned home to check my account, my online account was restricted. I had called Capital One and they requested for me to go to the branch Capital One bank to verify my identity. I went to the bank XXXX mins after the call and done what was requested. Prior before leaving I was told that my account will be back up and running and to not worry about anything. I have repeatedly call for XXXX weeks asking what has happened to my account for them to close it. I have talked to the Capital One Fraud Supervisor who could not tell me why they close my account. They have sent me no notice of intent to close, fraud or anything of that nature. Nobody can give me an answer of why my account is restricted. It is fishy to me that my account went closed after I made a cash deposit in the bank. I am applying for mortgage next month and due to my account being restricted or closed, I can not pay down my balance to lower my utilization rate. The Fraud Supervisor told me I could still make payments but when I went to pay down on it the branch tellers told me I could n't because the account was closed due to Fraud. I am worried about my credit score and can not get any answers from no Supervisors of Capital One. All they keep saying is my account is under investigation for Fraud but they have found no Fraud on my end. So I keep asking why do my credit score has to suffer because of something they are messing up on. They can not give me a clear answer.

XXXX the other XXXX cards, I was able to pay them off in full. I called in to Capital One and made the payments over the phone. 
A few days later, I went online to check that the accounts reflected the new balance and found that each XXXX had a note that say the accounts had been suspended. 
I called in to Capital One to ask what this meant and they said that I could no longer use the accounts but they would remain open and I would still get a yearly charge for them but I could not use them again. 
They did not inform me when they took my money, nearly {$1000.00}, that I would not be able to use the cards anymore.

They refuse to respond in writing, and only respond via online secure messaging trying to get me to call in. I asked for the matter to be escalated to the corporate office for written response, and instead, someone left a voicemail message. I am NOT calling them back. I have the legal right to insist all communications with banks and credit card companies be in writing via online secure messaging. So then, I went online to activate the new XXXX card, and they 've blocked it, as I 've received an account restricted message. I 've already warned them that I would file a CFPB complaint if they continue to fail to respond in writing, but now that they 've restricted my new XXXX account, I 'm filing this complaint, as clearly, that is an act of retaliation. If CFPB fails to appropriately address this matter, and instead, simply sends me Capital One 's response, then considers the matter closed, I will report this to my Congressman, as well as post it on the Internet, as clearly, that indicates CFPB is just a "" dummy '' agency created for the sole purpose of keeping the OCC from having to handle consumer complaints.

Capital One,"I applied for a Capital One Venture Card. The disclosure notice stated that the Annual Percentage Rates ( APR ) are 12.9 %, 17.9 % or 22.9 % depending on one 's credit worthiness. I was surprised that I was assigned the 17.9 % APR upon approval and after Capital One ran my credit through XXXX. I had a recent XXXX credit score of XXXX, generally considered excellent. After seeing the rate Capital One provided me I immediately ran a credit check through Experian and I found no potential negatives on my credit report with all accounts are in good standing. I XXXX attempted to inquire with Capital One as to why I would not receive the better rate, and they said that I had agreed to the terms offered, that I should read the terms and they could not provide me any further assistance. In fact, I believe their application provides a range of APR 's until the applicant submits the application and then the applicant discovers what rate Capital One has granted the applicant. It is quite possible that Capital One has a standard that I did not reach with regard to credit worthiness. Unfortunately, I can not help but wonder who does qualify for the lower rate they advertise. With excellent credit, I would like to know why I did not qualify for the lower rate. If Capital One has a very narrow qualifying criteria for the lower rate, they should disclose what score is necessary to obtain the low rate or not advertise the lower rate. Generally, I believe Capital One should also be more transparent and forthcoming with what their standards are for interest rates for applicants.

I noticed the recent statement had a larger payment due than normal and indicated the account was past due. I called Capitol one and they said they received and posted a payment before the XXXX day of the month the payment was due therefore they were applied to the previous months cycle and caused the account to become past due.

Capital One,"I opened a secured credit card with Orchard Bank, and deposited {$500.00} in doing so. The account was later consolidated into HSBC and then again into Capital One. I closed the account today and spoke with a representative afterwards to request return of the {$500.00} security deposit. I was told they show the account as unsecured and that the funds should have been returned to me prior. I was then told to call some other number ( turned out to be a voicemail for lady at a small community bank, with no apparent connection ). I am seeking help for the return of my {$500.00} security deposit.

Capital One,"I recently requested a {$6000.00} courtesy check from Capital One to use the 0 % 12 month APR to finance a central air conditioner repair. I was aware of the XXXX % fee and was comfortable with the fee. I received the statement listing the "" Balance Transfer '' on my statement ; however, only an amount of {$2100.00} was listed in the 0.00 % Special Interest section of my statement. I "" overpaid '' the monthly charges by taking the New Balance, which included the fee, and subracting the {$6000.00} and then adding an extra {$500.00} to the payment to start chipping away at the {$6000.00}. I received my latest statement and was shocked when I saw interest charges totalling {$15.00} on my bill and the 0.00 % section on my statement now listed {$6000.00}. I called Capital One directly to understand what happened. I spoke with a respresentative for over 45 minutes while she tried to figure out what happened. She placed me on hold several times so she could speak to her manager to get a better understanding. With each explanation I could state, based on what she told me, I still should not have to pay interest. At first she stated my payment went to the lowest interest rate balance first, which I stated is very unfair and deceptive as payments should be made to the highest interest rate balance first. I eventually asked to speak with her manager after she wanted to speak with him for either a third or fourth time. The supervisor came on ( expected a manager ) and he stated the grace period was waived once I requested the courtesy check and I would have to make a payment of all charges, even after the statement date, to forego interest charges. I would like to point out with this explanation, I would have to access my account online and then overpay that amount to guess what my upcoming charges may be so I do n't have to pay interest on any charges. I find the fact the initial representative could not explain to me what happend on my bill to support my claim of unfair and deceptive marketing and practices by Capital One. The supervisor did tell me I was told these terms when I requested my courtesy check and I informed him I had to ask the representative to slow down and repeat herself on several occassions and then I recapped the terms to make sure I fully understood what I was getting into. I did not recall the waiving of a grace period for charges. The supervisor stated he would review the call and get back to me no sooner than this Wednesday since he would be off the next few days. I called into Capital One on a Saturday afternoon ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I am expecting a call this Wednesday to hopefully put this matter to a close. I was on the phone with Capital One for over an hour and the item is still not closed. Depending on how this issue is resolved, I may end up paying more in interest which in effect turns the 0.00 % APR into 12.90 % APR, plus the XXXX % fee.

Capital One,"I received XXXX letters from CapitalOne on XXXX XXXX, 2015. XXXX letter stated that I would be receiving a CapitalOne Credit Card with a credit limit of {$10000.00} within a couple of weeks. I did not solicit a credit card from CapitalOne. The XXXX letter contained the credit card. 
The following day I received a message to call the fraud detection department at CapitalOne because there had been unauthorized use of the card by the second person named on the card in XXXX -- -I live in XXXX XXXX The credit card I received had only my name on the card. I was also told that the card had been cancelled and that I would not be responsible for the several small charges made to the card. I persisted and got the name of the second person and the XXXX charges made in XXXX. The number I received reached the CapitalOne fraud department in XXXX. I asked for a number in the USA. The XXXX number I called reached their fraud department in XXXX XXXX. The XXXX number that I was given reached offices in XXXX. The helpful clerk in XXXX provided the information concerning the second person named on the account and the XXXX small charges made before the account was closed. This clerk would not name the city where she was located in Oregon but by asking questions It was narrowed to either XXXX or XXXX. 

It is beyond my comprehension that a multi-national credit card company would send an unsolicited card with a ready limit of {$10000.00} that could be activated by someone other than the named party printed on the card. My attorney is looking into possible action against CapitalOne for their unethical business practices. I will abide by his recommendation. 
"
Capital One,"I paid off my Capital One credit card years ago. I just never closed the account because I thought it would look better on my credit report to have a zero balance than a closed card. When my new card arrived after the old one expired it had a sticker on it with directions to call for activation. I kept this sticker attached and never called. I filed the card away in a safe place. Years go by and I forget I even have/had this account. Suddenly in XX/XX/XXXX I get alerts that the card is being used. Immediately I call Capital One. I get nothing but the run around. No hassle card?? This is anything but. I pull out the card to reference it & the valid dates are XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. Keep in mind this card was never used, the account inactive since XX/XX/XXXX. This card was NEVER activated. After several calls they send me what looks like a novel in the mail with with a ton of paperwork to fill out about the charges. Then I have to check off each & every charge that I claim is fraudulent. That 's EVERY charge!!! Pages & pages of them. I fax the many pages to them. Get another past due bill in the mail. More calls made. Turns out after all this they did n't close the account or flag it?! How does someone continue to make purchases, does this bank have any common sense? Call again & order the account to be closed. Finally get a notice on the mail everything is resolved. Two weeks later another bill for past due amounts. I call again. Apparently only some of the charges were resolved as fraudulent, not the later charges. This is going on 5 months now. What a joke. Honestly feeling like this bank is nothing but a giant scam. This particular card has an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX. Is this a coincidence that after years of inactivity just months before the account expires again there 's hundreds and hundreds of dollars charged? Some that required a currency exchange so obviously out of the country? I 've never even been out of the country. Either the company itself is a giant scam or employees are stealing the information. No other way anyone would have had access to the account, it was n't even an active account. Not only would I never recommend anyone ever do business with this bank, I highly recommend closing accounts if you have them & do n't let anyone you know use this company for any type of loans or credit cards. Still not a resolved issue, I could n't be more annoyed or frustrated. Do n't walk away from this bank. Run. I 'm actually nervous they have my information in their system, I do n't trust them one bit.

Capital One,"I had a credit card with Captial One that I failed to pay the balance on. I originally defaulted on it XX/XX/XXXX. I made no payments on the account until XX/XX/XXXX. I paid XXXX dollars on a XXXX dollar minimum balance. The account was never brought current. Capital One shows my date of original delinquency to be XX/XX/XXXX when it should be XXXX of XXXX. I have called and spoke to several representatives about this. I was told today that they re-aged my account when I paid the XX/XX/XXXX payment of XXXX dollars. They did not have my permission to do so, nor did we set up any kind of payment plan or agreement. When I asked them why they re-aged the account, I was told that although they could see the payment history they had no notes about why the account was re-aged. I am requesting that they change the date of original delinquency back to XX/XX/XXXX which means it should have fallen off of my credit report last month.

Capital One,"XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXCapital One XXXXFor more than XXXX years I have tried to verify the above mentioned accounts via certified letters and phone correspondence. 

According to my records, each account has been reported separately, and simultaneously, to the credit bureaus under both creditor names : Capital One and XXXX XXXX. 


My efforts to verify these accounts are complicated by the following facts : Capital One and XXXX appear to report these alleged debts using different account numbers. 
Alleged amounts owed on these accounts, have been in close proximation, but never exact. 
XXXX does not respond to my requests. It appears Capital One responds to inquiries for both companies. 
Capital One uses the last XXXX digits of the alleged account number in correspondence, yet credit reports reflect what appear to be beginning numbers. 
Despite the fact that I sent a copy of my SS card and driver 's license with my inquires to Capital One, their company responded with asking me to verify my own information. 
Despite the fact I stated I had no knowledge or records of the accounts in my request for verification letters, and that I suspected fraud, Capital One responded asking me to provide them with the account numbers. 
XXXX ( Case # XXXX ), ( XXXX - Case # XXXX ) and XXXX ( File # XXXX ) claim to have verified these accounts - but have never provided me with proof. 
I have never been sent collection letters from XXXX or Capital One. 

I highly suspect the above mentioned accounts, are accounts Capital One previously removed from my credit reports, and are now reporting the same again. 

It does appear the XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts did not belong to me. I filed a Chapter XXXX 100 % creditor payout in XXXX of 2012. Through this process, a hearing was held on multiple creditor claims. This hearing assisted with confirming numerous accounts were fraudulent or unverifiable. Without ordering an expensive transcript of the hearing, I can not share if these accounts were fraudulent or unverifiable. 

It should be noted, Capital One nor XXXX attempted to place a claim during the bankruptcy process. Please find attached a claim summary prepared by the Chapter XXXX trustee. 

Only XXXX response letter, from Capital One, claims XXXX XXXX XXXX was sold to another company, XXXX XXXX XXXX . 

Yet it was XXXX XXXX who placed, and was denied a claim, during the bankruptcy process for this account. 

Regardless, all XXXX accounts remain on my credit report, and I remain confident they do not belong to me. 

Please seek proper documentation on each account under FCRA and FDCP rules for collection and reporting. 

Please seek immediate removal of each account if the creditors can not provide said verification.

I immediately saw that my card was showing past due and I called Capital One to see what I should do. They said that I should work it out with XXXX XXXX XXXX first before filing a dispute with Capital One. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX about the unauthorized charge. They apologized for the charge and agreed to refund the full amount back to my card. They refunded the full {$38.00} on XX/XX/2015. I called Capital One back and they said they would take care of the late charges and interest. They also said I would n't be reported late to the credit bureau. I happened to notice my credit score dropped around XXXX points. Capital One did report me for being XXXX days late for an unauthorized charge made to my account.

How dare you treat me that way and then have the audacity to charge me an additional payment forcefully so I would avoid having a ding on my credit report.

She said that my account is restricted and under investigation, she asked me to submit some documents and that she will email me a link where i can upload those documents that she mentioned. after a day or XXXX i submitted the documents, then i waited for days then weeks then i got worried because XXXX XXXX is near and i do n't want to pay it until i know what is going on with the investigation and i do n't want to pay the late fee either. So i called and spoke to a man this time and explained that i submitted some documents that the customer service asked me to but never got any response, and i told him that i wo n't pay the amount until i get the result of the investigation he put me on hold for awhile and after awhile he said that he ca n't access my account because it is closed already, and i asked him how about my up and coming payment due? do i have to pay it or just wait? and he said just do n't have to worry about it. So i said ok, then still waited and waited for a call from them but never did received any call then XXXX XXXX came i was really worried that i will really be hit with the late fee and of course i checked after 2 days now i m charged with {$35.00} for the late fee and now asked to pay {$130.00} coming XXXX XXXX, 2015. Still never got any calls from capital one, so i called and explained to them what happened, i was put on hold for a long time and then explained again what had happened to the other person.

The person then told me that somebody else is taking care or in charge of my account but not working on that day, she then told me that she will let that person call me the following day and i said ok but please do make sure that he/she calls me i just want this to be over.

I did not apply for a Capital One card at any time.  (This is why I have credit freezes.)  Although there was only a mailing address on the refusal notice, written advertising materials included a number to call (XXXX).   A call to that number was answered with a menu option. There was no option to request an agent, even though I asked repeatedly. When I tried to call back several times, I got only a ""number not in service"" message. After about XXXX minutes, I called the back, used a different menu option (new card) to get a live agent. When I asked for the fraud department, agent XXXX (sp?) put me on hold, then said XXXX would talk with me.  However, the call then disconnected.    When I call back later, I got only the  a message that the ""office is closed until XXXX tomorrow.""  I then went to website for reporting Capital One fraud and called that number.  A woman with heavy XXXX accent answered and said they could not investigate without having my SSN.  When I refused to give that, she then consulted with someone else and came back saying I would need to submit copies of my credit reports in order to have an investigation.  This seemed fishy to me since there was no way to verify that it was a legitimate site.  I disconnected, telling her that I would be reporting the incident to the authorities.  On the call to reach a live agent, I did have to give my name and address in order to reach an agent but gave only this public information.
In the same week, I received a similar message from XXXX and this morning had a phone message about the application with instructions to call XXXX.  I did have to give name and address to them; they did not request any other information and said they would send letter confirming the cancellation.

Once the debt collector realized i was n't going to secure the payment right then she stated that settlement was no longer an option and i could n't mail in the settlement then i became no longer eligible for a settlement at that point she started to violate FDCPA and UDAP for unfair business practices. I also told them numerous amount of times to stop calling the telephone they had on a recorded line they kept continuing to call the cell phone number multiple times and multiple times a day, throughout the course of several months. At this point i am filing a complaint and going to explore further options.

Capital One,"I called Capital One Mastercard on about XXXX/XXXX/2015 to request an interest rate reduction and spoke with XXXX ( ID # XXXX ). Shortly thereafter, I received notification that our mailing address was changed. This was performed without our consent by "" XXXX '' and after confirming with Capital One, our address in fact had stayed identical. 

As a result, their website refused to accommodate my request for a payment due date change, making it impossible for me to extend the due date of my {$4700.00} balance, because the statement closed the day after I attempted to do so online. 

Despite this egregious error, Capital One refused to correct the error and enable the date change on the website. Furthermore, they refused to extend the due date on my ~ {$4700.00} balance.

Capital One,"Hello, I had a credit card with Union Plus. Union Plus was purchased by Capital One. I missed a few payments because I was out on maternity leave and never really got caught up. I tried to get on a payment plan but there was not XXXX available for my financial situation. My account was charged-off by Capital One but they did not ever put my account in their Collection Department or Recoveries Department and both exist. I believe put my account their because it was not an original debt with Capital One.

Capital One,"I am a victim of identity theft and someone stole my personal information and opened up XXXX credit card accounts with Capital One Bank. I never applied for a credit card with Capital One Bank. The XXXX credit accounts are unauthorized, fraudulent and do not belong to me. I have sent numerous letters, police reports and copies of my Minnesota drivers license and social security card to Capital One Bank and have informed Capital One Bank about this matter numerous times. The following accounts ending in : XXXX and XXXX, do not belong to me. I will not send any further correspondence to or communicate with Capital One XXXX.

Capital One,"This matter deals with Capital One 's practices concerning automatic payment enrollment for their credit cards, which I believe violates the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and its accompanying regulation B, general fair lending principles, the Consumer Financial Protection Act 's prohibition on unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, FTC Section 5, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud Protection Act. 

As you can see from the class action I am prepared to file, attached to this letter, Capital One has told me a number of times that it restricts its enrollment in automatic payments to online only. Because of this restrictive practice, Cardholders who do not have internet access, or who can not or do not want to register for online activity, are deprived of the ability to make automatic payments. Cardholders who do not sign up for automatic payments are more likely to forget to make a payment, thereby incurring late fees and additional interest charges. Capital One in fact charges late fees when Cardholders do not make timely payments, and reports those late fees as part of the Cardholder 's balance to the major credit reporting agencies. I myself have incurred late fees and additional interest charges several times due to the fact that Capital One will not allow me to enroll in automatic payments via telephone. 

Capital One reports Cardholder balances to the XXXX major credit reporting agencies, inclusive of the late fees and additional interest charges incurred because they are unable to enroll in automatic payments. Cardholders who do not have internet access, or have limited access, or who prefer not to engage in online activity are disadvantaged by Capital One 's practice of limiting enrollment in automatic payments to online only, or alternatively, are disadvantaged by Capital One 's practice of misleading Cardholders into thinking that they can not enroll in automatic payments via telephone. 

As you know, Cardholders who do not have internet access, or have limited access, or who prefer not to engage in online activity are more likely to be elderly, lower income, minorities or active military. I believe Capital One 's practice of restricting automatic payments to online access only has a discriminatory effect on members of protected classes under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 

To the extent Capital One does allow telephone enrollment in automatic payments, its practice of telling Cardholders that enrollment is limited to internet only is false, misleading, and designed to force Cardholders to incur late fees and additional interest charges, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act and Section 5. 
"
Capital One,"Capital One changed the interest rate on my credit card account from 0 % to 12.90 % APR without any notification that this change was taking place. As a result, I had no time to remit payment in full on my account prior to the interest charges beginning to accrue.

Capital One,"My sister and I both have applied for the same credit card which was the XXXX card by Capital One. Neither of us have yet to receive denial letters via mail, my application was almost 30 days ago. However instead both of us have received emails regarding our denial letters. We enter the credentials which were our XXXX and XXXX. When we entered the credentials we noticed it was someone else denial letter. Completely different name and everything. This is a privacy issue especially considering we both got someone else 's denial letter.

Capital One,"I have been an excellent Capital One multiple credit card account holder customer for many years and I have always conducted the best of what is expected as a client with this bank and handled my accounts always in a positive and excellent manner of operations but I am contacting and filing a complaint against Capital One after I have notified and tried to resolve my issue with them for quite some time. I have asked for a credit limit increase on my accounts and they will not grant me my requests month after month and has been close to XXXX years or longer on some of my accounts. They send me a reply back explaining why and the reasons are not justified. I will enclose proper documentation as well with this complaint. I have never been late on my accounts and I have never been over the credit line or missed any payments. I have used my accounts a lot and I pay them on time as well sometimes even several weeks ahead of payment due date and frequently more than once in the same billing period and I have made well above the minimum payments that their last denial of credit line increase saids I was n't making the more than the minimum and yet I can show that as well is incorrect. I feel like I am being discriminated with Capital One on not getting the same services that other good account holders have access to. I show excellent responsibilities on my accounts that should warrant no denial for credit line increases and additional spending power that I should be entitled to as the next person. I have XXXX account with them and XXXX of the XXXX are paid in FULL and have XXXX balances since XXXX 2014 and they still decline credit limit increases on these accounts as well. They have no real excuses but send me bogus if not random computer generated responses that show no merits to what they declined me for and if not at least being discriminated then perhaps a huge error in their approval for such request should be noticed and investigated into. I have all supporting documentation to show my concerns here and I have even contacted Capital One about this issue several times and they seem to over look and or not seem concerned about my complaints and questions. The last complaint was about a week ago and they said their RESOLUTIONS DEPARTMENT would call me and of course this proved to be false and I never heard anything back from Capital One as they said I would in XXXX business days of initial complaint filed. Capital One should not be allowed to treat me differently for whatever their criteria is if they are not following the same business practices with everyone else that is holding the same standards of account responsibilities and should not be allowed to pick and choose who is entitled to privy rewards and who is n't when regardless that both parties take good accountabilities on their credit card accounts. My status is excellent with the way I handle my accounts and they do not have any real reasons NOT to grant my requests when I ask for them. They send me their reasons to why I was not approved by these reasons can be justified and proven that it is n't so. This is not right and should not be tolerated from a business that can not be diligently fair and reasonable with every account holder with fairness and unbiased and non discriminatory when making decisions and should be viable and legitimate reasons for declined of such asked requests when requested by an account holder such as myself. Telling me that I was denied due to low monthly payments on my account when their minimum is {$45.00} and I am making {$160.00} payment does n't not see too low minimum payments and I always pay at least XXXX the asking monthly set Capital One billing in addition even with XXXX accounts paid in full they still do n't have a valid reason for not granting my request. This needs to stop and be investigated at once. Thank You

Capital One,"Capital One received a {$1500.00} direct expedited electronic payment from me on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and immediately placed a fraud hold on my account, I called in when my newly paid off card was declined. From here a 2 day nightmare began where they forced me to conference call every financial institution I have done business with in the past and currently including banks I have never made payments to C1 from. They threatened me with legal action, accused me of criminal acts and withheld my funds. They forced me to provide them with private account numbers and details that do not in anyway pertain to them or my account. As I had just put such a large amount of money towards that account I felt I had no option but to submit and do what I was told. As soon as I provided them with a piece of information or called a bank lwith them and listened to them tell my financial institutions I am suspected of fraudulent activity they would disconnect the call and I was forced to begin the entire process again while I listened to the other agents laughing in the background. As a result of this pointless investigation I have had to deal with fraud holds and account closings caused by their inquiries. worst of all this is not the first time ... C1 is constantly witholding my funds, contacting my other institutions without my permission and with no logical reason ... Im not even sure how they know I do business with the others.

Household Bank ( HB ) eventually refunded the XXXX hot spot charges but not the month of service until I agreed to cancel my current credit card and let them send me a new XXXX. I agreed to do that and after I got the new credit card and cancelled the old XXXX, they would not refund the bogus {$52.00}. service charge. I tried for month to get them to make it right but they would n't. I was still haggling with HB when Capital One bought out Household Bank and I had to dispute it with Capital One. They saw it was bogus and said it was refunded on my card, which it was. That was the only reason I used Capital One 's card. Otherwise I would have closed that account for getting bad service.

"
Capital One,"I have a CapitalOne "" World '' Mastercard, which has a cashback bonus program. I always pay the balance in full each month by using CapitalOne 's website to schedule a withdrawal from my checking account, to occur on the due date. To make my most recent payment, I redeemed most of my accumulated cashback bonus for an account credit, and ( as I normally do ) used CapitalOne 's website to schedule a withdrawal from my checking account, setting the amount to the difference between the balance due and the cashback credit amount. After the due date, I got an email from CapitalOne saying they were charging me roughly {$10.00} in interest. I called them to find out why, and the representative told me that CapitalOne does not count credits ( including both cashback bonus amounts and refunds from merchants ) as "" payments '', and so they do n't reduce the amount you owe for a prior statement period. Instead, CapitalOne nets such "" credits '' against the purchases you make during the statement period in which they occur, reducing the amount that you will owe on the *next* statement. This delay in accounting for credits seems to me to be unfair, illogical, and not in keeping with how such transactions are treated by other providers in the industry. Certainly, it is not how cashback bonus redemptions or refunds are treated in my XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card accounts. I always pay the balance on those cards in full each month, and whenever I have a cashback bonus redemption or other credit to my account, I reduce my payment accordingly. I have been doing this for over a decade, and XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX treat those "" credits '' just like any other payment. 
Further problematic, to my mind, is that CapitalOne 's treatment of credits is conditional on subsequent transactions. This seems even more unjustifiable. Specifically, if, after a statement period ends, your subsequent "" credit '' transactions exceed subsequent purchases, then ( and only then ) the amount you need to pay to avoid finance charges is reduced by the difference. So for example, let 's say your statement for XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX shows a balance due of {$1000.00}, with payment due on XXXX XXXX. Then, on XXXX XXXX, you get a refund of {$300.00} ( say, because you returned an item you purchased in XX/XX/XXXX ). Under CapitalOne 's policy, that {$300.00} does not *necessarily* reduce the amount you need to pay by XXXX XXXX to avoid finance charges. If you charge nothing during XX/XX/XXXX, then you need only pay {$700.00}. But if you charge {$300.00} or more, you have to send CapitalOne {$1000.00} by XXXX XXXX. I can see no legitimate justification for this inconsistent treatment of the credit transaction. Either CapitalOne got that {$300.00} before the due date, or it did not. Its inconsistent treatment of the credit seems like an attempt to hide an improper policy from scrutiny by tempering its most egregious effects. 
A further ridiculous consequence of this policy : a direct redemption of a cashback bonus for statement credit is not a "" payment '', but if the cashback bonus is credited to my bank account, and I then send the money right back to CapitalOne, it is. 
CapitalOne 's odd practice is a trap for the unwary. At the very least, it should disclose the practice clearly, unambiguously, and prominently, in a location and context that ensures consumers will understand and be able to account for it.

Then on XXXX XXXX, 2015, a CapitalOne fraud rep named XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ext.

When i called their main fraud line at XXXX, they said my case was closed and that XXXX XXXX probably did n't have the right information and not to worry that everything was closed. XXXX XXXX XXXX then called me back and said I needed to answer all these personal questions and i told her i just got off the phone with her team and was assured everything was closed so she replied, "" fine, you will be responsible for all charges now '' then hung up.

When I spoke with Customer Service Rep I was told that it was changed as a result of a United States Postal Service address change done on XX/XX/2015. The Rep changed my address back to the correct address. The Rep advised me to call Fraud Protection tomorrow because they were currently closed. That night I also called the USPS and spoke with someone who informed me that there was no record in their system that my address was changed. If change was done on XX/XX/2015 it would have shown up in their system by now. XX/XX/XXXX Called Fraud dept, spoke with woman and told her that the previous person I spoke with did not verify my password before discussing my account, she made a special notation on account prompting password verification. Password placed on my account on XX/XX/2015, after being made aware that fraudulent activity incurred on XX/XX/2015, and is not being utilized. I called back to notify company that the XXXX had no record of address change and asked again What prompted the address change? No results after that phone call. XX/XX/2015 spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from USPS and verified that no address change placed in system. Called Credit Card company back XX/XX/2015 to further try and understand what exactly prompted the address change, so far information was confusing. Was transferred to "" XXXX '', after a brief research, I was told that a person in the collections department authorized and address change on my account 15min after previous Fraud Case closed. Question the timing for the case being closed and the phone call being made into company to the same department. Customers usually call Customer Service not Collections. I asked her how a person can call in and change info on my account without verifying my password? Was placed on hold and when she came back she informed me that they "" are not required to ask for the password ''. But as of XX/XX/2015 a special notation was placed on my account that stated that the password must be verified. I questions why was n't that put in place when I placed the password on the account in the 1st place back on XXXX? Again the response was that they are not required to ask for password, but they will from now on because of the special notation. No resolution after that phone call. Wanted to speak with Fraud Dept but they were closed. XX/XX/2015 Called again to speak with Faud Dept regarding matter, was told again that address change was from USPS, I had to tell them again that I spoke with XXXX there was no record of address change. Was transferred to Cust Serv Manager who informed me that it was not from USPS, that there was a notation on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX that someone called in and were unable to verify account password. However the address change time was noted to be XX/XX/2015 at XXXX. Confusing ... What compounds the situation is that the address was changed to a known fraudulent address ( police report made previously ) even though the person calling in was unable to verify the password. Information ( address of customer ) being changed on account even though person calling in was unable to verify password is unacceptable. I spent hours calling in on multiple days speaking with multiple personnel to try and find out what exactly happened and still am not XXXX % certain why address was actually changed.

I find the correlation between these XXXX seemingly unrelated matters very curious. 

Following the discovery of the credit report entries, I initiated disputes with both credit bureaus. XXXX response was to simply remove the entries from the credit report without providing an explanation. XXXX 's response was to keep the entries on the report and not provide any explanation whatsoever. 

This activity is highly suspicious. Capital One will not acknowledge requesting the information, and both XXXX and XXXX refuse to address the incidents. I reiterate : During all of XX/XX/XXXX, I was not once contacted by "" Capital One '', nor did I make applications for credit to any corporation, financial institution, or place of business. I strongly believe that XXXX ( XXXX ) hard-pulls for my CR within a XXXX MONTH TIME PERIOD by a company which I had and have no accounts with, nor solicited me regarding same, is ABUSIVE, EXCESSIVE, and SUSPICIOUS. The CRs reflecting these occurrences are attached to this Complaint. 

I request for assistance in obtaining an investigation or the results of any investigation already conducted, as well as those which may be conducted, into why these incidents occurred.

Capital One,"I have a balance with a 0.00 % interest rate yet I am still being charged a minimum interest rate/fee. A minimum interest rate/fee would mean my interest rate is not really 0.00 %. Very misleading.

Capital One,"I called into Capital One 's executive office to request a reconsideration of my credit line increase request placed online on XXXX/XXXX/15. I was informed by XXXX from there execuitive resolutions team that a new manual credit line increase application could be submitted and that they would do a soft pull on my credit. I agreed and I requested a credit line increase to {$25000.00}. A few days went by and I noticed that my credit line was increase by {$1500.00} to {$12000.00}. I called back in and the pin code that XXXX had given me to get to the executive resolutions team no longer worked. I spoke to a few associates who got me over to XXXX who was the senior account supervisor/senior customer advocate for capital one. When I asked to be connected back to the executive resolutions team she informed me that it was n't an appropriate call to go to there office. I asked her if she could have a letter sent out to me like in the past that explains why my credit line was not increased to the requested amount. She put me on hold for quite a long time and came back and said that the executive resolution team does not provide that information. I explained that in the past that I received that from them. She called back again and was told that reasons are only provided when a customer chooses not to accept a partial credit line increase. So I asked to be transferred again to that department so that I could re-apply for an additional manual credit line increase request and this time I would inform them that I would not accept a partial credit line increase so that I could get a letter that tells me why I did not qualify. 6 months ago when I have placed this request I was able to get a letter and the letter said I did not qualify because I did not have similar credit lines with other lenders. Now that I have had similar credit lines with other creditors I was n't to see why they will not approve me for the requested credit amount. 

XXXX reiterated that I did not qualify at this time as the credit line increase was only approved for a partial amount and stated that it was "" the highest I qualified for ''. I indicated that the Equal credit opportunity act requires that my application be taken. She indicated that she could get me over to the automated system to fill out the request. I told her that I already did that on XXXX and the system will not approve any requests for a credit line increase if you have had a change in credit line in the past 6 months which was confirmed with there executive resolutions team. That it was a violation of my rights to not transfer me to the team to apply for the manual credit line increase was discouraging and refusing to take my application for credit. If they allow one customer to go through this process they must let all customers go through the process every time they request it. 

When I asked her if she was refusing to let me speak with someone who could place the request she reiterated she did not believe that it was appropriate for her to transfer me to the executive resolutions team. This is a clear violation of fair lending laws.

I was told that it would be another two days. I asked if I could have an email confirmation of that. I was told "" NO '' they were not allowed to confirm that information.

Capital One,"We called Capiital One Bank at XXXX at XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/2015. We were asked question from the automated system including credit card number, social security number ( last XXXX ), security question, date of birth. After providing these answer we requested to speak to a 'representative '. The system responded that sorry we a closed, please call back during normal business hours. This seems wrong. We called back and were directed to someone in XXXX XXXX. 

We called a third time and spoke to several people at Capital One who did not understand the seriousness of information being provided to a department /organization that should not have my personal information. 

Further, when we called again, my wife spoke to someone who attempted to assist. They spoke a short while, and then handed me the phone. The Capital One employee, XXXX, then told me her name and said that we were on a recorded phone line. Interestingly there was no announcement to my wife about that the call was being recorded. 

We called again, and we recorded the phone call, the automated system DID NOT report that we were on a recorded line. We spoke to a representative who further DID NOT state that we were on a recorded line. We reported to the representative that we were recording their conversation. 

It is my understanding that when the Bank must state that calls are being recorded when they may be recorded. 

Our attempts to get someone from Capital One bank to be concerned over either issue was unsuccessful. 

We are concerned that : The Capital One Bank phone / computer system has been compromised and provides outsiders with personal information that could risk my identity. 

We are concerned that Capital One telephone banking does not provide information regarding when calls are being recording.

Capital One,"My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am a Capital One XXXX holder. This complaint relates to the dispute resolution process at Cap One, which they claim is regulated by XXXX, yet neither entity is able to provide me a copy of the said offending regulation. 
About a week ago, I initiated a claim to dispute a transaction that was charged in error by the merchant XXXX XXXX. Per usual Cap One issued an immediate credit for the transaction and I guess notified the merchant as dictated by their policies. In a span of a week, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received an email from Cap One notifying me of an important document available online for me to review. The said document was a correspondence from Cap One informing me that the merchant had apparently responded by sending them some sort of paperwork which I have n't even seen yet, leave alone be able to send in my response. Cap one further noted that they would be reversing the earlier credit they had posted to my account that would be reflected on my statement of XXXX XXXX. I figured that I 'd have at least till then to rebut the merchant 's claim as soon as the hard copy of whatever they had submitted reached me. Guess what? I was dreaming! The charge had appeared online the very next day which is today, XXXX XXXX. 
Obviously I called to challenge Cap One 's decision to charge back my account. Now, mind you, I have dealt with disputes and claims process with my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, before and even they, as attached as they can get to their research outcome into consumer disputes, are not quite as hard-nosed in handling claims as much as Cap One has been in my experience. In the twenty minutes I was on the phone with them, they told me that they were bound by a regulation from XXXX that mandated that they re-charge my account the instant the merchant named in the claim responds back. They seemed to be indicating that even though I had n't received any copies of the paperwork returned by the merchant yet, even though they were still in the process of reviewing my claim, and even though I had until XXXX XXXX to send in my response once I received those documents, they were obligated to reverse the credit issued barely a week ago and charge me account again. I demanded for a copy of the said regulation they purportedly were bound by in their relationship with XXXX. They could provide me none!! Instead, they gave me a toll-free number for XXXX and instructed to take up the issue with them. Hmpht! Seeing as I am on long-term XXXX, I was n't quite relishing having another testy exchange with another difficult corporate monster. And my reservation proved to be accurate. 
Next, I called XXXX at the number Cap One had provided me, XXXX. I had the misfortune of getting a representative by the name of "" XXXX XXXX ( I particularly made sure to get this identification before I hung up with her ). In the call which lasted fifteen minutes, she had my head spinning by giving me the worst run-around. I got the feeling that she was perhaps sneering at me with an audience present, and that what she was basically trying to accomplish was stall me so she could get schooled by a supervisor, or manger maybe. Her tone, and a barely audible sound of laughter in the background is what gave me that feeling. All she kept reiterating was that Cap One could not provide me with a copy of such information because that was part of an agreement between them and XXXX, nor would she send me a copy. Her tone did register an element of surprise when I informed her that Cap One 's review was ongoing, and I had n't even had a chance to respond to the merchant 's claims. As my frustration and exasperation began mounting, I then asked her which particular government entity regulated them. She started to school me on which classification her company fell under, how they were not

Capital One,"I was approved for a capital one XXXX card with a credit limit of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX of 2015.  A few days after being approved I logged in online only to see that my new card was restricted. I called in immediately and notified them of the message I received  to the representative, only to transferred from rep. to rep. and placed on hold for long periods of time until I eventually hung up with my issues still unresolved. I filed a XXXX complaint and its been XXXX days and there has still been no response. I feel that capital one is intentionally blowing me off.

Capital One,"I signed up for a capital one XXXX card in the XX/XX/XXXX, through an offer i received that clearly stated no interest for 15 months. however, after 11 months, Capital one began charging interest on my card. I believe i was misled by their marketing and scammed into paying more interest than predicted, causing me damages. I have been charged XXXX dollars per month in interest for months now before the 15 month promotional period even ended. Capital one is using deceptive marketing and advertising offers, and trapping consumers in deals that fail to live up to the promises made and what consumers are offered. I was caught off guard with these interest fees that should not have began until XX/XX/XXXX at least.

Capital One,"I am an Identify Theft victim and I was recently forced to hire a company to assist me in removing fraudulent files from my credit reports. 

After a thorough review of my reports, I noticed that Capital One had placed an inquiry to my reports on XXXX. 

After speaking with representatives from XXXX, I was told to notify Capital One in writing and wait for their response. Once I received a response, stating that the inquiry should be removed, I was to forward it to XXXX. This is their procedure for removing a Hard Inquiry. 

I sent a certified letter to Capital One and it was delivered to them on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The letter asked them to either remove the hard inquiry from my credit report or send me proof that I had given them permission to run my credit. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a response from Capital One. However, the letter I received did n't indicate whether I had applied for credit with them. It was informing me of the different types of inquiries, which I already had knowledge of. So, I contacted them by phone and was told that I had multiple accounts with them and one is presently documented as a paid closed account on my credit report. I asked the representative if she could forward me any information regarding these accounts and after nearly XXXX minutes on the phone, she encouraged me to communicate with the credit bureaus. 
I have never had an account with Capital One and I have never applied for credit with Capital One.

I also think they should be made to cease the false marketing of this product so that others will not be taken advantage of and have their credit wrongly affected.

Capital One,"Capitol One account # XXXX was a secured credit card account, started with a {$1500.00} deposit pushed up to {$2000.00}. Capitol One never applied deposit to amount owed on account and now have posted it as a charge off for the full amount and sold the account. But Capitol One still has account security deposit. That in itself makes the credit inquiry false and also is fraud.

Capital One,"My interest rate is too high on my credit card. I have asked Capital One to lower the interest rate so that my payments can be affordable. Capital one stated that since I had payments returned to my bank that I am not eligible for an APR decrease. They have also sent me some things about my payment being so expensive because of my XXXX insurance. I do n't have a problem with the XXXX insurance being added to my payment. My concern is that I have such a high APR rate. I have had a card with Capital One for at least XXXX years. My question is ... There is n't XXXX time that my account was not in good standing for Capital One to decrease my APR in XXXX years? It seems very odd to me.

Capital One,"XXXX XXXX applied for XXXX loans to get a XXXX submariner and was rejected. He subsequently used a Capital One Credit Card to make the purchase. All security channels deemed it high-risk except XXXX. XXXX cleared it and so we shipped the watch. An adjustment was made in the order when I informed him that the specific model he ordered was no longer made by XXXX and under their warranty. After which, I refunded him the difference. The watch was shipped. He returned the watch, but the watch weighed less that it did when we shipped it. We subsequently, returned the watch to him. He submitted a chargeback claim stating that he never received the watch. However, that is not true. Accordingly, Capital One did a chargeback on the transaction and XXXX XXXX has his {$13000.00} and the {$13000.00} XXXX watch. Since we have been negatively impacted by credit rating and with XXXX, we request that we receive our money plus expenses.

Capital One,"In XXXX 2014, I went over my credit card limit pumping gas at the pump by {$20.00}. For years I 've been paying my credit card bill online & that statement that follow had a minimum fee of about {$75.00} which I paid. However, for the next year XXXX Capital One charged me an over-the-limit fee every month, never again emphasizing on the online payment statement I was still over the limit. Being I had n't purchased anything on this card for a year I always paid the minimum fee over a bit more to try, what I thought I was doing, paying off the loan. However, the online payment window is vague with nothing more than the minimum payment, but I noticed after XXXX months my balance was going up. First off, I never agreed to allow Capital One to let my card go over the limit - which I thought was a new law- & that they were not supposed to charge me much more than the overage cost itself as the penalty. I would imagine the minimum payment should be such to get you back to your limit, but being this is not my only credit card I overlooked it. I believe they should not have let my card go over-the-limit with out my permission.

I have contacted the credit bureaus and Capital One directly. To date Capital One has not provided any verification documents on this account. They have exceed the legally accepted 30 day allotment to verify this account. According to the FCRA rules, if a creditor does not verify the debt within 30 days to the debtor, they are not allowed to continue attempting to collect the debt, nor can the creditor list the debt on the consumer 's credit report. This is a clear case of unverified debt. I have exhausted all efforts to resolve this matter.

Capital One,"I tried to dispute information that is being reported by Kohl 's credit card as being inaccurate by calling Kohl 's credit department multiple times. Kohl 's marked my credit report as being XXXX months late. Even though I told them it was n't my fault and I believe the fault lies more with them ... the reason being because I am signed up for paperless statements and emails all went to my vast junk mail without me ever knowing, because Kohl 's sent me an excessive amount of spam email in a short amount of time, my email service considered Kohl 's junk mail by default. Kohl 's blamed me and said they would not dispute the marks against me, even though I was acting in good faith and trying to work with them. Kohls ' options for paying my bill make me very nervous because I had to give my routing and account number over the phone which I was hesitant to do for a long time. Also my Kohl 's account number is hidden on the statement and they refused to give it to me over the phone, so I could not pay the bill in a manner I felt to be safer such as online bill payment ( where my bank has an account designed specifically for paying bills in a protected manner ). I can not believe Kohl 's policies on this. They need to be more respectful of the amount of excessive emails they send and they need to supply their customer 's their account number so the customer can pay in a comfortable safer manner. They also need to take a customer 's dispute more seriously, because the laws now are very strict in when it comes to a consumer making a genuine dispute and I felt I was treated unfairly, abused and being denied information. What is worse is my life is being negatively impacted this because I tried to get pre-approve for a mortgage and got denied and the banker mentioned Kohl 's! This credit card balance was approx. a small amount of {$150.00} and is now paid including late fees. I 'm getting denied from being able to buy my first home and starting my life as an adult because of Kohl 's abuse of financial power after lack of concern for their customer 's credit report for an error that occurred because of their excessive email spamming.

Capital One,"Capital One ( Quick Silver ) credit card continues to charge me an interest charge on cash advances. In the last several years they have charged me between $ XXXX {$700.00} in interest for these bogus cash advances charges. The company is not helpful in resolving these matters. When I talk directly to them, I am sent to a number where the person on the other end can not speak fluent english which creates a communication barrier. They seemed to use stall tactics, putting me on hold for up to XXXX minutes. There has been no resolution in years on this matter. The response is always the same, "" you must have made a cash advance transaction. My last response from Capital One was not productive in getting them to stop these bogus cash advance charges. They seemed to acknowlege that the stores where I make purchases from are coding them in a certain way therefore creating these charges. When I have asked local merchants about this they have no idea what I 'm talking about. I believe this explanation is baseless and is an outright lie. For now the charges continue although they have now decreased in the amount from $ XXXX {$6.00} down to XXXX on these transactions. This is not ethical and I consider it to be theft on their part.

Capital One,"I have a Capital One checking and credit card account ( for now ).

The scheduled payment was enough to pay the balance but ... ..Capital One withdrew the autopayment and the scheduled payment leaving me with a substantial overdraft in my checking and a considerable credit in my credit card account. My concerns here are as follows:1 ) If I were to schedule a payment that was in excess of 10 % of the existing balance Capital One would not allow it so why would they allow a duplicate payment of ~60 % of the balance? 
2 ) Why does it take less than 24 hrs to withdraw my money but 8-60 days depending on which of the XXXX representatives I spoke with to get it back? 
3 ) Why if I overpaid the balance on the credit card would I be assessed an interest fee? While they did eventually credit the account for the interest, it seems like this process is set up to systemically drive unsupported fees.

When I call about the incorrect late fee, they tell me they will "" reverse it '' and it should be reflected on my next statement. But then the cycle repeats. I make a payment they either "" did n't receive '' or it 's applied too late and yet another late fee is applied. This happened for months and months and months on end with both Capital One accounts.

I next called the Capital One customer service department. I spoke to an agent and explained the reason for my call. He then told me he would be processing a payment but that I would get a late fee. I asked for a supervisor and received one. The supervisor told me that the payment was made by the previous representative and that I would be able to get the late fee waived. She specifically looked and told me the prior agent had processed my payment during the very call we were then on. 

The next day I called to make sure the payment had been made. When I found that it had not, I asked again for a supervisor. The supervisor explained that no payment had been processed by either the customer service agent or supervisor the day prior. I then made yet another payment. 

I want to make this complaint because it is in Capital One 's interest to improperly process payments. They make considerable sums of money on the late fee scheme. Had I not called in just to make sure, the payment would have never been made and Capital One would have surely notified the credit reporting agencies of my failure to make a payment on my account.

We had some credit cards together XXXX of which, would either come in XXXX our names or just my husbands, as primary ) and he had cards in just his name with me as an authorized user ( of which, would either come in just his name or in both ). With this particular card, I truly believe that I was merely an authorized user and thus, not liable on the debt. Despite repeated phone calls disputing this debt ( going back to XXXX though they first have it documented in XXXX XXXX, I am not only continually harassed by their collection team but they kick me around to different units every time I call to resolve this issue ( from collections to the decedent group to customer service ) every time I call requiring up to 3 hours of my time. I have requested evidence that I am on the contract as a joint party XXXX given situation described above of other cards and the fact that it is easy for their system - due to human error/changing or migrating systems - to incorrectly categorize me, as this has happened with other cards XXXX. I was told they could not find the application and that I needed to write a letter to a unit Utah requesting the contract and I would receive the contract, evidence of, or a letter stating what happens if they do not have it. I was to receive this within 7 - 10 days or my written request. I tracked the letter I sent and it was delivered on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I still have not heard back. I still can not get any answers. I am still receiving harassing calls despite numerous requests to stop and my ongoing dispute of the the veracity of the debt, requiring me to stop answering my home phone - especially when company is over. They are still reporting delinquencies to credit bureaus even though I asked if they could stop or notate a dispute until resolved, which has caused me great humiliation as I could n't even qualify for a {$1000.00} limit at a furniture store to replace the couch my husband died on let alone refinance my mortgage to take advantage of lower rates ( causing me long term financial harm ). I do not mind paying if I am on the debt - as I have done so with other cards. However, I believe that this was only in my husband 's name. Instead, I consistently get treated poorly, get harassed by collectors - despite disputing the debt and asking them to stop calling - and get punted around seemingly eternally. Making all of this worse, is the extremely inconsistent information and "" answers '' I get every time. I am asking for simple proof - my personal experience and the events in mortgage servicing, for example, are demonstrative that I should not need to rely on their word or their system for proof as if it is infallible. Simply provide me with evidence and let us move onward. Simple request. Instead, the company continues to cause me emotional pain, stress, embarrassment, and direct financial harm. I am exhausted and drained. I need closure not more runarounds and false hope. I was supposed to have "" the answer '' within 7-10 days of XXXX XXXX, 2015. This has been going on now almost 6 months and has cost me emotionally and an undeterminable amount of money on my ability to refinance my mortgage. I understand economics and promises to pay and will honor it if I am, in fact, liable. However, I truly and reasonably believe this was XXXX of my late husband 's personal cards. By far, the worst company I have had to deal with during these trying times.

Capital One,"Capital One 's dispute process not fair. 

The ER Vet Clinic charged me for a XXXX admission for my cat at the cost of XXXX. The XXXX Admission was not needed. All that was needed was a change of medication = XXXX and a Gel Supplement = XXXX. I asked for the medication change and supplement several times and was given other recommendations or medication. The end result was that the cat was in worse shape than when I started almost XXXX later, I did n't admit her a XXXX time ; instead I took her to the family Vet who gave me exactly what I asked for and the cat bounced back in 2 days. ( see attached detailed document ) It was a light bulb moment because I realized that Animal Emergency intentionally inflicted pain upon my XXXX and myself. They hospitalized her XXXX for financial gain. 
REASON for COMPLAINT : Capital 1 requests documents to prove things that are impossible to obtain, especially if your complaint is about a service. I also believe that their Representatives are forced to tell lies and placate consumers in order to run out the clock. I filed a dispute with Capital One and they ruled against me and I did n't even know it had happen until I received a bill stating I had to pay interest. 
Events : Dispute was filed in mid XX/XX/2015 = I received letter from XXXX explaining their actions ( c attached ) XXXX/XXXX/15 Cap 1 grants a charge backXXXX/XXXX/15 approx. I get the Cap 1 XXXX/XXXX/15 letter asking for additional documents and a 2nd opinion. ( c attached ) XXXX/XXXX/15 = I complied and faxed the documentation, with exception of 2nd opinion. The XXXX Vet was out of the State. I did however give them the Vet 's detailed notes that expressed his opinion, actions and why he took the actions. 
Additionally on XXXX/XXXX/15 = I spoke to a Cap 1 Supervisor named XXXX after speaking to a idiot in regards to Cap 1 's request that I send them a credit voucher and XXXX opinion. I explained that the Vet was out of town, asked how the heck could I get a credit voucher. She told me that the XXXX opinion was really the problem. I told her to read the notes. The notes clearly state not only opinion, but his actions and there out come. XXXX said she would go higher up and she did. I got a call back from XXXX approximately 2 days later telling me that they would except the detailed Vet notes as the 2nd opinion. She would take my dispute up to the actual Cap 1 Dispute Board. I was to wait for a letter. 
XXXX/XXXX/15 I got another letter regarding the credit voucher. I disregarded the letter because it was about the same subject that I spoke to the idiot about. The letter also arrived the day after our conversation. ( c attached ) XXXX. XXXX/XXXX/15 I spoke to XXXX again and she told me # 1 that the Merchant had until XXXX to respond to my Vet 's documentation. She also asked me for a letter from the 2nd Vet stating that his opinion was his opinion. I told her that I had asked him to do so already and he refused. My Vet did n't want to involve himself any further and felt that not only did he give an opinion, he brought forth action. 
Between XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/15 = I called XXXX XXXX, her extension was disconnected. I left XXXX messages, the last on XXXX/XXXX/15 ; with someone named XXXX. She nor anyone else ever got back to me or sent me another letter. I just received a bill showing that I am paying interest and more of a minimum payment and that 's how I know they ruled against me.

I retired from my job and moved since XXXX, and since my income is now reduced and I am a senior on a fixed income, I have n't been able to get wifi in my home yet as I am still paying off moving expenses. I ended up making a payment in XXXX 1 day late because of the time zone difference ; when I logged in later at the public library to check on my account I saw I had been charged a late fee. I called to let them know the circumstances, but by then they had tacked on another late fee because I only paid ( on time ) the usual payment of {$39.00} and it had evidently gone up to {$64.00} with the late fee, which then made my next payment {$99.00} ... so I called and talked with several CS reps and finally was able to get the fees refunded and the payment back to {$39.00} as I double-checked with the rep I was talking to, XXXX, I think.

Capital One,"In an XXXX XXXX, 2015 letter from Capital One, I was informed in an unsigned letter that someone may have opened a credit card account using some of my personal info. The letter provided a reference number of leading xs and ending in XXXX digits.Beneath the reference number was a XXXX "" Case Number ''. In a letter of XXXX XXXX, 2015, I wrote Capital One indicating that I was exercising my right to obtain documents relating to fraudulent transaction made or accounts opened using my personal information and thus was requesting a copy of applications and other business records relating to the attempt to create ( or the creation ) or establishment of an account in my name. My written request resulted in a standard form letter, dated XXXX XXXX, that was not responsive but which was assigned a different reference # and corresponding Case No. that was different from the first. The letter was not signed. The letter asked that I provide ( 1 ) any supporting documentation, such as my credit report, ( 2 ) a copy of the XXXX XXXX letter, ( 3 ) a copy of my original request dated XXXX XXXX, and ( 4 ) completion of a separate attachment. The attachment asked for my Name, Address on file with Capital One ( unknown so N/A ), Current Address, Account Number ( unknown so N/A ), SSN, and Date of Birth. I completed the information on the attached page, made copies of the correspondences, and mailed back to Capital One, XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX UT on XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, I received the SAME FORM LETTER /attachment with a THIRD different reference number/Case No. from Capital One. XXXX was unresponsive. In my follow-up letter of XXXX XXXX, I cited all of the XXXX reference/case numbers and demanded that Capital One not send another form letter. But on XXXX XXXX, I received the same form letter with new reference/case no. Discussed, I called the 'customer fraud protection team ' @ XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) on XXXX XXXX and spoke for more than 20 minutes back and forth with XXXX who did not provide a call back extension and who promised to give me a call back after speaking with her supervisor about my request to send me the online application that was completed using my personal information. XXXX told me that I could not receive the document but would check and call me. On XXXX XXXX I called back at XXXX XXXX to follow-up with XXXX but was blocked by XXXX who took up the battle for 57 minutes trying ( but unsuccessfully ) to explain that of the XXXX reference/case numbers, only XXXX was 'valid ' and that there was no application - contrary to what XXXX had said. Then XXXX told me I would have to fax XXXX govt-issued photo IDs, a notarized signed statement, and copy of my SSN card. She provided no name for the fax and could not guarantee that even after all of that I would get the application. I asked why these requirements were not specifically cited in the responses from Capital One instead of the same form letter. And why was there no one dedicated to my case. XXXX was not even clear on the process and what became of the correspondence mailed to the POB. After speaking with her, I became concerned that each case number represented a separate attempt to open a new credit card. But she felt I should not be concerned because only XXXX case number appeared from her search ... the others were unsuccessful. I 'm complaining that this process by Capital One for handling fraud cases is broken and disconnected. Neither would XXXX or XXXX elevate or refer me to their supervisor.

Capital One,"When I was shopping at Kohl 's on XXXX XXXX, 2015, the salesclerk convinced me to apply for a Kohl 's charge card by promising that I would get 30 % off of my purchase. However, instead of the application being accepted, a receipt printed that said : "" We are unable to complete processing of your application at this time. '' The clerk said that this meant that my application was declined. He could no longer provide me with the 30 % off. Additionally, he took back the written terms and conditions for the credit card. I questioned him if the application was in fact denied, since that was not what the receipt said. He said that the application was denied and that 's what that message meant. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called the Kohl 's Charge Account customer service number at XXXX. I spoke with XXXX, who then transferred me to XXXX. I wanted to confirm that the application was in fact denied and was not being processed. XXXX stated that my application was denied and I would be receiving a letter within 30 days explaining why it was denied. 
Since I did not receive the promised discount and was not able to keep a copy of the terms and conditions - and therefore was not able to read the terms and conditions - I wanted to make sure that the card was not processed. I fully understood that there would be a credit pull on my credit report ; however, if the application was still being processed and was not declined, I did not want a trade line reported or something showing that I closed the account, since this will negatively affect my credit. 
Imagine my surprise when, instead of receiving a letter stating why my application was denied, I received a credit card in the mail. So, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I wrote to Kohl 's Credit Customer Service. I asked for a refund of the amount I should have saved if I had received the promised 30 % discount. I also asked for Kohl 's to mail me a copy of the credit card 's terms and conditions and train its employees to provide accurate information. 
I received a letter from Kohl 's dated XXXX XXXX, 2015. Enclosed was a copy of the Cardmember Agreement. However, Kohl 's declined to provide me with the promised discount because I did not make any purchases on a Kohl 's Credit Card - which I could n't do, because at the time of purchase, the application was still being process. However, Kohl 's offered a courtesy credit on a future purchase. This offer was not clear, so on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I sent an email to the address provided by Kohl 's to clarify the courtesy offer. 
Kohl 's responded that it could n't assist me by email so I called the customer service number on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I spoke with XXXX. She informed me that Kohl 's would provide me with a 30 % discount if I made a purchase with my Kohl 's card and then submitted a claim for a credit to my account. But, I could not combine the 30 % discount with any other discounts being offered at the store. So, for example, if the store was offering a 20 % discount, I would need to skip the 20 % discount and not use any coupons in order to receive the 30 % discount from the Kohl 's card. Or, I could go on one of the days when the store was not offering any discounts - XXXX checked and there were only XXXX such days in the entire month. 
Since I was not being offered the promised benefit that induced me to sign up for the card, I asked Kohl 's to cancel the card. Since Kohl 's refused to honor its promotion and I never activated or used the credit card, I asked Kohl 's to request that the consumer reporting agencies XXXX CRAs ) suppress the trade line. XXXX said that she could n't do that but that I could send a formal request in writing. My credit history should not be adversely affected by a company that does not honor its promises and does not adequately train its staff to correctly answer inquiries.

It has been nearly 8 years since this occurred, and I am still riddled with issues in their reporting and that they 've "" charged off '' the account. I have contacted them on several occasions requesting they provide proof of ownership ( signed documents ) and that all charges were legitimate. In each instance, they have never responded. I have disputed these entries on my credit files and they are continually updated with inaccurateinformation. 
In the past 60 days, I have once again sent correspondence to both XXXX and the creditor requesting validation of acct ownership. Each time, they do not provide anything other than an electronic verification that what information they have is correct. When I dispute the accounts to show that fraudulent charges were made on the account, I 'm told that the creditor will not respond and that I need to speak with them. 
I have done all I can do to get this resolved. The only thing that the creditor and XXXX are doing when I dispute these items is to verify my name, SSN and account status - NOT FRAUD CHARGES. 
By law, they have not responded with evidence and appropriately within 30 days to the legitimacy of the charges and have not provided any response or evidence they are investigating the nature of the charges associated with my former acct. In doing so, they 're in violation of the FCRA laws and must remove all entries of this account immediately.

Capital One,"This complaint could be much longer and include many more details, but I will keep it as brief and concise as possible. 
I ordered a watch from a merchant, which arrived with several defects. XXXX of the defects was bent hands, and I took it upon myself to straighten them myself. 
I carefully checked the merchant 's terms and conditions before I did this, and there was nothing which indicated doing this would invalidate the warranty. When I notified the merchant about the problem and told him that I had fixed it myself, he immediately acccused me of lying and blocked my from accessing his website by banning my IP address. I asked to return the watch for a refund, as the merchant obviously was not going to honor the stated 2 year warranty. My request was denied on the grounds that merely opening the watch case voided the warranty - even though this was not forbidden in the merchant warranty policies. 
I disputed the charge on my credit card through Capital One, who sided with the merchant. It turned out that in the merchant 's response, he fraudulently altered the terms and conditions on his website in response to my dispute, and then submitted those in his rebuttal. In other words, the warranty policy that the merchant relied on in the dispute was not the same policy that was in effect when I made the purchase. It was XXXX that the merchant invented specifically to deny my claim. 
I provided proof of this fraud to Capital One in the form of screenshots of the merchant website, but they would not change their ruling. They only said that they had to base their decision on the merchant 's policy, even though I provided proof that the policy was changed after my dispute was filed. The specific changes can be seen in this screenshot : XXXX 
Afterwards, I contacted the merchant again, asking him how he justified changing the terms whenever he felt like it, without even notifying customers. His response was that it was always the "" intent '' of the policy, he just made it "" more clear ''. Unfortunately, as a customer who relies on the text of the policy as stated ( not the merchant 's intentions at any given time ), this leaves me at a disadvantage. And I do not believe that Capital One and Visa properly took this into consideration during my dispute process.

Capital One,"I have XXXX unsecured credit card accounts with Capital One Bank. In XXXX 2015, I applied for a credit limit increase and was denied for arbitrary and unfair reasons. The explanation given was the following : ( 1 ) Too many missed payments on other monthly accounts. 
First, I do not have ANY missed payments or collection accounts reporting on either of my credit reports. Secondly, and to justify the denial, Capital One Bank stated that my credit utilization rate was too high. My credit utilization rate may be higher than 30 percent, however this has nothing to do with my ability to repay my accounts on time each month. 
As a matter of practice, credit card issuers make their money off credit account holders such as myself ; That is those who routinely carry a balance. Therefore, the reasons for denying the credit limit increase have nothing to do with my ability to pay my bill on time. Also, the request was made almost 6 months ago and I currently have a higher credit score than I did at that time, however still am not eligible for a higher credit limit. 
I also believe that due to the number of CFPB complaints made against Capital One Bank, I am being denied credit with the bank.

On my credit reports the capital one bill decreases with payments made to XXXX. Also, the account with Capital One EXCEEDED the credit card limit due to OVER the LIMIT FEES. I never signed anything agreeing to go beyond the credit limit due to them adding OVER THE LIMIT FEES. I want to see my signature agreeing to OVER the LIMIT fees. Is n't it criminal to set a credit limit for me then charge me more, because your over the limit fees, place me over the limit more??. Even though Capital One wrote this off in XX/XX/XXXX, they have still been collecting money on this account as late as XX/XX/XXXX. If you look at the decreasing balance on my credit reports for capital one this is evident. 
"
Capital One,"I paid and settled a credit card account with capitalone for more than the amount the actually limit was for, however capitalone is reporting the item on all credit reporting agency as paid and settle for less than the amount. The credit card limit was only XXXX dollars, however on my credit report indicates that XXXX was written off. I have sent challenge letters and even notarized disputes to request for the negative tradeline be removed from all credit bureau agencies or update my credit report as paid and full.

Capital One,"I requested on XXXX 2015 for Capital One to have my credit card closed and I paid my account in full. Capital One put the account in restriction mode and they have assessed their bank fees for annual fee, interest fee and late fee on an account that I requested closed with a zero balance. I am demanding to have Capital One issue credit to account. I contact them on XXXX XXXX, 2015 to request and the agent was so rude and would not provide information. Her name is XXXX ( would not provide last name ) ID # XXXX, telephone XXXX. 
I asked her why she ca n't provide last name since I provide my personal information she was so rude and stated she ca n't.

Capital One,"I have an account with Capital One, a XXXX credit card. A fraudulent charge has been applied to my account and this was done on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I disputed the charge with Capital One and they sent me some illegible information provided by the company that placed the charge, XXXX. The bottom line is that I never gave XXXX permission to charge to my Capital One account, but Capital One is saying someone gave my credit card number to XXXX. Capital One says it was XXXX, and XXXX says it was Capital One. Again, I never authorized this charge or provided my number. 
"
Capital One,"It appears there is some miscommunication between Capital One and myself. Without doing all the details last year, I had to install an automatic call recorder on my cell phone number XXXX. 

I received a notification of a 30 day late pay from equifax. This appears to have occurred according to the credit reports ( all of them ) sometime in XXXX of 2015. I called in not aware that my cell was recording the call ( had forgotten ) Although I made a payment timely, it was not credited for whatever reason. The service rep who is employed by Capital One and identified himself as a Capital One Employee states on the recording that there was a system error when I made the payment thus not crediting it to my account nor removing it from my bank account. It is and has been Capital One 's position that there contract with the Credit bureaus does n't allow them to change this supposed late pay that was made timely and was not credited nor deducted according to their own employee as a result of a SYSTEM ERROR ON CAPITAL ONE 'S END. I do n't want to retain a lawyer but will and I am sure after they hear the recording which I have offered to let any capital one employee hear and they have refused. Capital One 's position is that we ca n't record calls. Fortunately, I live in XXXX and while substantive law may be in XXXX, the fact is that the recording was by mistake and was done in XXXX and is fully admissible in any court. The number is Capital One 's and the employee is clearly a Capital One employee. All I get is we are not going to change this. I have tried through Social Media and while a woman was very helpful she said she ca n't change it but offered no explanation other than it was late. I have sent numerous letters to XXXX and various addresses and still have gotten no response even though these were disputes by me according to the FCRA and FDCPA. All I want are the reports updated to show never late and remove the XXXX ding on this account for what the 2 or 3 years I have had it. Even if I was late which I deny, I do n't understand why as a gesture of good will, Capital One would n't remove it for a person who had just supported XXXX people after his wife was injured by a maniac surgeon ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX my now ex-wife is XXXX XXXX. ) I paid over XXXX XXXX in medical bills supported a family working XXXX hours per week and dont ' understand the lack of good will nor accountability here. I have been told the contract with the CRA 's requires this. The contract first of all has about XXXX exceptions and allows for updates for a bank or credit card company one time for good will and allows re-do 's when the bank has made an error. I do n't like filing this complaint. I would prefer not to eventually hire a lawyer and file complaints with multiple federal and state agencies. I just want my credit updated in accordance with my recorded conversation with the Capital One employee. Thank You

Capital One,"I 've had XXXX accounts with capital one since roughly XXXX. I had XXXX of the same product for a long time. Yesterday, XXXX XXXX XXXX I was chatting with a representative where I was informed I qualified to be upgraded to a venture card where I get XXXX miles for every dollar spent. I thought this was great and decided to close my other XXXX accounts and transfer the credit lines to my new venture card. Well it turns out that that the venture card is a subprime card where I only get XXXX miles for every dollar spent and my interest rate is 24.99 % variable. They gave me an offer for 7 months to lower rate to 20 % variable. Prior to combining the accounts I had XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts and XXXX of them had a 14.99 % rate variable however, since it was the lowest rate out of the XXXX they charged me a {$79.00} dollar annual fee which they refused to waive. Now I closed that account and moved the credit line due to missinformation and I was clearly missled here. I have a XXXX card with a super high interest rate, poor rewards and I no longer have the card with the 14.99 % interest rate. If I would have known the venture card does not earn XXXX miles for every dollar I would not have closed the other accounts and moved the lines over. I feel missled as a consumer specially since they were charging me an annual on XXXX card and not charging it on the other XXXX cards even though they were the exact same product. If you do it in XXXX card you should do it to all the same products and in my case they were the exact same cards. They just did not want to waive the annual fee because my interest was 14.99 %. I am extremely upset.

I then contacted Capital One and explained the situation, and they Temporarily issued the credit back to my account. The talent agency then did a chargeback to my account, and placed a rebuttal. I do acknowledge the charge with my signature, however, they sent me copies of some documents. One of the documents did have my signature for the charge of {$190.00}. but they also included a second document, which I did not sign, which acknowledged the "" no refunds '' policy.

I thought it was a scam to get my identity and ignored it. I then received my credit card in the mail with a welcome letter. I called the number on the card to activate it. I was told that i had to send in documents to verify my identity. I sent them a copy of my drivers license with my current address, social security card, utility bills of gas and electric with my current address to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ATTN : XXXX Fraud Dept.-FIT. I then received a letter from Capital One dated XXXX/XXXX/2015 that says "" we suspect fraudulent activity on your credit card so we placed a temporary hold on it to make sure no one is using it without your permission ''. I did not hear from them for 10 days so i called them back. They said they never received the documents, I sent them the same copies again to the same address. About 2 weeks went by so i called them again. A lady i spoke to apologized, said i was approved, and she released the card for me to use. I started using the card, made at least XXXX purchases, then received another phone call from Capital One saying the card was suspended because they never verified my social security number. I decided that i was going to just pay off my purchases and cancel the card but when i go to my e-mail online account it wo n't let me access the account.

My welcome letter from Capital One shows a credit check from XXXX so i do n't know if it is them i need to go after but i assumed my social security number is in my credit reports. i do n't know what to do so i am filing this complaint. 
"
Capital One,"I have attempted numerous times to resolve this issue with Capital One. I have used their chat system, phone system, and direct mail requesting attention to and correction of the issue at hand. I am submitting this complaint as a last resort. 

I opened the Capital One Mastercard at hand on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Several years ago I put the card aside in favor of another, leaving the account open paper statements and automated payments on, in case any charge was incorrectly billed, or a statement not received. I have not used the card in over 3 years. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX a charge of {$11.00} was erroneously submitted to my Capital One Mastercard. I was never alerted to the charge, never received a statement reflecting the charge, mailed or electronic, for the month it was billed, or the next. Capital One nonetheless added a late payment charge to my account, and then another, plus interest, while failing to send a statement or alert that there was a balance on the account. I received no phone call, email, or other contact. My contact information is and was correct and up to date. Similarly, my account had automatic payments setup to avoid such a situation, and no automatic payment was submitted or applied. I only learned of the balance from a credit monitoring service after Capital One reported negative information on my credit report. 

I take my credit, reported information, and scores very seriously. I am vigilant about paying my bills and always paying on time. I have XXXX negative items on my credit reports, that is, until XXXX XXXX, when Capital One incorrectly reported the above as a missed payment, to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 

Even after being alerted to their error, Capital One refuses to do anything to correct the mistake. In fact they act intentionally to reaffirm the information they report, without reviewing that it is correct. 

Filing a dispute with the CRAs is useless. Capital One 's nvestigations into disputes are automated, include no human review, and rely solely on the self-reinforcing data they have previously provided. No actual verification takes place. Blanket, automated confirmations sent in response to disputes. Investigations and review of their responsibilities to furnish accurate and complete information are instant, and even take place on weekends and holidays during which Capital One business offices are closed. 

Capital One does not take seriously or respond to requests for review, completely disregarding their responsibilities and requirements as a furnisher of data to consumer reporting agencies. They have XXXX regard for the devastating financial and personal harms they have caused by incorrectly reporting negative information. 

I want to close my accounts and sever any and all relationships I have with Capital One, but am afraid that if I am to close my account they will never fix this issue. It is for this reason I turn to submitting a dispute, in the hope that the error is corrected on my credit report, and that Capital One does not continue doing this to others.

Capital One,"Capital one Gm card offered to provide a resolution after my repeated requests for help since they have me at an exorbitant interest rate above 20 % and when I ca n't make payments on time their late fees are killing me. After a year of earnestly trying to keep up with sizable payments my balance is exactly the same. 

After 6 weeks of repeated phone calls saying they would help, they ultimately called today and told me they would not offer me any help or resolution of any kind whatsoever. They also told me that any offer of a settlement that had been extended has been rescinded. 

Further, they had promised to help resolve my issues before the next pay period. They of course did n't. 

When I called back after their account person, ( XXXX XXXX ) literally hung up on me, I was then told that MY ACCOUNT IS N'T IN BAD ENOUGH STANDING to qualify for any settlements. They literally admitted that they were only seeking to help themselves by offering to look into a settlement option. They would rather I keep being stuck in my high interest rate XXXX with no option for a settlement since I had been paying for the last year attentively. 

My calculations show that interest and fees combined put my effective interest near 40 percent over the last year.

Capital One,"I visited XXXX 's on XXXX/XXXX/2016 to purchase lunch for myself and a coworker. The bill came to {$11.00}, which I paid with my CapitalOne Mastercard. 
I logged into my online account on XXXX/XXXX/2016, and when reviewing and reconciling account activity, I observed a second transaction dated XXXX/XXXX/2016, also from XXXX 's, in the amount of {$17.00}. I double-checked my receipt and then placed a call to CapitalOne customer service to inform of the incorrect billing and to dispute the charge for {$17.00}. The female representative was distracted and repetitive. I clearly explained the nature of the dispute, and informed her that I could provide the receipt showing the correct amount. It took me numerous attempts for her to send me a secure link to upload the receipt. 
Two days later, I received a request to contact CapitalOne. I promptly contacted customer service again, where after another very frustrating conversation with a representative who was again distracted and repetitive, I became irritated. She connected me to a supervisor, who informed me that my previous dispute for an incorrect charge had been opened as a dispute for fraud, and that she must invalidate my card. After clarifying again that the dispute was due to an incorrect billing and not fraud, the supervisor placed me on hold for about 5-8 minutes. She then agreed to correct the previous dispute, but refused to acknowledge the previous rep 's incorrect actions, or take ownership of the clear need for training. 

This company needs to provide adequate training to representatives, and when an employee error is identified, to take ownership of how such an error impacts customers.

I do not know who this company is and have not done business with them. I was given XXXX 's phone number. I contact XXXX who would not give any reason as to why the order was canceled even though my credit card company, Captial One approved the charge. XXXX said they could not release the funds back to my credit card and told me to call Capital One. I then called Capital One who informed me the could not release the funds back to my account and that XXXX had to do the release. I explained that XXXX informed me to call them. At that point the Capital One representative told me there was nothing he could do. I asked him if this third party company who I had never done business with could really hold my money indefinitely. He claimed them could and ended the conversation. 
"
Capital One,"I am writing because I believe I am being scammed by my former credit card provider, Capital One. I recently called their customer service to ask for help with an unauthorized charge to my credit card. On XX/XX/XXXX, after my car broke down, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX for a tow. The tow-truck driver attempted to use my credit card twice as payment for the tow. He told me the charges were declined or failed to go through. As a result, I was forced to pay {$50.00} cash for the tow. Three days later I had XXXX {$50.00} charges on my credit card, which I assumed were from those two attempts. I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that I had not authorized the charges, and that I had "" no receipt '' or any other document of such transactions. I expected Capital One, to call either the tow company or its credit provider to find out what the problem was. They clearly did not make any form of contact with either since I spoke to the owner of the tow company. When I called the tow company on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that their records did not show any charges. I was assured that even if my credit card was charged accidentally, the credit will return. This I believe is where a possible scam within Capital One is taking place. I suspect that when a customer calls about unauthorized credit card charges, which Capital One would otherwise have returned had the customer not tipped them off by asking to dispute the claim, rather than crediting the customer 's account, Capital One instead initiates some bogus claim dispute. Capital One asks for documents that it clearly knows do not exist, such as credit receipts for fraudulent charge, which the customer "" has explained do not exist, '' in order to prolong the process or get a customer to default on a claim. Through this process, I suspect that Capital One scams its customers out of money, which it would otherwise have returned to the customers ' credit cards had the customers not asked Capital One for help. Because I refused to accept this, I have been led for 3 months to believe that my claims would be taken care of. I believe Capital One has done nothing the whole time since I have been the XXXX contacting them to get any serious update. For instance, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, which stated that XXXX of my {$50.00} claims was closed. The letter said that the other {$50.00} claim would be rebilled to the merchant, and if the merchant recharges my card, then it would be closed as well. When I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX for updates, I got all kinds of obvious excuses. I was told that based on the document I sent, none of my claims were strong enough. So, I should dispute the claims with the merchant. They did not mention anything about the rebill to the merchant, which was strange since my credit card was recharged only {$50.00} suggesting that the other {$50.00} supposedly rebilled was likely just another last minute excuse, considering all they had to do was add or subtract numbers. Furthermore, about a month ago, Capital One was uncooperative when the tow company owner asked me for documents to show his credit company to look into my dispute. Capital One created an impression that if I sent them a copy of my original "" cash receipt, '' they would fight the dispute. Yet, during the XX/XX/XXXX phone call, I was told that based on the receipt I sent, they did not feel I had a strong case worth fighting for. I have had smaller credit charges to my account in the past, which they have not even requested a single document, and which were less credible than this one. I feel that they may be bias against me perhaps because I recently opened a {$4000.00} credit line with XXXX XXXX. I was also recently forced to close my Capital One bank account because they started charging me monthly fees, around XX/XX/XXXX, even though when I opened the account I was guaranteed no monthly charges. 
"
Capital One,"I have a legal item showing on my credit report for {$3800.00}. This was from Capital One. I was not allowed to make minimal payments during a financial hard ship I was in due to particular medical issues and money. I was trying to work to keep this item paid the best I could at the time. They wanted me to put a huge "" down payment '' in order to lock in and secure a settlement amount. I was not able to do that. I had no one to borrow money from and cause if this account on my credit I could n't do a balance transfer like they suggested. This item was place in my credit as a lien item ( ref # XXXX ). I have tried to work with them to get this matter resolved and was asking the best attempt to pay this with payments of {$50.00} which they told me I HAD to set up with auto payments. They did not allow. Me to make payments on this as a settlement amount, which I feel is unfair and a lie. I have heard other people are able to do so and have done so. They told me the lowest settlement amount was like 60 % of the total debt. I feel that was an unfair statement and a lie. The debt was places with a so called attorney office but they were very rude and harassed me about this bill continuously with threatening tactics. I made a complaint to capital one and it was supposed to be sent back to original creditor, capital one, they told me I would receive a settlement offer in the mail, but never have. I am tired of the stress and hassle to try to pay this dept. I have had many unexpected medical bills come up. I think it is wrong when companies take advantage of consumer because we do n't know the proper wording to use to get them to be honest with us. It is unfair that one can pay 30 % of a debt that is owed and make payments toward that but they refuse to allow me to and say that 's not possible. That is unfair and deceptive and against the law.

I worked very hard for over a month to meet the requirements. I attempted again meeting the announced requirements and yet again, I was denied. The requirements listed were : "" XXXX of my cards must be in good standing, XXXX of my cards must be at a XXXX ( XXXX ) balance, both of my cards must be linked to online banking, and neither XXXX of my cards should have pending transactions ''. I called the bank and was told they could not tell me why I was denied because I met all the requirements. I also filed against the bank VIA XXXX. I received the same response from the bank VIA the "" XXXX '' as I did from the customer service reps. All I want to do is combine my cards to make it easier for me to manage my credit and pay my bills. If this is not possible and the account combination is a hoax, it is not funny and it should be taken down.

Capital One,"XXXX XXXX XXXX has reported to all XXXX credit bureaus that I have a delinquent credit card account with them that I do not believe is mine. I have sent numerous requests for proof of debt according to the FTC guidelines and have asked that they provide me with something with my signature on it that I indeed applied and used this credit card. To date, all I have gotten from them are responses to the effect that this account was applied for online and that I made a payment on the account. Still nothing showing proof that this debt and all charges thereto are indeed mine. I contacted the FTC about this situation and they referred me to you for help with this situation. All I 'm asking is that I get written documentation of some document with my signature on it that proves this debt.

Capital One,"I have a credit card with Capital One. I asked them to remove a "" 30 day late '' pay as a show of goodwill towards me. I 've read articles that suggested to do this, and I 've seen other credit card companies do it. Capital One said that they could not remove the "" 30 day late '' pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting act. I understand that creditors are required to report accurate data ; but can they do customers a favor by removing a "" 30 day late '' from the customer 's payment history?

Capital One,"Hello, I am writing this complaint with regards to a Balance transfer I did from my Capital One Credit Card account to XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card account on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I put the account number of my XXXX XXXX XXXX 's account and submitted the transfer. After 10 days when the funds were not showing on my XXXX XXXX XXXX 's account, I called the Capital one for the status and they confirmed me that funds have already been sent out. After further investigation, it was found that the funds were actually sent to XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX XXXX. They put my XXXX XXXX XXXX 's account number but sent it to the wrong address to XXXX 's and I do not have any account with XXXX 's. We then had a conference call first which was between me, Capital One and XXXX XXXX XXXX and they, XXXX XXXX XXXX, confirmed that the account number was right which I requested for Balance Transfer but they have not received any payment or funds. Then we had another conference call which was between me, Capital One and XXXX and representative from XXXX confirmed that I do not have any account with them, so they can not find any payment or funds. 
Later Capital One started investigation and as per them, they requested XXXX to return the funds from there missing file. This was done on XXXX XXXX, 2015. 
Yesterday, XXXX XXXX, 2015, when I called Capital One for an update, they told me that they have not received any funds back from XXXX and also they can not guarantee to refund my money if XXXX do n't reply them. 
I provided the correct Bank Information and Capital One erroneously wired/transferred funds to the wrong Bank. I have not received any funds, it was their error, yet they will not correct my account balance on the original credit card unless XXXX refunds. 
Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX

I have never missed a payment and so far as I know I have never had a payment returned. In good faith I went out to use the card and was unable to use it. Upon calling Capital One I was informed that they were holding my funds. At no time in the year that I have had this account have I ever had funds held for verification of payment. XXXX a customer service supervisor at Capital One would do nothing to assist other than to tell me to call them when the bank is open so they can verify the payment has cleared.

Capital One,"About a couple of weeks ago I received a phone call from a collection company from XXXX. The lady was very nasty requiring a payment to settle a collection account. I ended the call, but I was curious about why someone called me to settle an account. I went to XXXX to investigate where the call came from and it is from XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX, NM. My concern is that she is part of stealing my identity. Then immediately I went to XXXX to verify my credit information. Sure enough, I found to credit cards that someone else opened using my information. I have no knowledge on either XXXX of these accounts. I called Capital One Bank and XXXX XXXX and one ca n't find an account under my name and the other one did not help me at all. The purpose of this complain is to clear my credit from both of these accounts. I am submitting an individual complaint to solve each of the fraudulent accounts from Capital One Bank and XXXX XXXX XXXX.

This enclosed email from the merchant is the only documentation I received from the merchant ; therefore, I thought everything was resolved. Clearly, the merchant from the beginning should not have applied a charge to my account. I 'm grateful that you credited my account when I initially contacted you, and once again respectfully request that you re-credit my account for {$71.00} because I have provided per your request substantial documentation to the contrary.

Their privacy policy directs me to "" submit an unsubscribe request '' yet no feature exists on their website. The policy provides no alternative phone number nor mailing address.

Capital One,"I signed up for the Capital One XXXX rewards card with the intention of using this card for its travel benefits. Knowing I would be able to spend the {$3000.00} in the first three months required to obtain a XXXX mile reward, I applied and was accepted. I applied for the card and was accepted the beginning of XXXX 2015, and was given a 7 - 10 day estimate to when my new card would be delivered. It never came, I called it in XXXX XXXX, 2015 when it had not arrived after 14 days and was told they were sorry that the card was actually never shipped to begin with. They promised to expedite ship my card to me then, and that it would be at my address within 3 days time. It was not. I called again, this new representative looked at her system and stated that the card I was supposed to have expedited to me was also not ever in the mail. The previous rep had just taken down notes but never began the process of issuing a card to me. By this time, it is now a week into XXXX 2015. I finally get my card in the mail two weeks into XXXX, and call in to ask what can be done about the fact that I was supposed to have three months to spend {$3000.00}, but I will of had the card for only a month and a half. I was told to use the card as normal and that I would get a call back before the time period was up to discuss it further. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had told me that shw would take care of it, and that I should n't worry. I would be treated fairly. I proceeded to use the card, and called in when my time was running near, this is at end of XXXX. 

The rep that answered says that XXXX is not available but that she would have her give me a call back. She did n't. I call again after another week of no response. Only to have someone tell me that I could possibly get an extention on the time frame needed for the rewards bonus. But that I would need to wait for a response from her as she was supposedly a manager and this particular rep did not have that kidn of authority. I NEVER GET A CALL. I am just told "" you should get a call withing 7 -- 10 days from someone to help resolve this issue, we apologize for any inconvenience ''. I wait, and wait. Then wait some more. Nothing - for months. How can one make progress when the customer is the only XXXX showing initiative to reach out to resolve an issue, and the issuer does not even comply to their own statement of giving a simple call back? 

Enough was enough, I called XXXX last time, and was told that there is no record of anyone talking my calls and that they are sorry that there was nothing they can do from then on. I recorded times, dates, and employee numbers during this time. Yes, there is a record of calls made. the contract I signed when I was accepted for the card says THREE MONTHS to spend {$3000.00}, and I was given only HALF the time. Not once, did I ever receive a call that was promised to me. Not even once. 

Also, the automatic payments continues to charge my old bank account to pay off balances, even when I have deleted my old bank and inserted my new bank information. Glitchy webpages have made my old account overdraft by using the wrong source of payment. 
"
Capital One,"I have contacted Capital One to let them know of this unauthorized fraud account, however they sent me to collection and now I found out on my credit report that there is a judgment apparently they sued me for this account, and a judgment has been entered, when they did n't even let me know they sued me, so I could appear in court. I can not believe they held me liable for an account that I did not open, I have never done business with this this credit card company, and they sent me to collection and latter sued me for this and not even let me know they did. I had to find out from my credit report. Now I have a civil records and judgment that is filed against me for account that I did not open, with a credit card company I never done business with.

Capital One,"I have a Kohl 's charge account. 

I added my checking account information to their online system and it shows as verified. I initiated an online payment for my minimum amount due on XX/XX/2016. Kohl 's never attempted to withdraw the payment from my bank. My bank account records confirm this fact. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged a return check charge and the payment was reversed. 

I verified on my account page that my routing info is entered correctly. The system only allows you to see the last XXXX digits of your bank account, but I also confirmed that. Further, I confirmed the account number by entering it XXXX when initially adding the checking account on the Kohl 's website. 

Kohl 's erroneously failed to submit my payment to my bank correctly and then charged me a returned check fee. However, there were sufficient funds in my account at the time I submitted the payment and I provided Kohls with accurate routing and checking account number information. 

Upon a cursory XXXX search, I found that I am not the first person that this or something similar has happened to and that Kohls is engaged in a pattern of this behavior in order to collect extra late fees and reverse check fees from customers who pay their accounts diligently and on time. 

I will pay the balance of the Kohl 's charge in store to avoid any further incidents of this sort.

Capital One,"I was approved of a Capital One credit card, and received the card about 1 month ago. When I try to activate it, I was accused of identity theft, and they asked me to send a copy of my license, which I did. They told me they would call me in 1-3 days. Since then it 's been agonizing ordeal for me. I did not get any call from Capital One, thus I called them again, then they asked me to provide a copy of my social security card and a copy of my utility bill. I got my social security card some 40 years ago, and I did not have the card in my possession, thus I had to apply for the replacement card, and got the card, and sent them both, but still no response. I called them multiple times, and their responses were that they would review all the documents I provided, and would call me, in 1-2 days last time I spoke with them, but no still no calls. Literally I spent hours trying to solve this problem, but Capital One is keep on accusing me of fraudulent application and the identity theft. I have the excellent credit history, spanning over 30 years. They also sent a letter to my home address in name of XXXX XXXX, accusing me of identity theft, but the fact is that I lived in my current address ever since it was built over 20 years ago, and there was never a person named XXXX XXXX lived in my house. I can'e believe that such a national company like Capital One would have get such a wrong personal information, and accuse a legitimate customer of identity theft. 

Can you solve this problem for me. 

Thanks.

"
Capital One,"Capitol One MasterCard Statements are lacking proper and minimum disclosure of pertinent information and in my opinion have unacceptable and possibly illegal business practices as the deception is clearly intentional. Other major credit card companies have this information on them and for good reason, Cap One does not. 
Lack of proper disclosure of this particular information directly triggers a charge of a high monthly late fee {$35.00} and an increase in rate to nearly 30 %. Due to this and the obvious and evident outrageous attempt of Capitol One to keep hidden select data ( when a Past due is occurring ), it is clear that this lack of disclosure and the corresponding customer service training has been intentionally engineered to originate revenue from unknowing credit card holders at the expense of the client with their credit rating ( 7 yr derog ) in balance The information in question that has been intentionally hidden on their statements, in their email correspondence and on their website is as follows : A reasonable person would not be able to ascertain, even with all statements in front of them and emails, a ) if they were delinquent currently, b ) how much was delinquent c ) the date the past due amount became delinquent. Additionally, the Customer Representatives at Capitol One are most certainly trained to "" wash over '' the subject as complaints come in, it was very obvious that the Supervisor XXXX ID # XXXX got these complaints all day long and I brought that up on the phone. She agreed. Phone calls are recorded at Capitol One. I had to ask simple questions as to whether or not, and when, delinquency notices were sent 4 or 5 times and got different answers each time and got the same run around with almost every reasonable question. At the end she finally agreed that they do not send past due notices and that the reason the pertinent and furthermore misleading information was not on statements was due to the fact that they feel they have provided proper notification of delinquency by simply changing the color to red on the top bar of the statement ( still without the words "" Account is past due, Amount Past due, dates ... on statement, emails, web ). Later, I spoke with her superior who was present on the call with her ( he talked over her ), XXXX, ID # XXXX. 
These are my requests : Please have Capitol One add on the fine print in their statement the CFPB complaint contact information. 
Please have Cap One put the words "" Amount Past Due '' and the respective past due balance on their statements ( when an account is past due ), in their email correspondence and on their website for account holders. 
Please have Cap One put the words "" Account is Past Due '' where/when applicable on their monthly statements, email correspondence and on website clearly and without ambiguity in top left quadrant of statement ( where the red bar is ). 
Please have Cap One reword their emails with email statement link to read "" Account Past Due '' and Payment Due Now and Amount to bring current '' in the text portion of the monthly statement emails when an account is past due. 
Please have Cap One send out delinquency notices when an account is at least 30 days past due via email and through the mail. Not Statement emails, separate notices that specifically read "" Account past due '' and the amount needed to bring account current. 
Over limit Notifications : All of the above, please have Cap One also disclose as outlined above whenever there is an over limit occurrence and it should be generated the day the overage occurs. 
Rate Increases : All of the above, please have Cap One also disclose as outlined above whenever there is a rate increase and the notice should be sent/emailed the same that that the increase takes place. ( Just like with mortgage loans! ) Again, please protect us from these intentionally deceptive business practices of Cap One.

Capital One,"Mid to late XXXX, I wanted to trade my car in so I checked my credit to see what kind of rate I might get. I noticed that there was a hard inquiry on my report listed by Capital One. I found the inquiry alarming because I was dealing with fraud where an individual opened up a XXXX XXXX account using my name and social security number and I was receiving letters regarding car loan applications I never applied for! The Capital One inquiry showed up one month after I opened up a XXXX credit card. I 've been with Capital One for years, I have a checking, savings, Platinum, and XXXX card which were all in excellent standing. I contacted "" All Clear '' my credit monitoring service to assist me with the matter. XXXX the representative from "" All Clear '' and I contacted Capital One to inform them of their error. We were able to speak with a representative in Capital One 's fraud department and explained that there was a hard inquiry showing upon my report one month after I opened my XXXX card. I opened my XXXX card ending in XXXX, in XXXX of 2014, that inquiry hit the credit bureaus on XXXX XXXX, 2014. The erroneous inquiry showed up on my report with the date XXXX XXXX, 2014. After explaining the situation to the representative, it was clear there was either a clerical error or fraudent activity happen. The representative said that they would pull my initial application and check what was on file and see if there was a second application for the date in question. We were asked to follow up in a week or so. XXXX and I followed up a week after the initial contact with Capital One and their fraud department and were told that the application had not been pulled, but they believed it was a clerical error and they would more than likely remove the inquiry from my report, but it was a different department which handles that. We checked in several times after seeking status on our request, only to be transfer to XXXX incompetent person after another. We were told that this is a fraud case now and Capital One restricted and suspended both of the credit cards I have for years and paid promptly on! I received a letter in the mail stating the card ending I pin XXXX, was now closed due to fraudent activity! What!!!! They removed the incorrect inquiry on my credit report, and left the XXXX XXXX, 2014 inquiry on my report. Thank about incompetence. Later realizing the gervious errors they made instead of apologizing they made they changed my card number which was in good standing to a different number. They said they would not issue me another card, but would leave this card open for payment and if I wanted the card reinstated paperwork would follow ( which it did ) that I would have to fill out and have notary stamp and witness. This was their mistake no thank you, I do n't want any of your products. XXXX and I called Capital One weekly almost on a daily basis to get some resolve and recourse for the problem they have caused with no avail!! To add insult to injury along with no call backs from a supervisor, they are reporting me late on my credit report on a card account that does not mine. Please help me!!!

What is so wrong now is that they are literally playing games with me ... they left me a message over a week ago and I 've called that specific person back many times and she wo n't call me back ...

The letter ( and subsequent ) email which I received from them did not name the merchant involved in the data breach. When I called to find out what merchant it was they would not divulge the information and said that they had no way of knowing which merchant it was who had the data breach.

Therefore, I am charging Capital One with corporate greed, due to deceptive advertising and falsifying information. Also, their customer service personnel overseas, refer to themselves as either XXXX or XXXX from the XXXX. How can that be when they are thousands of miles away from the United States? Can I get an explanantion for that? I have stated to Capital One employees time and again, that I prefer to speak to someone in the United States.

Capital One,"I applied for a credit card from Capital One Bank ( USA ) , N.A . and was refused. The XXXX ( XXXX ) reasons they gave to refuse issuing the card were that : 1 ) "" based on my credit report from XXXX, too few or no revolving accounts have a balance. '' My letter to them informed them why that is so - "" I pay my credit card bills every month in full -- generally on the day the bill arrives in the mail. '' 2 ) "" based on your credit report from XXXX, there are too many new revolving accounts. '' My letter to them informed them that "" I have no new revolving accounts. The last account I opened was probably at least eight ( 8 ) or nine ( 9 ) months ago. And, in fact I have only XXXX ( XXXX ) revolving accounts that are in active use. '' 3 ) "" Based on your application information, income is insufficient for requested credit. '' My letter to them informed them that "" my income -- approximately XXXX per year ( I am retired ), plus having over {>= $1,000,000} cash in savings accounts -- is more than sufficient for the requested credit card. Note, too, that my credit score -- XXXX out of XXXX -- is probably higher than the majority of applicants who request, and are granted, a card from your bank. '' In short, it appears that Capital One Bank ( USA ) , N.A . is refusing to issue me a card because I pay my balance in full every month. That 's no reason to refuse to issue a card and should not be allowed. 

My credit rating is about as good as you can get, and always has been. I do n't need a Capital One Bank credit card -- in fact, I recently received in the mail an unsolicited offer from XXXX XXXX to apply for their card which I did, and was approved for immediately without issue. However, I am stunned and angry that Capital One would continue to deny me a credit card after I pointed out to them that their reasons were totally incorrect. 

That card offers several unique benefits and I want that card issued to me. 
"
Capital One,"CapitalOne has been charging me a membership fee of {$3.00} for the past 6 years. 
The customer service agents can not tell me what its for, or what benefits it provides. 
I have an identical card, but Visa branded, the one in reference is a mastercard, and it DOES NOT have this fee. 
My wife has the mastercard version and visa version, so the identical set up i have, and she DOES NOT have the fee on either account. 
The customer service folks are totally unwilling to resolve the issue or offer a VALID explanation. There is no reason i should be charged this arbitrary fee that literally does nothing. The listing of benefits for my card with the fee and my wifes identical card without the fee are identical. There is ABSOLUTELY no value from paying this fee. 

This is my OLDEST credit account and i do not want to close it, however i will happily enter in to a lawsuit just because my uncle is a lawyer and he needs to eat, if you understand me, because as he put it "" this occurrence is a cash cow ''. He seems to think that UDAAP can be invoked in this instance and wonders how much he can make from this. 

So we can go either route, drag capitalones name through the mud on social media, the traditional media ( one of my XXXX works for the XXXX in town ), the court system ( my friend from highschool works in the DA office ). 

I currently have XXXX connections on facebook on my personal page, i have over XXXX reach on my professional facebook page which is finance related, i have thousands of connections on XXXX, and i have a XXXX account for my nonprofit that is reaching XXXX followers very soon. I have no problem bringing the truth to light, i also have time as well to do all of this as i have plenty of PTO accrued. 

So will we get rid of the fee for the past 5 years? or Will we begin a journey we can not un-begin? 

Your choice, i hope you take this seriously as i have a network of individuals in XXXX who work at capitalone offices and i would hate to have to call in a favor and get them jobs elsewhere leaving you high and dry intentionally, because honestly i have that type of influence.

I refuse to make a payment for charges that are not mine and Capital One is continuing to charge interest and late fees on both accounts, in addition, these charges exceeded my credit limit by twice the amount and now Capital One is reporting this information to the Credit Bureau and it is ruining my credit because it is showing my payments are late and that I am over the limit on both credit cards. I 've reported this information to the company and yet they refuse to remove it and offer no solution.

Capital One,"I applied a Capitalone Venture One Credit card on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Before i applied, i chatted with Capital One 's online customer rep called XXXX for detailed information and benefits of this card on XXXX XXXX, 2015. During the chat, XXXX promised that I will first get XXXX miles reward if I spend {$1000.00} within 3 months and besides that another offer for XXXX rewards miles if i spend at least {$3000.00} within 3 months and he mentioned several times it is the benefits for Venture one credit card. Actually the link i used to apply for Venture One credit card was sent by XXXX and he offered me this XXXX bonus miles before I even asked for it. After the chat, I saved the chat history as a PDF proof. 

Now two months later, I have already spent more than {$3000.00}, and got the first offer of XXXX miles in my account but still have n't seen the second offer for XXXX miles so I contacted online customer rep to check if they can apply it. However, they refused the XXXX rewards miles offer and said it was just a miscommunication and ignores my online chat history as the proof. I continued to talk with customer rep supervisor XXXX but still got the same answer. I feel it is unfair that customer was told differently when tried to apply the card and after you got the card, Capital One changed their mind and refused to give you the original offer they provided, even though I have the proof of the original online chat offer history showing that I am eligible for the offer, so I would like to seek help to see anyone who can help me with this

Capital One,"I have had many credit cards and I have never experienced this. Capitol One has been charging me an "" over the limit fee '' every month, despite the fact that I pay at least the minimum payment ( {$75.00} ) and do n't use the card! They have designed their system so my account will never be paid. Every time I tell them it is illegal, they reverse the charge, but then they turn around and do it again!

I immediately called Capital One on XXXX XXXX, 2016 after receiving a phone call from XXXX asking if I had purchased a gift card online for {$100.00}. THEY ( XXXX ) recommended I contact the Capital One people to report fraud. How is it a potential charge of {$100.00} activated an alert from XXXX to contact me, but XXXX charges to XXXX company in the amount of over {$19000.00} did not alert Capital One fraud or Security! These people need to be held responsible for their lack of attention to abnormal activity on customer accounts! All I received is "" wow, we 're really sorry. How did that happen? You of course are not responsible for these charges, but Wow! You must have fallen thru the cracks ''. This attitude does not leave me with any sense of security from Capital One. I have been issued a new card.

Then in the process of using the VISA there were multiple questions on the keypad. Asking me to type in my name, asking questions about my citizenship and finally asking for my SSN. I refused to provide my SSN and they would not process my VISA. The store clerk told me it was the law and that I had to enter my SSN to use my VISA. I know that to be false but he insisted. I suspect the store had some kind of sales promotion for the checkout people and he was trying to capture my information to get the sales promotion rewards.

Capital One,"Hello My name is XXXX XXXX ; I am writing this letter as a complaint on CapitolOne Bank. I have been with this bank for about a year, not as a personal account holder but as credit card holder. I have XXXX cards from them the first I received about a year ago at {$500.00} limit ; I have no problem with that one because I always pay as schelude. The problem is with the second card I received a few months ago at a higher limit. I make it a habit to pay my bills on time and always add a few dollars more than the limit to keep my credit score at a decent rate. This Bank has deliberatly been sending bad reports on me as if am not paying them. The card in question ends in XXXX. Going back about four months ago, I miss the due date by a day and called the customer service, they agreed to drop the {$30.00} late charge but said I still have to pay XXXX dollars instead of XXXX so the system would correct itself. I paid it and taught all was well. XXXX months pass and I assume Iwas paying on time because of what was showing on my computer screen ; I normally pay on the day my payment is due because I dont have a steady job and ca n't predict what my funds will be around my due date. I never considered the time of day I pay an issue, so when I see my payment being posted for the next day I considered that a bank issue. Customer Service never explained that my payments were being counted as late and nothing on my screen was telling me either, all I was seeing was the minimum amount and due date. I missed the due date this month by a few hours and called customer service to make the payment, the person told me {$60.00} I asked if the late fee could be excused and he said yes just pay to XXXX owed which I did. The next day I check my account and there was {$90.00} charge added to my next payment I called customer service again and was told I owe this money because of pass late charges, i asked why was it not being showed on my screen up until now, they have no explination except that am behind on my payments and the its being documented on my credit report. I have decided to stop paying them anything on this card until someone outside of them looks at this situation. Am asking to please investigate this matter quickly so I can assume my payments.

Capital One,"Capital One of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX UT had reported XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to Experian Credit Bureau, that account # XXXX was not late XXXX XXXX, as Capital One had previously reported XXXX, XXXX of XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 
This inaccurate reporting effectively RE AGES the account to report past the statute of limitations for reporting to credit bureau under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

THe company requested information which I have provided to them to insure that it is me. I wanted to of course, get the card reinstated. The wo n't accept the information which is clearly correct. They claim it is a copy of a copy and they wo n't accept it. I 've had enough of the harassing and phone calls and if they ca n't accept the only things that I can provide which are indeed the right things, then I asked them to please cancel my card so that my risk of exposure for a card I ca n't even use that could cause a credit problem or more identity problems. They are refusing to close out my account or reactivate it even though I 've provided legitimate documents proving that it is me. I 'm asking for help to get this account closed and lessen my exposure top more fraud.

Capital One,"On Thursday XXXX Capital left a voicemail @ work saying to call the fraud people by calling the XXXX on the back of my card which I did today XXXX ( I was not at work ). They say there 's fraudulant activity and they have to shut my account. I asked for 24 hours so I can notify all the vendors linked to my account and they say they can not do that ; the best is the card will be frozen for all transactions. I have to answer a fraud questionnaire. Then I have to wait 5 days for a new card in the mail. 
I feel this is unfair treatment. I should be able to notify my vendors and be given new card information to work with immediately. The world does not wait for things to arrive by mail. 
lastly, the company says they can not tell me the name of the company where personal information was released because of the "" ongoing investigation. '' That 's like saying you were XXXX but you are not allowed to know who the XXXX is. 
finally, Capital one claims they called my cell phone and "" could not leave a message '' ( no reason why ) and they called a number that apparently they had on record that I had called from at one point in time. It turns out that is my BOYFRIEND 'S phone number. If that had been an ex-boyfriend that could have been dangerous for me, possibly. I do not like that they could call that number without having asked for permission to use that number. That appears predatory and beyond cautious despite some "" fraud '' that I know nothing about. I know we need to know about fraud and that they need to be careful, but this seems BEYOND careful and leaves me feeling like a victim. ] I WANT TO KNOW WHAT MY RIGHTS ARE WHEN IT COMES TO NOTIFICATION AND AFTER EFFECTS OF CREDIT CARD FRAUD.

Capital One,"On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I paid my credit card bill {$180.00} On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I received a message stating that amount was pending due to a XXXX CAPONE OTB HOLD. I called to inquire about the hold up. A supervisor stated it was because I paid my bill to often in one month, so they were placing a hold because of suspicion of fraud. They called my bank with me on the line and inquired about fraud. The bank confirmed there was no fraud. the bank further told them that the {$180.00} was released to them. They confirmed they had received the payment. After they hung from the bank the supervisor for Capital One told me she was going to keep the hold on for several more days. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 a payment of {$17.00} was allowed to go thru. This coming after a hold was placed on the {$180.00}. I told the supervisor : # 1. I suspect that there was an attempt to control my spending view slowing the process to return my credit limit to its normal amount. # 2.How is it that they were the complaint party for my bank who was not concerned with the allege fraud. She stated I should not pay my bill as often as I had. I stated I wanted to produce a good pay record to help my credit and I needed my limit restored in order to buy other goods. I informed the supervisor that I take umbrage to how she and the other employees were handling my situation. The situation being that a made up charge of fraud that the bank where i have paid all of my bills concerning capital One all of a sudden became fraudulent. I ridiculous that Capital One would investigate fraud for another institution who have their own security measures in place. This supervisor called my institution and never offered a legitimate reason for calling only saying it was a mistake that had already been resolved. It was so unbecoming of a business such as Capital One. I told her, I was offended by what they were doing that the real reason for all of this was to keep me from paying my bill so rapidly. She stated the hold would be removed but she cautioned me to not pay my bill as often.

After waiting on hold and being disconnected once, XXXX transferred me to his supervisor XXXX ( Agent ID XXXX ). XXXX told me that she would not resolve my issue, but would forward it to a department that could. She stated that it would take 30 days for me to receive a credit for the error. XXXX stated she was unable to issue a credit for the mistake or to send me a message or email confirming that the issue would be resolved. 
I also wrote a secure message to Capital One on XXXX XXXX, 2015 requesting resolution to the error, and received a generic reply on XXXX XXXX, 2015 referring me to a telephone number for the disputes department. 
I called Capital One again on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I was transferred to the dispute department and spoke to XXXX. She told me again that it would take 30 days to get a credit, and stated she could not provide a message or email confirming that the issue would be resolved. 
I closed my credit card account with Capital One at this point and paid off the remaining balance minus the {$1000.00} rebilled by Capital One to my account in error.

Today, XXXX XXXX, 2015, I attempted to sign up for online banking with Capital One and, after completing the application, was told my card was restricted. I did a bank chat and was told to call XXXX. I called the number and it was the fraud department. I was told the company determined I was not the one who opened the account ( I definitely did! ) and that my application was fraudulent. When I pressed for details, asked why they took the {$500.00} from my account and how they determined the fraudulent status without contacting me, I was told they did n't have that information. When I, again, questioned the withdrawal of {$500.00} from my account, I was told "" if you really want to get it back you need to call from your bank and have your identity proven by a bank representative. '' The phone representative was equally evasive when I asked why I had not been contacted by the bank and why the company would have send me a card if the application was deemed fraudulent. Still, no reasonable response. I was told that I could reapply if I wanted to. Needless to say, I want no further dealings with Capital One but I DO WANT MY {$500.00} DEPOSIT BACK!

She continued to just ask me if I wanted to make a payment and that they could n't retrieve my funds ... I continued over and over to ask "" WHY '' you could n't retrieve my funds. There was more than enough for the minimum payment to draft from my financial institution. Again she said that she did n't know and if I wanted to make a payment.

But, they are refusing to give us the benefit of XXXX miles per dollar for the past 6 months from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the date Capital One opened our account. This is a blatant disregard of the benefit stated in their web site. We have charged {$5000.00} on Capital One 's credit card for the past 6 months and the reward summary shows only XXXX miles in our account. Our account should show a reward of XXXX miles based upon XXXX miles per dollar.

I told the representative I wanted the account immediately closed. Over the next hour I talked to at least XXXX or XXXX people, I was disconnected XXXX times. At the end of the night XXXX assured me the account had been closed and the "" new card '' would not be sent. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received an email that stated "" your new card has been shipped via XXXX XXXX. '' I punched in the tracking number and of course CapitalOne sent it to the person who hacked my account. I called CapitalOne and asked for "" fraud ''. After speaking with the XXXX representative I discovered I was n't connected to the fraud department. I have no idea why they did n't get the telephone transfer correct. I was then connected to the fraud department - lower level person then supervisor. By the end of the conversation the representative told me the new card that was sent out had not been cancelled. He then claimed he cancelled the card. He was "" pretty sure '' no one would be able to activate the new card. However, he ( along with XXXX the night before ) was not authorized to send me an email confirming they had closed the account. I would need to wait 7 - 10 days for a letter. I have absolutely no faith that CaptialOne protects the personal information of their cardholders. This should have been a simple task and it ended up being a waste of XXXX XXXX hours of my time and a lot of frustration. If this card is activated, CapitalOne will be responsible for all of the charges. CapitalOne needs to look at the quality of their employees and how they are trained.

Capital One,"Capital One is constantly misleading consumers about low-interest promotions. 
As result, I will end up paying over 20 % interests on those old purchases, not just on the balance additional purchases at the end of the promotional period. 
The promotional notes that I received on the advertising materials do n't disclose the rate increases at all, while I 've just been contact by Capital One sharing "" good news '' stating that my account it is eligible for a lower annual percentage rate ( APR ). So, to make the notice prominent enough, Capital One is creating the "" impression '' that higher rates wo n't apply and it will go down to a standard purchase rate, but without communicating the actual rate.

Capital One,"I have a Neiman Marcus store credit card, which I believe is provided by Capital One. I enrolled in on-line statements. I have a personal shopper who occasionally orders items for me to be shipped to my home, by my request. I requested my shopper to purchase a couple clothing items for me, but they were on back order. A month or so later, the order processed and the charge was posted to my credit card account. I had completely forgotten about the order and did not access my credit card account over this period as I had not shopped at the store and was n't expecting any charges. Over this period of time I did not receive any courtesy notices that a charge had gone unnoticed or unpaid on my account. On XXXX XXXX, I received my quarterly credit monitoring report and saw that Neiman Marcus credit card had posted derogatory information about me as a late payer. I immediately logged into my NM account and saw that there was a charge that was past due. I paid the balance immediately. I was shocked that derogatory information was posted to my account without them at least once trying to contact me to remind me of the balance. AFTER that information was posted, I received ( XXXX days later after my credit monitoring report ) a past due balance reminder. At this point the damage was done. My credit score went from high XXXX 's down XXXX points. I have no other derogatory information on my credit history - nothing. I wrote to the NM credit department ( as they do not take - or apparently make - calls ). I sent them a copy of my credit report to show them that they were dealing with a person of high credit standing. They sent me a proforma letter saying they would not reverse the derogatory information. I later called customer service and closed my credit card account and they did not even ask me why. They closed it in about XXXX seconds. I refuse to let this go without them removing the derogatory information and changing their collection practices to include a reminder before submitting derogatory information.

Capital One,"For the second time this year, my Capital One credit card has been compromised by a breach in a merchant system. In the first instance, I asked if Capital One could give me additional information for my own protection, as I would like to make a decision about whether and how I continue to do business with a merchant with potential security issues. They refused, citing an "" ongoing investigation. '' Due to the circumstances, I was able to determine the merchant on my own ( family and friends ' cards were compromised as well ), and I was eventually notified by the merchant. I never received additional information from Capital One. This same problem has happened again, and while I realize there may be extenuating circumstances that need to be sorted out, I believe it 's a consumer 's right to know the identity of a company whose security was breached, potentially impacting their personal and financial information. Capital One informed me today that it is the merchant 's decision whether or not to make the information public and notify customers. What are my rights as a consumer in this circumstance?

I received the necessary funds to repay the full balance of the cash advance and called to get the I formation on how to do this. When speaking to the representative, I asked him what the procedure was to accomplish this as I have always been able to do this in the past with other credit cards. "" XXXX '' the representative insisted that this was not possible and stated that the payments are always applied to the lowest interest rate XXXX and then they would go to the highest interest rate charges after all of the other balances were paid XXXX. This is totally unacceptable and potentially criminal! So what they are telling me is that I will be paying 30 % on the cash advance until I pay my entire balance in full?!? I told the rep that what he was saying was wrong and he proceded to tell me that they ( Capital One XXXX WOULD not help me. I have already been charged XXXX separate {$10.00} cash advance fees, which I understood and acknowledged before I made the withdrawals, but what he is saying was rediculous!

They would not give me any more details, such as who they allegedly contacted or why they called that person when I had n't even received or activated my card yet. Of course I was never contacted by Capital One, only gave my contact information in the application and did apply for the card. There was no fraud involved in my application and if they claim there is I believe I should be informed of the circumstances.

I applied for a card, was told I was approved for it ( and indeed received it ) and then had my account shut down without any explanation before I could even activate it.

Capital One,"This complaint refers to a specific recurring issue regarding the manner in which Capital One processes payments. My due date to pay my credit card bill is on the XXXX of the month with no grace period. However, payments actually made on the due date incur a significant late fee because Capital One says payments made that day are "" processed '' and then posted the next day. 

They claim a cut off of XXXX eastern time in terms of processing payments made that day. My contention, and I was told by the customer service person that this is a common complaint, is that if I make a payment on that date, whether it is early in the day or XXXX minute prior to XXXX, should be accounted for that day. Their policy, somehow written into the credit card agreement and no doubt buried somewhere in the mountain of fine print typical of cc agreements, is an absurd and egregious money grab. 

I asked that my credit card account and all billing issues be frozen until this matter was resolved and was refused. Also, credit card companies should be held accountable for these kinds of anti consumer practices. Some of us are smart enough to know that they have armies of lobbyists who allow them to get away with sticking it to us with crazy fees and penalties for the smallest mistake, but this is no mistake. If my due date is the XXXX and I pay on the XXXX, I should not be penalized regardless of their internal policy, accounting or cut off time. In fact, the cut off time should be moved to the XXXX to allow time for processing payments that were made on the XXXX.

Capital One,"I have received at least XXXX solicitations for a balance transfer from CapitalOne over the past several weeks. I decided to accept their offer onXX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX.

When I called them, they cut me off XXXX before asking me aseries of questions, which had no answer from a representative whodid not have a capable command of the XXXX language. Questionsincluded the age of my father, which I answered correctly, a car that Iowned XX/XX/XXXX, which I answered correctly, and towns where I lived, which did not exist ( e.g. XXXX, NJ-there is no town called XXXX, NJ, I did tell them that I lived in XXXX County, NJ at some point, whichserved to confused the issue ).

Capital One,"I have a credit card account with Capital One. My payments are due by the XXXX of the month and typically Capital One will report account information to the credit bureaus a few days after the payment is due each month. This is what occurred this month on approximately XXXX/XXXX/2015, when my account was updated to reflect the payments made and my balance reflected {$130.00}. I then made another payment which posted on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Capital One did not update my payment history after that payment. However, there was an issue with my bank and the payment was returned ( and subsequently resubmitted after the error was corrected ). I checked my credit report today and Capital One has now updated my XXXX report to reflect the balance of the returned payment even though they had already updated the reporting of the account at the beginning of the month to reflect my payments at that time which cleared with no problem. Consequently, this update caused a nearly XXXX point drop in my credit score. It is very clear that Capital One is electing to report the account at various times with the intent of penalizing me. They did n't choose to update the reporting when my balance was even lower yet they are choosing to do so when the payment was returned. This clearly shows that they are intentionally trying to damage my credit rating in an effort to have me resolve the returned payment ( which I have already done anyway ). This is not the XXXX time they have reported multiple times in a month. The account should be reported after the payment is due and not report again until the following month 's payment is due, which is accurate information. Had I not resolved the issue with the returned payment by my next billing cycle, then Capital One would have every reason to report it in this manner, however, they are opting to do so now before the billing cycle is complete in an effort to intentionally damage my credit rating and to penalize me. I am applying for a mortgage at this time and now have been denied credit due to this.

Capital One,"I recently received an offer in the mail for XXXX XXXX credit card. A major feature of this card is to "" Earn XXXX miles per {$1.00} spent on every purchase ''. Unfortunately, this is a false and deceptive statement. The brochure explains that I use the credit card to book a flight on my own, then go to their rewards center to redeem my miles, which will apply a credit for that flight. It turns out that a "" mile credit '' does NOT result in a credit towards a flight mile. Instead, it is just a XXXX penny credit towards my flight purchase. These are very different things! For example, suppose I make {$100.00} in credit card charges and earn XXXX miles. If I then use my card to book a XXXX mile flight, say for {$50.00}, they will NOT credit my account for {$50.00} as directly implied in their brochure. Instead, they will only credit me for XXXX CENTS!

Capital One,"About XXXX years ago, i received a credit card of {$300.00} issued by HSBC, with 0 % financing for a year. I purchased insurance on the account, as I was afraid of being layed off ( I am an older worker ). I was told at the time, by phone, by the insurance company and HSBC, that if I became unemployed, the insurance would pay off my account. A month or two later, I was layed off due to my illness, and initiated the program, providing the information needed to both companies. When I returned to work XXXX months later, the program ended, and when I checked my balance, I still owed about {$300.00}. When I inquired with the insurance, they claimed that they payed out around {$30.00} a month for nine months, or around {$270.00}. When i inquired about the account with HSBC, they said they dropped the interest rate when they froze the account. Now if the insurance company was paying at least the minimum on the account, why did the HSBC change the interest rate without informing me? This product was sold to me with the intention of preserving my credit by paying on this account, and was misrepresented by both parties involved. To make this story worse, HSBC was bought by Capitol One. I discovered this after I got a call from Capitol One saying I need to send a payment on my account. I told them, I do n't have a Capitol One account, wherein they told me that my account was purchased by HSBC. I told them of the problems with HSBC, and they told me, that they had no idea where that money went, but that Capitol One purchased the account. I told them that I have already paid via my insurance on that account, and the amount owed should have been less than a XXXX bucks, not the {$300.00} they claim as the balance. They claimed to know nothing about my situation, so I tell them I am not paying them money I do not owe. Flash forward to today : its been years since that conversation, Capitol One has accessed late fees on a credit card account I do not own. This was then turned over to an odious collection agency called XXXX XXXX, after upping the ante from {$300.00} to {$500.00}. I have told these people for years I am not paying them, and will not. I may one day settle this, but its not going to be for {$300.00} or {$500.00}, it will be for the amount owed on the original account, minus the amount paid by the insurance. In the years between, I have purchased cars, and other items with credit, paying them off in a timely manner. Recently, I have left work again, due to my health problems, and have related this to XXXX XXXX, who still wants to collect for Capitol One. They wanted me to put an account of this in writing to them, but I have instead opted to put an account of this in writing to you, in the hopes you will forward the complaint to both Capitol One and XXXX XXXX. If my failing health and employment issues do not sway them to write this off, then the next window to conclude this chapter is XXXX 2016, when I file and receive my meager income tax return, wherein I will offer again, to pay the original amount due, minus the money paid by my insurance to whoever is collecting it.

It makes me wonder how many other consumers are being charged this fee unaware they are paying for it.

Capital One,"To Whom It May Concern, Good morning. Please, I am seeking help with inquiring into a balance that has become outstanding with the company Capital One. 
I opened this account 14 years ago in XX/XX/XXXX. It was my very first account to begin a credit history and this during my enrollment into college. I have diligently paid on this account and never in any lien for 14 years. I have already paid off the student loans years ago because their interest practices were subsequently fair. 
I have opened other accounts over the years ( car insurance, other emergency credit cards, etc. ) All United States companies. Every other interest-based company I 've ever dealt with in United States has, following my establishing a good payment standing, automatically lowered my variable-interest rates ( not my credit limit ) or continued seeking ways to offer me waived potential fees ( such as removing inflated operating fees ), to reward my good payment history, help pay principal and keep me as a customer. They would seemingly also do these so their federal and consumer-protection practices remained compliant. 
During all these events, I have never once for 14 years, been offered any reductions or adjustments or anything offered from Capital One. I understand it was my first card years ago. But, the APR is not fixed. Interest raised the principal to the point where I could not easily transfer the balance years ago. I then tried to stop the card. The majority of my current balance with them is purely, once again, interest. I have not encountered this with other non-fixed APR-based companies. Over {$1000.00} from multiple interest and other fees accumulates every 11 months for years now. Although, I had never made lengthy late payments to warrant it and maintained a XXXX FICO score all years leading to this. 
Please see then also attachment. The balance reflects not the small total purchases made with this card annually, but reflects totals largely derived from interest. 
The only reprieve came when current federal administration stimulus plan lowered and capped rates on existing accounts following the banking, automotive and housing bailouts of recent years. But, it was short-term. The administration 's regulations on banking expired ( seemed not more than 6-9months ) and the interest rate resumed. 
So, please I would request assistance because I do not know how to address the matter. Thank you. Please, I would like to inquire for any help checking into the matter, especially ( but not limited to ) of certain interest policies with the company Capital One. Thank you so much for any help you can provide.

After complaining to capitol one directly about the extraordinary extra charges that they were putting on my account and would not work with me, I stopped paying on the account and allowed it to go into charge off state and avoided paying it while they charged interest and charged it off at {$700.00}. 
XXXX XXXX I received an additional account on my credit report from around the same time in XXXX that I was not financially responsible for. I contacted capitol one and asked for this to be removed and filed a complaint with them. They in turn sent me paperwork saying that it was correct and it was from my XXXX XXXX account and not the one that I was n't financially responsible for. After consulting with a few different agency and them putting inquiries on my credit report I finally located XXXX that was willing to sit down and help me. 
I contacted capitol one in XXXX XXXX and asked for the account that I was not responsible for to be removed from my credit report and to make a settlement with the other. Capitol one agreed to remove the other from my report and sent me an email with the settlement offer of {$450.00} and the account is considered settled and no further collection efforts would be made. I am under the understanding that once I paid this, the account would show closed and {$0.00} balance with it automatically being removed from my report due to age in XXXX XXXX. 
I went back to the person that agreed to help me and we got online and filed disputes with all XXXX credit bureau in regard to the above accounts. After the disputes were made capitol one removed the account that I was not financially responsible for reluctantly. They also showed my original capitol one account still being in collections/charge off state with a balance now of {$250.00}. I disputed this account AGAIN with the credit bureau 's and provided a PDF of the settlement agreement. Capitol one submitted their claim and denied my dispute. Now I am contacting CFPB for help on this matter

Capital One,"I had a dispute with a merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked them to stop charging my credit card I had on file as they do not have a way for me to cancel my credit card on their website. I called and advised I do not want their services and to stop automatically billing my master card. They said the would take care of it when I called but said they would not provide me with any confirmation coded as they do n't do that, just an internal note on my account. To make sure my card would not get billed again I canceled that card and was issued a new card number from capital one. As soon as I activated the card this merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX got my new card number without me giving it them and billed my new card. I call capital one and was told they did not give out the information and that master card provided them with the new information. I had to completely close my credit card account. I was not aware anyone can obtain new credit card numbers without the customers connect. I should have the right to stop a billing of a merchant on a credit card if that is what I choose and master card should not have the authority to provide my new car numbers without my authorization. Having to close my account has caused harm to me by hurting my credit score.

Capital One,"Capital One charged me interest and late fees on top of an annual fee XXXX {$59.00} XXXX for a credit card. They reported me to the Credit Bureau for not paying the {$59.00}, but also reported me for fees and interests ( {$26.00} XXXX for a total of {$82.00}. Charging interest and fees on top of an annual fee is illegal. Supporting documentation is attached. Because I am refinancing my home, the ding on my credit hurt me. They said they would fix it, but that it would take 30-60 days for the Credit to be repaired. Since interest rates are rising, I might now qualify for a lower interest rate now due to the ding on my credit, which could cost me thousands of dollars in the end. I asked for a letter stating the matter had been reversed with the Credit Bureau but they would n't give me one.

Capital One,"I am being asked to pay a vendor directly for an airline ticket I purchased on XXXX XXXX with my Capitol One card, because Capitol One charged back the {$1200.00} cost of the airline ticket. I have already paid Capitol One for the airline ticket when I paid off my XX/XX/XXXX balance in full ( {$2600.00} ) on XXXX XXXX. I have a record of this transaction on my bank statement, but I can not access my credit card statements because my card is under investigation for fraud. The vendor is asking for proof I have paid from Capitol One, but Capitol One will not give me any proof because of the investigation. Capitol One has told me verbally that they will contact the vendor, but I do n't have any confirmation that they will do so. 

Regarding the Fraud investigation, I have already been on a conference call with Capitol One with my sister XXXX because we believe the source of this issue is that there has been a mix-up with our information. After learning that my card had been closed, XXXX shared with me a letter she received a to her home address in XXXX, XXXX, informing her that she had opened a Capitol One account. XXXX called Capitol One to report that she did not open an account - I opened a Capitol One card in my name with my information, but she received a letter to her address to her name. I live in XXXX, XXXX and did not receive such a letter. 

Here are the outstanding issue that need an immediate response:1. Paid Statement : Vendors are contacting me via phone and email regarding payment for charges I have already paid to Capitol One, such as a travel agency for the {$1200.00} airline ticket. The charge for this flight was on my XX/XX/XXXX billing statement ( XXXX XXXX ), which again, I paid the balance off in full and shows up on my bank statement. Capitol One needs to pay the vendors with the money I have given them when I paid off my balance in full. 

2. Unpaid Statement : I received a paper statement for XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX with an outstanding balance of {$1300.00}. I can not access this information online, because my account has been closed. Vendors from this statement period have contacted me about payment. Please confirm XXXX things : a. If I pay this balance, will the vendors on this statement be paid? 
b. If I can not pay off this statement balance because the account is under investigation, will it be considered a late payment? Will I be charged interest? I have the means and intention to pay off all outstanding balances in full. 

3. Confirm that the investigation is underway and a time frame for when it will be resolved. I was told that it would take up to two weeks for an investigator to be assigned to the case, which was opened on XXXX XXXX but it has been more than two weeks, and as of today, XXXX XXXX Capitol One said an investigator has not yet been assigned to the case. 

How is it that my sister 's contact information is linked with mine? When I called Capitol One today, they said that the number they had on file to reach me at ended in XXXX. That is my sister 's phone number. My phone number ends in XXXX. I am dismayed that the investigation is not yet underway even though it has been more than XXXX weeks since the case was opened.

Capital One,"Someone unbeknownst to me submitted an application for a Capital One card. Evidently it was sent out, although it was not received by me, and someone used it. I reported the fraud as soon as I received information that the card was issued and in use and told them to cancel the card immediately. Unfortunately they did not, claiming that someone called afterwards claiming to be me and they kept the card open, permitting someone to charge an additional {$700.00}, and after a XXXX call, the card was closed. However, Capital One decided that I am responsible even though I repeatedly told them that I did not request, receive or use the card. Calls were not returned, dunning calls are constant, and they keep sending statements. I contacted an attorney who sent a letter, and they completely ignored it, admitting that they have no application proving I requested the card, yet keep insisting that I pay the balance that keeps increasing each month. I have placed a complaint with the FTC as well, but they said that they do n't do anything for me. My phone number has been spoofed and seems to be used for robocalls as well as trying to get credit cards ( Capital One states that they know that the calls came from our home phone even though they ca n't send me proof, and even if they had it what would it prove since I have put in complaints to XXXX? ). XXXX had called prior to Capital One asking if I had requested a card or was it fraud - not sure why, but I told them that I did not ask for nor did I want a XXXX XXXX, and none was issued.

They insisted that I send them certified copies of the letters of appointment, which I have done, but they still refuse to address this issue. Under Iowa law, the ward does not have the legal authority to enter into a credit card agreement and in this case I caught it before the card was ever used. However, Capital One keeps telling me that I, as conservator, do n't have the authority to cancel this.

Capital One,"I wanted to share a complaint I have made to the CEO of Capital One. I have a XXXX Platinum that I am fighting to have fraudulent charges removed from my account and wanted to make you aware that clearly even though they are backed XXXX, they do not employ zero fraud liability. I 'm being held responsible for 90 days for these charges. Feel free to contact me further to discuss this matter. 
Hello XXXX XXXX, I wanted to bring an important matter to your attention about XXXX of my XXXX capital one cards. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 my car was broken into and I immediately reported my XXXX card stolen. At the time of my call, XXXX charges had been fraudulently made. XXXX charges were made at the same location, XXXX XXXX in the amounts of {$200.00} and {$210.00}. The representative said that the charges would be credited to my account within XXXX hours and new cards would be issued. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX charges posted to my account. I placed a call back and spoke to a Fraud specialist. She stated to me that the reason the charges posted were because at the time I called they were "" pending ''. During that same phone call, I also gave the police report number as well as the phone numbers to the police station and burglary department. She then issued a credit for XXXX charges which cleared my account quickly on XXXX/XXXX/15. 
On XXXX XXXX, I got an email stating that my account was over the limit by {$7.00}. I was puzzled because the limit for that card is {$1000.00} and at the time of the email only had a balance of {$460.00}. Earlier that morning I used the XXXX to pay my XXXX bill which was only {$130.00} which should have left me with an available balance of {$400.00}. So my husband called customer service and was connected with a Fraud Supervisor. The supervisor indicated that yes we were over our limit because the charges we had reported fraudulent were frozen to our account for 90 days until the investigation could be completed. So my question to you is, how does your company declare ZERO fraud liability when we are still being held responsible for these charges we did n't make? 
My husband and I have XXXX lines of credit totally to {$3800.00} and have nearly perfect payment history with Capital One. After going through this process, it 's clear to us that customer loyalty means nothing and so once this investigation is resolved we will be closing all XXXX of our accounts and taking our business elsewhere. I will also be filing this same complaint with the FTC and Attorney General as well as with XXXX. 
I 'm happy to discuss this with your or one of your associates further if you wish. 
Respectfully, XXXX XXXX

Capital One,"I contacted my credit card company ( Cap One ) to report fraud. It was n't until I let them know I knew about the CFPB to report a complaint that they finally addressed my concern. However, I received a rebel for the exact reason for which I filed a complaint. I received a message from someone in their dispute resolution team and after XXXX messages/phone calls I have yet to receive any explanation or assistance from them.

Capital One,"XXXX I received a paper application from Capital One XXXX XXXX Signature card stating that I was pre-approved. I called the company to ask whether there would be a hard credit pull. I asked this because I have excellent credit and intend to keep it that way. The phone representative guaranteed me that there would be no hard credit pull since I was pre-approved, and that would be true whether the application was via snail mail, online, or by phone. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I applied online and received the card soon afterwards. I have always paid in full on time. After checking my credit report, I realized that Capital One had gone against its verbal promise and issued a hard credit pull. I called the company and made a complaint, requesting that the hard credit pull be removed as promised. The issue was forwarded to a representative named XXXX. He called me on XXXX stating that the company was not able to trace my phone call, that there is fine print stating a credit check will be performed on all online applications, and that Capital One would be unable to remove the credit pull. I told him that his results were unacceptable, asked him to recheck the phone records, and gave him a home phone number to check even though I believe I made the phone call from my cell phone. 
I am asking that the hard credit pull be removed and that Capital One train their representatives to avoid this situation in the future.

Capital One,"I Contacted Capital One, Account number ****************. The account had fallen delinquent due to job loss. On XX/XX/2015, I offered to pay off the account for less than full balance. Capital One offered an amount of {$2000.00} as a settlement amount. I agreed and paid same in XXXX installments of {$340.00} and {$1700.00}. Final payment on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Capital One has failed to contact/report these payments to the credit bureaus with arrogance. They now say it is settled but the remaining balance is still reflected on the reports, with no reporting of the agreement or my payments reflected accordingly. Capital One says now, give us the remaining balance of {$880.00} and we 'll take it off. That was not the agreement. Capital One is using deceptive/fraudulent business practices with not only me, but I am sure millions of others. Why would I give these people anymore money at this point? Please investigate.

Capital One,"On XXXX/XXXX/15 I bought a plane ticket through XXXX. They immediately sold my order to a company called XXXX. XXXX booked my ticket with XXXX XXXX. The company that charged my Capital One credit card was XXXX. 

I booked the ticket to conduct XXXX in XXXX and XXXX. The ticket was a multi-city roundtrip ticket. The outbound flight was XXXX to XXXX ( XXXX ). The return flight was XXXX ( XXXX ) back to XXXX. 

On XXXX/XXXX/15, I received a phone call from informing me that a Memorial Service had been scheduled for my Great Uncle, who had died previous to me purchasing the ticket ( his kids had n't scheduled the service until then ). The Memorial was to be held in XXXX XXXX, XXXX right before I was to leave for XXXX. 

I called XXXX to switch my outgoing departure airport from XXXX to any XXXX airport so that I could attend the Service. They told me this would n't be a problem. But they said I had to work through XXXX to process the bereavement waiver. 

I contacted XXXX and worked with them for several weeks, sending emails and making countless phone calls. They eventually forwarded the death certificate and relevant documents to XXXX. I spoke to several XXXX agents who told me that they had granted the exchange/refund waiver according to their bereavement policy. But they needed XXXX to call their Online Travel Company Waiver Department to retrieve my waiver code. 

XXXX told me that they were unable to make outgoing phone calls and that XXXX needed to call them. So I called XXXX back and explained the situation. XXXX 's waiver department was also unable to make outgoing phone calls. So even though they had granted the waiver, these XXXX giant corporations refused to call each other in order to process the waiver. 

I was stuck in the middle of this. I even offered to facilitate a conference call to put these XXXX companies ' waiver processing departments on the phone at the same time. But XXXX insisted the phone call must be placed by XXXX directly. 

I called Capital One to challenge this charge, as XXXX was unable to process the waiver that they agreed to grant do to their inability to make an outgoing phone call. 

Capital One facilitated a 3-way call with XXXX. XXXX said they were willing to grant the waiver, but asked if I could resend the death certificate and supporting documents. I faxed it to them, and have a fax receipt to prove it. But they still did n't issue a refund. 

I called Capital One again to formally contest the charge. Capital One granted me an immediate credit of the full amount of the ticket - {$1300.00}. 

On XXXX XXXX, Capital One contacted me to say that XXXX had responded to the complaint. According to Capital One, XXXX claimed that my XXXX ticket was non-refundable. 

This is false. I originally booked my ticket through XXXX, not XXXX. I never agreed to buy a non-refundable ticket through XXXX. But most importantly, XXXX had already agreed to grant me a bereavement waiver. The problem was that they could n't make an outgoing phone call to XXXX. 

Capital One asked me to send them documentation of this. I uploaded my documentation to their website prior to the deadline. 

On XXXX XXXX, I received a phone call from Capital One supervisor XXXX ( Employee ID : XXXX ). He said they could do nothing because XXXX had claimed the ticket was nonrefundable. 

I reminded XXXX that XXXX had granted a refund. XXXX looked into it and called me back that same day. He said they had run out of time to forward the refund request to XXXX. Since Capital One had n't forwarded this request by the deadline. If they had processed the documentation sooner, I would have been fine. But they failed to meet their own deadlines. I can not be held responsible for their failure to forward this.

Capital One,"I have been receiving "" 0 % for 18 months '' offers from Capital One, with whom I hold a card. This is an offer no one would take if they read carefully. After paying 3 % to use their "" 0 % check '' or making a balance transfer, the rate on the entire account goes to 17.9 % if you make a purchase using the card. I think they are counting on people not reading carefully and/or not understanding the offer -- or on accidentally using the card for a purchase. May be legal, but very shifty. 
"
Capital One,"I opened up this credit card in 2008. I have never been late on a payment. The majority of this debt was consolidated date because I had a 7.79 percent rate on this card. I always paid double the amount of the min payment. This last year I have been working hard to get other debt with higher interest rates paid off so I reduced my payment to the minimum on this capital one card. My payment was {$250.00}. I went out of town for a period of time in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and my bank makes the payments automatically. Unbeknownst to me the min payment went up {$3.00}. So in XX/XX/XXXX they received {$250.00} instead of {$250.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX ( I was out of town and did not know it was {$3.00} short ) They received {$250.00} instead of {$250.00}. I got back and realized they have raised my APR from 7.79 % to 24.99 % over a shortage of {$3.00}. I called and asked them to reduce it back considering my history of never being late and simply because it was not ethical to raise the APR to 24.99 %. I will never get out of debt paying this rate. I spoke to XXXX different people over a period of 3 hours. The last person XXXX ID # XXXX basically said she knew and understood what had happened and she knows what I want ... to have the rate lowered back to the original..but she WAS NOT DOING IT. It is not a matter of the dollar amount agreeing that {$3.00} was a meager amount to be short but rather that I was short twice and that it was not worth saving a good customer over {$3.00}. She was a horrible customer service rep. I wonder if Capital One really does not value good customers as she portrays. I want the interest rate reduced back to what I deserve having always paid on time. I was not "" Late '' on a payment I was short {$3.00}. That does not warrant raping me financially. I owe Capital One {$15000.00}. They stand to make a lot of money over a {$3.00} mistake and this should not happen much less be legal business practice.

This month we got a bill again for {$100.00}, I called again, they will not close the account unless we provide them with all the information needed to open an account, NO WE WILL NOT GIVE THEM SS #, BIRTHDAY, FULL ADDRESS, so they can build an account? They hung up refusing to pull up the account with the account number, last digits and year of birth, so we have never had a card, never bought a thing, and they had negative information on the credit and a bill of {$100.00} that is growing by late fees and interest AND WE ARE NOT THEIR CUSTOMER. WE BOUGHT NOTHING. WE HAD NO IDEA FOR THE LAST 7 YEARS THAT THE ACCOUNT WAS OPEN. I want the negative information removed, not shown as paid but shown as charged without permission, and the account closed. NOW. I am thinking of buying a car and I want this removed, without having to provide them with any of my personal information because I never provided it to them in the first place. The CAP ONE XXXX attachment is the "" other '' account that apparently was opened a month after the account in protest, the reporting in erroneous as well, we never had a card or made any transactions as soon as we found out about it, we closed it, we never knew about this one until last month.

Capital One,"I opened a credit card account with Capital One. I chose Venture card as it was the most attractive option for me. The most attractive feature of the card was the lack of foreign transaction fee because I 'm often overseas for work and other matters. 

When I applied everything went without a hitch, and I was approved instantly as I have an excellent credit rating. But when I tried to activate the card, the card was "" frozen '' for fraud alert -- I 'm not sure why that was the case since nobody from Capital One bothered to tell me despite my numerous requests -- and Capital One asked for my ID, SSN card and some kind of statements, etc. to prove that I 'm who I am. I was advised that it 'd take XXXX business hours. 

It 's been more than three business days. Nobody has any answers for me. XXXX of the reps promised to call me with an update, but they never did. I presume they have the recording of our calls. Their online help on XXXX is also unhelpful. 

If Capital One was worried about my identity, it should 've asked me to submit all the documents, etc. when I applied, NOT after I already got the card. Furthermore, I detest the way the representatives from Capital One would n't tell me anything, treating me like I 'm a scammer, despite the fact that I had to verify my date of birth, SSN and other information provided at the time of application. According to them, scammers know a lot of information about their victims. If so, they did they accept my application and approve it? 

I 'm currently overseas right now. I was hoping to be able to use the card and take advantage of no foreign transaction fee, but apparently that 's not going to happen. 

I also was n't given any promise that their system is secure and that my ID and other documents provided to them to verify that I am who I am wo n't be stolen off their server.

I was told by Capitol One when I complained, '' Well we actually changed the time from XXXX EST to XXXX EST because we were getting so many complaints. '' HOW can they charge people a late fee when the payment is made before XXXX on the date it is due? This to me is extortion and should be illegal.

Years later I get a call from a collection agency. I kept hanging up because as far as I knew I did n't owe anyone a dime. Then I got a collection letter about a capital one debt ( my exact balance owed when I closed the account : XXXX dollars. ) I called capital one to pay the debt. The girl I spoke with said she saw the note indicating I requested to pay the account in full and close it. Yet somehow they never processed my payment! She transferred me to the collections rep and I immediately paid in full. This NEVER should have happened. I never got a single statement nor phone call from capital one about this. My number has n't changed in over a decade. They could have told me about THEIR mistake any time.

Capital One,"Recently I contacted my credit card Capital One to find out how much the minimum amount was due for payment and was told that {$120.00} would suffice. Once I paid the bill a few weeks later I had a family emergency where my dogs XXXX was XXXX and we raced to the hospital to tend to him. At the time I needed gas so that I could return back with the family and I had my sister and my XXXX mother in the car with me. Over the internet the credit card indicated that I had monies available. To our shock and surprise, the card was declined because I later found out that there was a hold on the credit card. I can not explain the weight of how embarrassed and mortified I was in front of my family and the gas station attendant. Why would the Capital One website indicate that monies were available? To add insult to injury, the customer service representatives were clearly unfazed by my plea and situation. They were rude, unprofessional, abrupt and quickly disconnected the call. Prior to the disconnect, I was also told that I had to pay an additional {$75.00} with no explanation. At this point, the responses I received were callus, rude and abrupt. No one ever explained where this amount came from however when I checked back and got a supervisor I was told that I did n't owe {$75.00} because the money was waived for some odd reason. I am still unaware why I was charged initially and why it was waived. Maybe it waived due to the cruel and horrible treatment I received. To date, I needed the monies for food for my family since the amount available had changed from gas money to {$59.00} being available. Realizing that this company communicates one thing and is not always forthcoming, I decided to contact them before I embarrass myself it I used the card and it was declined. Now I am being told that I need to pay {$24.00} because when I previously paid {$120.00} I needed to pay {$140.00}. Why was n't this information made available to me previously? Why was I charged {$75.00} and then it was waived? Why does it say that I have available credit over the internet and phone line when the card has a freeze/hold on it? This company is unethical, unprofessional and constantly misinforming me regarding my bill. I have no idea what is going on and they need to stop. What 's in my wallet is nothing because I am constantly being mislead by a heartless company that refuses to make any exceptions to life 's situations.

Capital One,"I have an account with Capital One and we receive a bill in the mail every month. There were a couple of months where we did n't receive a bill and made our payment late. Capital One reported our account 30 days past due on several occasions. I have sent them a couple of letters pursuant to the Fair Credit Billing Act to verify that my payment posted past the 30 day mark and I have not heard anything back. The only response we received was a letter requesting the account number which was already provided.

Capital One,"I 'll begin by saying this is n't a duplicate complaint to any other complaints I may have had in the past. I ask that you do n't claim this complaint as a duplicate from any older complaints because it 's not. 

Due to health issues I tried my best to settle this with Capital One but I was given the run around and clearly lied to more than once. I 'll begin by saying Capital One put me on some XXXX XXXX XXXX of theirs without my consent. The program consists of the customer making XXXX on time payments to their accounts of the minimum payment due in which I 've made more than XXXX payments and I 've paid much more than the minimum with each payment I 've made since XX/XX/XXXX which is also when Capital One put me on their XXXX without me knowing. I was told when I make the last payment my credit limit would be increased to {$1000.00}. As I 've stated I 've made more than XXXX payments already yet Capital One has refused to increase my credit limit to the {$1000.00} credit line and it 's not right which makes me further consider not doing business with Capital One any longer because I have health issues and I do n't need any stress from a company about something they promised me. On Tuesday XXXX I spoke to a Supervisor. He tells me my credit limit wo n't be increased until XX/XX/XXXX. I told him that 's not right I have to wait until XXXX XXXX when I 've made XXXX payments already. I also have proof regarding the higher credit limit offered by Capital One which I 'll include with my complaint. 

I have medication that I pay for monthly that I intended to use my card for when the increase was done but now there is a chance I have to wait until XX/XX/XXXX just to pay for my medication and I should n't have to wait that long. Capital One is the one that put me in their XXXX XXXX program because I 've never heard of it until I called yet now they wo n't Honor what they offered. Rather they are able to just add you to any of their programs or not they should send customers something a letter, by mail, or by email because it 's no way they can say they ca n't contact any of their customers to at least let them know what is going on when anything is done with their accounts.

I found that way reasonable though bank is still 30min drive from my house. today I went to their nearest branch in XXXX, XXXX and the lady had called at the given number but their card representative said I still need to send these copies via email/fax to them and they can not verify my identity and my wife 's identity without getting copies our social security and driving license via fax/email. 
My complaint is 1- what makes them feel after so many years that we are not the right account holder2- why they can not verify our identity when we went in person with all documentation to their branch as per their supervisor instruction? 
3- Now, I have decided to close my account with them after getting last statement but upon asking to give my earned rewards back they said I can not get those unless account is reactivated and for that I must have to follow their instruction. the only reason for closing my account is that i dont want to send copies of my secure information to anyone for this simple transactions based issue. and they wont release my earned reward which I earned after so many spending 's unless I send these.

This caused my Kohl 's payment to bounce and I went past due because they had the wrong phone number on file for me and could not reach me. Since I live in the XXXX, I only get my mail weeks later. When I found out about the issue, I immediately made payment and advised Kohl 's of the bank issue. I disputed this with Kohl 's and they refused to fix it. I had my bank send them a letter explain that it was not my fault. I thought that with this letter Kohl 's would have cleared up the matter, but I just pulled my report and it is still on there. When I called Kohl 's they said that even though I attempted to and had all intentions of paying and was victim of a bank error, they will not correct my credit bureau. I am not asking anyone to fix something that was my fault. If XXXX bank causes an issue, that should count. They claim they are not permitted to change the reporting unless it was their error. I just do n't believe that is a fair practice and I suspect that is not a rule they apply consistently because others, report on line that having proof of a bank error should and does result in the credit bureau being corrected.

I have tried to resolve this many times with management but was told every time a manager was not available and can only speak with a supervisor. I was also clearly told by a representative Capital one would resolve and this would not report negatively on my credit report.

Capital One,"capital one said this was an interest free credit card, that i got through XXXX as an employee, now they are charging me interest on the credit card 
"
Capital One,"I have had the account with Capital One for more than 10 years. I always pay on time and more than the amount due. It is business card. This past year I was late twice - inadvertently - I called as soon as I realized it and paid up, again more than was due. Capital One has raised my rate from 6 % to 24 % due to late bills in the past year. I tried to get them to see I was a good customer for a long time, but I was told "" If you are late twice, we have the right to raise your rate, and we do n't have to take into consideration if you are good customer or not. '' I was told that they could reduce my interest rate after 12 months of on time payments. This would cost me {$4000.00} to get back in their good graces. This may be legal, but it is still wrong. 
"
Capital One,"Capitol One keeps reinserting a delinquent account that I was an authorized borrower on. They are reporting it as a joint account and it was never a joint account. I have a current capitol One account that has never been late. 
"
Capital One,"For several months XX/XX/XXXX I did not receive statements on my Capital One credit card. I was on the phone monthly trying to resolve the issue with them. They blamed the XXXX Postal service, but I believe the issue was with Capital One. Their representatives assured me that my payments would not be treated as late because I did not have statements to pay from. As soon as I received a statement, I paid it and even did a couple of wire transfers. Recently I discovered that they reported a late payment for XXXX XXXX. I have NEVER had a late payment in my XXXX years of credit card use and this should NOT be on my record since I did not have statement to pay from. Dating back to XXXX XXXX, I have contacted them several times to have this removed from my credit report. They agreed when on the phone but they never sent the update to the credit bureaus. Today, I conferenced XXXX and Capital One on the phone. During that call, Capital One stated that they never sent those updates to remove that from my record and that they were not going to. So, for months Capital One representatives have been lying to me. During my calls, they would never put anything in writing for me because of "" policy, '' but I see now it was because they were flat out lying. A "" Late Payment '' should NOT be on my credit report record because of Capital One 's issue with statement processing. This is the only blemish on my XXXX years of credit and I was NOT late. THIS IS WRONG! They are a terrible company. 
"
Capital One,"I have requested a lower APR from Capital One three times and continue to be turned down. Capital One continues to keep me at what is considered a penalty rate. 
"
Capital One,"I called Capital One last month to pay off my account in full. The customer service rep gave me a figure, I paid it and intended to close the account. This month I got a new bill, with the interest amount accrued during the billing cycle before I paid off the card. I have since paid this ( very small ) interest amount and closed my account. I believe the customer service rep should have provided the total of that additional amount due when I called last month, especially since I informed him I intended to close the account. In my experience, Capital One takes every advantage to squeeze fee income from its customers. It would n't surprise me to learn that not disclosing the accrued interest is a company policy, based on some behavioral economic or algorithmic calculation, to take advantage of customers who think their account is closed so that Capital One can impose a late fee over some piddly interest amount - in my case it was {$2.00}. Capital One will never again be in my wallet. 

PS : When I called the Capital One customer service rep this month to learn why I was being charged this additional amount, I also asked what federal regulator I should contact to complain about the company 's service. After putting me on hold for several minutes, she came back on the line and said she could n't find out what federal regulator I should contact but did suggest I file a Better Business Bureau complaint. Capital One customer service reps do not know the company they work for is regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and can not tell a customer that - really? 
"
Capital One,"I updated my email through the Kohls website and they were not sending me my statements. It appears they have charged my account over XXXX dollars in late fees, and did not notify me they had not been receiving my payments on time. I had no way to determine they were not receiving them onetime since the statements did not come to me. and the payments are automatically withdrawn from my checking account each month. I asked if they would assist me and they said NO. I want some assistance in having these fees removed/reversed. 
"
Capital One,"My husband ( now ex ) put all his debt in my name including most of his student loans ( he is a doctor ), convincing me he would pay it in full. Unknown to me, he either missed payments or did not pay the full monthly amount adversely affecting my credit score. Little did I know, my husband was preparing to leave me with all his debt. This was devastating both emotionally and financially. I notified Capital One to inform them of my personal, financial hardship and asked if they could work with me. They refused, on several different occasions throughout three years. I informed them that my divorce lawyer was recommending I declare personal bankruptcy ; however, they still refused to help me repay the debt. I did not and will not declare bankruptcy ; however, Capital One has truly adversely affected my credit history ; despite my several attempts to explain my hardship. I am and have been paying them back once the credit card was ordered by the court to be my sole responsibility without my ex-husband 's need to control me. It has been three years since that court order and each payment was timely and in full. However, six payments missed still reside on my credit history. They have blatantly refused to help me in anyway, despite my several attempts. The debt was XXXX and now I am about to pay it in full with XXXX large check. Do not get a Capital One credit card, an unexpected hardship may occur and they will provide no assistance. Instead they contribute more pain, stress and grief to that hardship by their denial to assist in anyway ( even when you WANT to pay the debt back ). Capital One will watch you go through this hardship and then take their proverbial dagger and slice you at the heels. Crippling you more via your credit history!

Capital One,"There are late payments on my credit report that are not accurate. I was a victim of fraud which caused my personal checking accounts to bounce and therefore make my payments late.

I received another email shortly thereafter that the item was returned to sender as recipient refused. I never received the item, I contacted Kohls to find out where items were being shipped to, they confirmed a different address. I provided them with my current address on every single call I placed to them, upon order submission, upon tracking request and reshipment. Seems they do not update their files. I was assured my account would not be affected and that items missing would be reshipped, or I could cancel item. I opted to cancel the item since they tried to ship it twice and I was not receiving item since they kept sending it to the incorrect address. 

I have called repeatedly in the last few days and keep getting same run around with me having to provide them with my address, when I provide them with the current valid address I keep getting told that is the incorrect address and that they can not help me unless I provide them with the "" old '' address.

Capital One,"I contacted Capitol One so that i could do a balance transfer for {$6000.00} from another card. I had a credit limit of {$4000.00} and was calling to ask for a {$2000.00} credit limit increase. I was told by the representative that i needed to complete a request online. I completed the online request and a few days later received a denial notice stating that there was no recent payment history ( account is 14 years old ). I called Capitol One to speak to a representative about the denial since I have the account for XXXX years and my credit score is XXXX and my income is {$100000.00} annually. The representative told me i could try again, so i asked for a Supervisor whom also told me to try again. I advised the supervisor that my other credit card accounts have much less time and i have much higher limits, so if its not a credit nor salary problem then why could n't Capitol One accommodate my request since i have XXXX years history? The supervisor told me to try again and left no explanation. I advised the Supervisor i wanted to cancel my card if Capitol one could n't accommodate my request without a decent explanation. The supervisor in a condescending matter advised me as if it were a threat that the account would be reported reflect closed by consumer. At which point i ended the phone call. This is the worst customer service i have ever seen by a credit card company. Its quite clear Capitol One prefers online customer service transaction verses speaking with a live representative. Its also clear that good credit, income and 14 year history mean nothing to Capitol One.

Capital One,"I have a Capitol One XXXX XXXX that I pay every month with on line bill pay. I do not get statements from them either paper or email. If I want to see my statement I have to go on line and look for them. This is a big part of the problem. I pay them {$75.00} a month every month to clear my balance which was about {$2000.00}. I have this set up in my bank 's bill pay to automatically arrive on time every month. 
In XXXX of XXXX I made a payment of {$35.00} instead of my usual {$75.00}. Unfortunately the minimum due was {$39.00} which I did not have a statement to see. Since I paid {$4.00} under the minimum due I got a {$35.00} late fee added to my account. The next month I went back to paying my {$75.00} a month not knowing I was getting a late fee and added interest EVERY MONTH for the last 18 months because they never sent me a letter or called me about my account. I just happened to go online in XXXX of XXXX expecting to see my balance almost being cleared. You can imagine how upset I was, how angry I was when I saw that my monthly payments were getting taken up by late fees and added interest every month and all the months of on time payments being made for more than the minimum due had gotten me nowhere because of a {$4.00} typo when I paid my bill in XXXX of XXXX. I have never even missed a payment on this card! I called Capitol One and the representative gave me credit for {$210.00} XXXX 6 months of late fees ) and {$94.00} in interest payments.

There were also no documents in the online banking showing that an annual fee was going to be charged. I called Capital One and they could not confirm that I had received any communication regarding the change of terms and the new annual fee that I was being charged that also led to a late fee because I had no idea I was being charged the annual fee.

They refuse to help me get my credit card account back in order and expect me to pay for charges that are n't mine. I 've had rude representatives accuse me of having a husband and allowing him to use the card, having a drug addict for a family member steal it, been accused of losing the XXXX credit card when I was HOLDING THE CARD IN MY HAND, and ca n't even verify who I am with the company. They are making outrageous demands and refused to acknowledge that someone has hacked my account. The representatives demanded I send them my driver 's license, bank account information and statements, social security card without giving me any alternatives at all. I do NOT live in a XXXX area and need a driver 's license to legally drive. They refuse to help me at all and hang up after keeping me on hold for 20 - 30 minutes and my next stop will be to XXXX places since I ca n't continue to take this kind of abuse. 1. I will take the recorded conversations from the racist and sexist reps and upload them to an account and link it to show people the extreme bias and victim blame this company practices with impunity. I have NEVER had a late payment and for someone to get into my account, change ALL of my contact information, have Capital One send them MY INFORMATION and a replacement card is outrageous. I have been a model customer and now they 're claiming I owe them money when I 've paid off my card. I even have a rewards balance of {$77.00} and they will NOT even acknowledge the fact they failed to pick up on any fraud. I have had at least XXXX charges after they lied about locking/restricting the account and will not pay them since I have NOT used the credit card in question. ALL charges that I had made have been paid off. 2. I will have no choice but to contract a law firm, most likely the XXXX to advocate on my behalf for the minimum of a breach in contract against Capital One and for damages to my credit score, mental, emotional and psychological health. This means any absurd claim they have ( as I have already consulted a lawyer ) stating I "" ca n't sue via class action or other '' means it is null and void since Capital One has breached their own contract agreement. Since I have wasted an absurd amount of time documenting this fraud, filing a complaint with the local sheriff 's department, followed up with law enforcement, gone through all of my information, filed with the appropriate departments and government entities, there is no reason at all for Capital One to treat me like a criminal. No one has bothered to call me at all with the number I left every single representative. As a victim I have performed every single due diligence and there is no excuse for this. I do have rights and if I have to exercise them I will do so as a victim of fraud and a U.S. citizen in the court of law in order to protect myself from Capital One. I have not received any response and will take any lack of further action as acknowledgement of aiding fraud by criminals through Capital One.

After disputing with all XXXX credit bureaus, I get a unanamous answer saying Capital One is reporting the late payments so my credit reports can not be changed.

So due to the lack of efficiency of Capital One, the consumer, has to pay unauthorized charges. Not only that, despite me having flagged unauthorized charges from vendors, they continued to authorize charges from these same vendors despite the card number having being changed. The explanation for this is that XXXX has updated the vendor with the new card number. So, to sum up, despite me flagging a vendor as having made unauthorized charges on my account, Capital One has seen fit to go ahead and without my permission update the vendor with my new card number and then had the gall to actually authorize further charges on the card. 

This is a travesty of consumer rights. I did not give Capital One any permission to update vendors when my card number changes. In fact, I want quite the opposite. Why is this being done? Is this legal?

Capital One,"I opened up my card in XXXX, XXXX ; had no issues. However, in XXXX, XXXX I had made a payment of XXXX which was charged twice to my account. I had gone to the bank thinking it was an error on their end, showed them my payment confirmation, however, was advised that the payment was pulled twice from Capital One. At the time, it was not a big deal because I did n't lose the money, as it just made a payment of XXXX to my account. Then the next month, I made a payment of XXXX, which again was charged twice. I went back in to the bank and they advised that XXXX payments were pulled. Again, the money went back on to the account and I could just use my credit card instead so I did not dispute it and just left it alone. 
The huge problem came on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when a payment of XXXX and a payment of XXXX were cleared through my bank, however, were not showing as paid out through Capital One. I contacted Capital One "" Customer Service '' at XXXX and spoke with a sweet rep who had advised that the XXXX payment had been cleared, however, the XXXX payment had a hold on it and had to be cleared by the bank. I had advised the rep that I was outside of the store now and asked if I should wait there or if this would take a long time and I should leave, she stated that she just needed to contact my bank, get the clearance then she would release the payment and would be able to use it in about XXXX minutes. She places me on a XXXX way call to my bank, and we spoke with XXXX at my bank who was able to verify my information and then verify the payment of XXXX. We hung up with XXXX and the Cap One rep placed me on hold to release the XXXX payment. The rep got back on the phone and had advised that she was having issues and needed to place me on hold and transfer me to a specialist that would help me. 
I was placed on hold over XXXX minutes and transferred to a new rep who had no idea what was going on. I again went through the entire story and the rep stated that she can not release the payment as the XXXX payment needed to be verified. I asked for a supervisor and the rep transferred me to a supervisor named XXXX. XXXX repeated everything that was already said to me and I had advised him that the first rep I spoke to already took care of this, and had spoke with XXXX to verify the payment. XXXX stated that there were no notes of this ever happening, I asked him to get the first rep I spoke with as she would have the notes or at least be able to tell him that this was verified. XXXX proceeded to repeat the informaiton that he had stated, and I asked if he had heard anything I had said, and he said he already told me there were no notes on there and that he cant release the payment until then. I told him that I have been on the phone over an hour and its now passed XXXX and my bank is closed and asked what I am supposed to do because my bank account was almost emptied due to the payment, and as the payment is not cleared through Cap One, I have no money on my credit card, so cant get groceries and nothing is open on Monday because its a holiday. He stated "" I do n't know what to tell you, cause it was n't verified '' I said "" Yes it was verified, back when the bank was open and when I first called at XXXX. '' I had advised him as well that I can send him the info to show that the payment already cleared my bank since he can not reach out to verify that the bank was called. Which he said no to and said, he does n't know what to tell me. I stated "" I have XXXX kids at home and no groceries now, what am I supposed to do for 3 days? He said "" Welp, do n't know what to tell you, I cant see that this was done. I ended up closing my card, and asked for a refund, as I overpaid on my credit card and he then proceeded to say my refund will be sent in XXXX pay cycles! TWO MONTHS!! He was so rude and was a sorry excuse for a supervisor.

Capital One,"In XXXX, 2015, I applied for a credit card at Lord & Taylor in New York. I was denied credit. This was highly embarrassing to me, since I have always had an outstanding credit rating. The formal rejection letter from Capital One said I could obtain my XXXX credit report, which I then ordered. That credit report did not show any debt ( our mortgage is paid off and I am retired ) and indicated that all credit cards are being paid monthly per terms. I wrote Capital One twice and copied their President, XXXX XXXX XXXX, after no response to my first letter. His office contacted me via phone but they were unable to provide any evidence of debt I have or even explain why my credit application was denied. Thus I am asking for CFPB to assist me. I obviously do not want a credit card from Capital One ( I used an XXXX XXXX card for the Lord & Taylor purchase ), but I do not want a credit denial lodged on my credit record, particularly since I am retired. ( I do have assets but not income from a job. ) I may want to get other credit cards in the future and this inappropriate denial of credit may prevent that. I asked Capital One to lift the credit denial against me since there was no justification but they have not done so nor have they provided any rationale for the credit denial. I have been highly dissatisfied with this experience and Capital One ( which continues to send me unsolicited offers for credit cards despite my having a "" do not solicit '' request formally filed ). Thank you very much for your help.

Capital One,"I recently set up a checking account with CapOne360. I deposted {$4000.00} into the the account. I received a message saying it would take a week before the funds would be available. Once the funds were finally availlable, I set up a wire transfer so that I could transfer funds into my personal checking account. I received a new message saying that I would take three business days to establish the new wire transfer account. Once the account was finally established after the three business days I attempted to make a transfer into the newly established account with the available funds and I received a new message saying that Cap One would hold the funds for an additional three days before the funds would be transferred to the new account.

Capital One,"I 'm complaining about Capital One Bank USA. I believe they 're inaccurately reporting a credit card account under my name. Specifically, they consider me a joint account holder when I was/am only an authorized user. This account was originally an HSBC-XXXX credit card account opened by my mother in 2003. The account was eventually transferred over to Capital One. I believe when this transfer occurred, Capital One began to erroneously categorize me as a joint account holder. They have no basis to support this characterization. Namely, they do not have the original application. If they do not have the original application, they can not accurately confirm how the card was applied for. The account was opened when I was only XXXX XXXX XXXX. I never signed the application. I 've complained to Capital One via telephone and through a letter but they have refused to help me.

I never recieved a notice or warning that these cards would be closed. I got upset and did close XXXX of the accounts and asked them to please open my cards again. Upon doing this I had a credit line of XXXX on XXXX of the cards but was given only XXXX limit. I think this company needs to let people know when they are going to just close your accounts especially when you are XXXX XXXX and potentially not able to use them for a period of time when you are XXXX for a year. My home address is correct my wife had power of attorney they could have contacted us via mail or phone before they did that. Now I have a lower credit limit than I was granted before the closure and a hard hit on my reports because I had to redo the same account they closed. I would appriciate the full credit line I initially was granted and Capital One knows I am military because they have been sent proof for lower interest rates while deployed and failed to give them however when contacted did fix the matter. I would like to know why I was not contacted about the closures becasue I would have had them stay open as we kept them with zero balance and had all XXXX ready in case of an emergancy while I was delpoyed or in the event of unforeseen expenses.

I called again and was transferred to the fraud department and I told them my complaint and that I had never received the fraud packet. They informed me that their findings determined that it was not a fraudulent account and that 's why they never sent me anything. I also received a letter from the IRS stating that I owed money since the account was written off. I have been unable to obtain any information from Capital Once regarding these charges they allege I owe. I asked when and where the account was open, if they had my signature on file, I asked for a detailed explanation of all the charges. The only question they answered was that the account was closed in 2009. I have contacted the IRS and they are investing my claim as well. I maintain that this account is not mine and was opened without my consent. I have called capital one 3 times and I still have no answers. I want to know how and when this account was opened? A detailed list of all charges? They stated this account was closed in 2009, who closed this account? Why was it closed? Why is this the first time I am hearing of a debt to them? This account was closed in 2009 ... .7 years later and the only reason I found out about this account was because it came up on my credit report and I received a bill from the IRS.

Capital One,"I have a Capital One credit card I opened last year early summer perhaps. I knew I had a 0 % introductory APR on purchases that expired in 2016, I could n't remember if it was XXXX or XXXX. Yesterday I went looking for this info and was surprised that there was no reference to it anywhere on my statements or online profile for this credit card. After contacting Capital One I learned that this information is not available to me, I have to call in and ask about it. It appears that by not being upfront about this information they are making it very easy for the consumer to miss the date the balance would need to be paid off so they could assess all the interest charges. This does not appear to be a fair or upfront practice.

Dispute team works only M-F during certain hours ... long verification process and around 20 minutes per call.

Capital One,"I have been making my Kohl 's credit card payments monthly for two years without miss through my bill pay at my bank. 
I see my min payment amt went up drastically this month so I called Kohls customer service to find out why. They are stating my payments have been late for over 7 months! 
They have not. Looking at my payments, I have actually paid the account in advance, plus more than the minimum due. There is a problem between the payments being sent every four weeks ( every XXXX Friday ) and the way Kohls is applying the payment. For example : The due date is the XXXX. If my bank sent payment on the XXXX one month, it is properly applied to the XXXX of the following month. 
But if my bank sends 4 weeks later on the XXXX, it does not get applied to the following month. The next month 's payment goes out 4 wks later on the XXXX, and then they say it is late and charge a {$35.00} late fee- even though this payment is early. This has been happening for over 6 months and I never realized it as I knew I was making my monthly payments for greater than the minimum. So they not only have been charging me late fees for making my payments early, but have also been reporting to the credit bureaus that I have been late when I have NOT. I am very frustrated. I am sure I am not the only consumer this is happening to. We should not be penalized for making payments early. There should be a system in place to prevent this mis-applying of payments and charging unfair late fees to consumers- especially ones like me who have been faithful in paying every single month.

Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX we checked out of XXXX XXXX resort in XXXX, XXXX. We had a bill totaling XXXX. We paid a deposit prior to arrive of XXXX bringing out total owed to XXXX. Upon arrive we sat and spoke with a concierge and gave her a card to hold for incidentals ( Capitol One master card ) with the understanding our outstanding balance would be XXXX, and any additional rentals or food charges should they incur. At the end of our stay we checked out and paid and authorized {$700.00} on the master card and an additional {$1300.00} on a via card. Lastly we had rentals for snorkling gear we added in for payment ( total {$29.00} ) on the same master card. Upon departing around XXXX we were unable to receive a receipt from the hotel to sign and confirm all purchases because they could not complete the charges as explained without a manager to explain them. We asked for a receipt to be sent to us electronically and we would be on the XXXX of XXXX for an additional 5 hours should there be any further questions with charges. Upon departure the XXXX XXXX resort charged the master card an additional {$700.00}. There was no authorization for this charge to be run on the master card - as the limit for the card is {$750.00}. If there was a remaining {$700.00} balance, which we were not informed of in writing upon arrival with all other noted charges, the charge would have been paid with a debit or credit card having sufficient funds. The charge was disputer with Capitol One immediately and followup from XXXX XXXX stated they did charge the master card for {$700.00} - twice. This was unauthorized by the sole card holder. I would not and did not authorize a charge that is double my credit card maximum allowance. I have great concerns over the fraudulence on charges for {$700.00} on XXXX XXXX with NO AUTHORIZATION.

Capital One,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to close my Capital One credit card due to issues with customer service. Capital One refused to do so, however. As of this writing, it appears that Capital One has still refused to do so. The first attempt was via telephone, starting at XXXX XXXX. The initial representative refused to close the account ( on which there was a zero balance ), as did the supervisor. Further, the supervisor refused to provide a NY address to which complaints and a written instruction to close the account could be sent. 

The second call, starting at XXXX XXXX was largely similar. I then tried to close the account via the website. Despite allowing virtually every other type of transaction, the website does not apparently permit the closing of an account requiring that to be accomplished via telephone. I can only assume this is part of an intentional strategy to frustrate customers who wish to leave Capital One. The third call was substantially similar to the first two, except that Capital One cut off the call when I asked to speak to a supervisor. 

The representative on the fourth call, after a few minutes, said that she would close the account, then told me it was accomplished, and promised an email confirming the closure. Thereafter, however, she transferred me to another person, who said the account was still open. This after more than an hour trying to close the account.

They told me that a letter was sent on XX/XX/XXXX stating I would need evidence supporting the vacuum does not work and also a letter from another company who sells vacuums, stating 1. what the merchant who who sold me the vacuum did incorrectly, 2. how the problem can be corrected and 3. the cost to correct it. 
My problem is that I can not find another company who sells vacuums that will give me this type of letter they are requesting, especially if I did not purchase from them. I also do n't know how to give evidence that the vacuum does not work, another requirement from Capital One Bank. 
I feel these requests that Capital One Bank are impossible to obtain and completely unfair.

Capital One,"I inadvertently applied a payment to my daughter 's Kohl 's account instead of my own. The minute I found out about it ( when I got my daughter 's bill showing a credit ), I contacted them. I asked if they could transfer the money and they said they would take care of it. Had they told me what a headache it was going to be I would have just double paid, but I believed them when they said it would be done. When I got my next bill reflecting the money had not transferred, I contacted them again. Again they promised it would be resolved and I would not be reported as being late on my credit report. Multiple times I was contacted by them and I contacted them as well, to resolve this matter and repeatedly was told it would be resolved and my credit history would be restored. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and determined everything had been resolved and asked that they let me know when I could expect them to get my credit rating fixed ( my son, who is on the account with me, gets his credit score free every month from a different credit card he holds and the score had dropped XXXX points ). They said they would look into it and get back to me. I called again the following day only to be told that it was my fault and the credit would stand. I was then told to send a letter, which I immediately did ( attached ). I got their response on Saturday telling me that they would n't fix it ( also attached ).

Capital One,"Capital One sent me an approved credit card with a XXXX XXXX dollar limit. This sounded like a good idea since my XXXX credit score was obliterated due to a house staying on the market for twenty months from XX/XX/XXXX to almost XX/XX/XXXX while trying to pay the new mortgage on the house we had moved to. After having the new Capital One card for a short period of time, they began sending me e- mails telling me that if I would update my personal info they would increase my line of credit. I did n't want an increase so I NEVER updated my profile. They increased my credit anyway. Because our finances have changed for the worst over the last several years there were many times I used the card still thinking I could get the balance under control. We are a family of XXXX living on XXXX annually, not so easy to do. Capital One offered me another card with no interest for nine months. I decided at least I could switch the balance since the previous card 's interest rate was now around 23 % and my balance was getting high. After I received the card I was told I could not transfer my previous balance to the new card so I was stuck. The first card has such high interest and I was trying very hard to pay it down but to no avail. Then with the new card they kept increasing my credit, again without me requesting this. Now the promotional interest rate is gone and the new rate is around 25 % just like the other and no matter how much I sacrifice here at home I ca n't get my head above water with reducing my balances with these XXXX Capital One cards. I understand I am responsible for what I charged. It just seems to me they are even more responsible and their predatory practices should be investigated. They are taking great advantage of the consumer. I know I 'm not the only one. My only goal was to help repair my credit. Now I am XXXX in credit card debt to these people and I do n't even know how it happened. It happened so fast. I have always been very responsible with my bills, but these last seven years have been like a financial nightmare. I wish I just had my bad credit and had never heard of Capital One. It is definitely affecting my health. I feel like a fool. Thank you so much for the chance to tell my story and I hope it will help other consumers in the future.

Capital One,"Dear Sir/Ma'am I am writing in regards to my Menards ' Big Card. I paid my minimum balance on XXXX/XXXX/16 of {$110.00} and an additional {$1000.00}. I wrote on my check that I wanted the extra to go against the 6 month higher interest rate charge. 
At that time I had the following charges - XXXX - 48 month 3.99 financing - {$2900.00} - XXXX 6 month same as cash accruing 25.24 % - {$1400.00} So I figured that the extra {$1000.00} would go against the XXXX When I look at my XX/XX/XXXX statement. I see that all but {$44.00} went against the 48 month 3.99 % financing. The {$44.00} was the minimum payment due. 
Again I made a payment at the store for {$1500.00} and {$350.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16. Again I asked for the extra to be applied to the 6 month free financing. 
When I look at my XX/XX/XXXX statement, it shows that all of this was applied to the minimum balances due and to the reduced 48 month financing. 
I would like this fixed so that I am not charged an exorbitant amount of interest in 3 and 4 months ' time when the promotional expiration date is completed. 
I would like the minimum payment due applied as specified in the statement and then I would like the extra {$1000.00} from XXXX XXXX, 2016 - removed from the txn XXXX ( 48 months free ) - and applied against txn XXXX ( 6 months same as cash accruing 25.24 % ) So their balance as of the XX/XX/XXXX statement would be - $ XXXX = {$2800.00} + 6.39 Interest = & gt ; {$2800.00} - $ XXXX {$420.00} With a new transaction - XXXX - 6 month same as cash accruing 25.24 % {$710.00} ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ) On my XX/XX/XXXX I get a PROMOTION Expiration ALERT!! Saying that the transaction that I thought would be paid off. Has n't been paid off at all and there is {$68.00} of deferred interest. I was paying off the promotional payoff. 
I had made two more payments on XX/XX/XXXX of {$1800.00} to pay the minimum balance and pay against the transactions - XXXX = $ XXXX-XXXX ( minimum ) = {$380.00} - XXXX = $ XXXX-XXXX ( minimum ) = {$690.00} - XXXX = $ XXXX-XXXX = {$2800.00} Leaving {$1700.00} left to pay off the 6 months same as cash and start on the 48 months low rate Should have balances of - XXXX = {$380.00} - XXXX = XXXX - XXXX = {$690.00} - XXXX =XXXX - XXXX = {$2800.00} - XXXX = {$2100.00} + the accrued interest With my new transactions - XXXX ( 48 month 3.99 % financing ) {$1500.00} - XXXX {$310.00} Return - XXXX of {$200.00} against txn XXXX So I should have the following transactions left to pay off - XXXX ( 48 months 3.99 % from XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) - XXXX ( 48 months 3.99 % from XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) - XXXX ( from XXXX/XXXX/2016 at 25.24 % ) I am not exactly sure how much these each should be because of the return and the different interest that was n't added on because of how the different transactions were cleared off. 
I would like the following {$200.00} to be paid against the minimum due against transactions - XXXX ( 48 months 3.99 % from XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) - XXXX ( 48 months 3.99 % from XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) - XXXX ( from XXXX/XXXX/2016 at 25.24 % ) And the remainder paid against - XXXX ( from XXXX/XXXX/2016 at 25.24 % ). 
By law the highest percent interest transaction should be paid off first with any moneys left over after the minimum amount due is applied. 25.24 % accruing interest is much higher than 3.99 %.

When I signed up for the promotion, I was under the impression that I would not have to pay any interest on future purchases for 18 months. After an online chat and a phone call with Capital One, I was informed that the offer only applied to balance transfers and did not apply to future purchases. Not only would I not have signed up for the promotion whatsoever had I known that it was only for balance transfers, but I also would not have spent XXXX in one month! I saved the promotional email which is deceiving. It explicitly states "" Want to avoid paying interest on new purchases? If you accept this offer, you can avoid interest on new purchases. Pay the Interest Saver Payment ( your minimum payment plus all non-promotional balances, including purchases, cash advances, fees, and finance charges ) by the due date each month, and you wo n't pay interest on new purchase transactions '' I do n't need a promotion to pay my credit card balance in full every month. I can do that without jumping through hoops to sign up for their promotion. This is the most deceiving fraudulent experience I have had in a long time! This deceptive tactic tricks users into signing up for a promotion where they believe their problems are over and they will have 18 months of no interest, so that after the users ( who probably would n't have spent the money anyway ) rack up a massive credit card bill, they tell you you must pay the entire balance to avoid interest!

Capital One,"I signed up for a Capital One card in XX/XX/XXXX. The interest on the card was unmanageable, and after making $ XXXX/month payments that did nothing to reduce what I owed, I stopped making payments in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. 

I realized this would negatively impact my credit, but I had no means to pay down the high interest on the card. In XX/XX/XXXX, while in college at XXXX, Capital One sued to collect all the unpayable interest. When I received the notice of legal action, I also received a credit card offer in the mail the same day from Capital One. I had no money for legal representation and Capital One won in my absence. 

That was in XX/XX/XXXX, and in the years since, I have received many credit card offers from Capital One, but I heard nothing in regards to the judgement against me. 

11 years later XX/XX/XXXX, I was sent a notice of wage garnishment. They are now attempting to collect over {$3000.00} from me. In the 3 weeks since receiving that notification, I have also received XXXX different Capital One credit card offers. 

I make $ XXXX/hr. I have no savings. I have student loans I ca n't afford to pay, and a car I ca n't afford to fix. I live in a XXXX room apartment. Despite all of this, Capital One is taking {$170.00} out of each check ; that 's {$350.00} a month. I can no longer afford to pay basic bills. 

Capital One gave out credit cards specifically to profit from the high interest, then waited to pursue legal action until the last possible moment, then waited 11 years to collect on that debt. If Capital One was so concerned with getting their money then why would they wait 5+ years to sue, then 11 more years to collect? If they 're so concerned with collecting their debt that they sue a poor college kid, then why have they consistently tried to sign me up for another Capital One card since suing me? 

I 'm asking that in light of Capital One 's predatory practices and continued disregard for the ability of the poor people they prey upon to pay back debt while still sending new credit card offers, that this debt be forgiven by the company and that all future credit card offers cease. 

Their actions have shown that, by continuing to offer more credit cards, they do n't need the money and they do not care about giving it away.

The letter dated the same the same day, XXXX is also nameless and does not give a specific reason for closing the account.

Capital One,"A fraudulent credit card account was opened in my name at Kohl 's in XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Kohl 's acknowledged the fraudulent nature of the account and relieved me of responsibility. Now, Kohl 's refuses to act on my request to send me copies of the fraudulent documentation used in opening that account ; instead, Kohl 's states that such information will be provided only to a law enforcement agency, at the request of said agency. As I read Title 15 U.S. Code Chapter 41 Subchapter III Section 1681g, the victim himself is entitled to copies of the fraudulent documentation but must make the request for it in writing and must meet other reasonable requirements that can be imposed by the business which granted the credit. It is my understanding that providing the information to a law enforcement agency is contemplated in XXXX scenarios : ( 1 ) where the victim 's written request specifies which agency is to receive the documentation ; or, ( 2 ) where there happens to be a law enforcement agency investigating the ID theft and that agency is authorized by the victim to take the relevant records. I do not see how these provisions can be interpreted by the credit-granting business to deny the victim 's request to be given the fraudulent documentation directly. In my case, I have sent Kohl 's written requests to have the information sent to me. Accordingly, scenario ( 1 ) above does not apply. Also, as there is no law enforcement agency investigating my ID theft, notwithstanding reports filed at XXXX separate police departments, scenario ( 2 ) above does not apply. In summary, I believe that Kohl 's misunderstands the right of the victim of ID theft to receive directly, and not via a law enforcement agency, copies of the fraudulent documentation and is unreasonably attempting to require me to trouble one or another law enforcement agency to obtain copies of the fraudulent documentation on my behalf.

When I told them I did not have an electric bill, they then asked for my bank statement. When I refused, they then threated to not only to close the account I had just applied for, but also the account I had for over a year. After speaking to their representive for about 30 minutes asking for a supervisor without her giving me XXXX, I did tell her to close the accounts in frustration. 
I believe that was too much information, as well as being disrespected by their representive by not allowing me to speak to anyone besides her. 
Later that night I called back and was told by a supervisor that was the only way to keep both accounts open. Even the original XXXX. He also told me a more secure way to send they information rather than faxed as I was told at first. So, I sent it. However, the account was closed anyway.

At that time in XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Capital One Bank did not send in my payment on time as agreed to XXXX XXXX even though they had my correct Checking Account information. Capital One intentionally and with great harm to myself and my Credit Score refused to remove the 30 day late and instead tried to find fault with me. The fact is that Capital One is mad because XXXX XXXX was ending their relationship with them so they did not send my payment in on time. When I asked them to correct this issue they instead refused even after I Disputed this false reporting to all three Credit Reporting Agencies.

I immediately paid XXXX XXXX myself since Capital One failed to pay them as agreed out of my same checking account. I then made arrangements with the new Credit Card XXXX XXXX XXXX insure that future payments were made on time as agreed to XXXX XXXX. I then contacted all three Credit Bureaus and properly filled a Dispute.regarding Capital One intentional missed payment. All three Credit Reporting Agencies informed me that they will not and can not change my Credit Report and that they must report what Capital One Bank is reporting to them. They ignored my statement regarding this issue and ignored letters I received from XXXX XXXX stating I made the payment directly to them and that they had ended their relationship with Capital One Bank and were in fact in transition during the time this issue occurred. Capital One Bank continues to harm me as I am not able to improve my Credit score. I have been denied Credit as well. The false report to the Credit Brueas Is intentional as I no longer have any type of relationship with Capital One Credit. After many calls and letter Capital One Credit refuses to correct his false reporting even though they caused this problem intentionally and with Great Harm to me and my Credit. Please investigate this very important problem and make Capital One correct this to reflect that I paid on time as agreed and stop them from continuing to harm me.and my Credit Report. Please make the Credit Reporting Agencies correct my report so that I will stop being denied credit and show that the payment were made to XXXX XXXX even thought Capital One refuses to correct their own false Repo This is what is being reported on my Credit Report : CAP1/XXXX Payment Status : Unknown Balance : {$0.00} Account # : XXXX Date Open : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Last Updated : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Account Status : Closed Terms : Revolving Phone # : - Address : - Ownership : Individual Original Creditor : - Company Sold-to : XXXX Credit Limit : {$1500.00} Monthly Payment : - Past Due Amount : - High Balance : {$1000.00} Balloon Payment : - Comments : N/A As you can see the Credit report does not show any late payments however in further investigation I discovered that Capital One is Reporting that I was late on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. My Credit report also shows that on that same time period XXXX/XXXX/XXXX my XXXX XXXX Credit Card with XXXX XXXX is correctly reporting that I made my payment on time as agreed, It is important to consider that at that time XXXX XXXX ended their relationship with Capital One and as reported on my Credit Report XXXX XXXX obtained my Credit Card Agreement from Capital One. Capital One is and continues to make false reports on my account with XXXX XXXX during the time they were responsible to pay my payment was make on time, they failed to do so Instead state that I am at fault.

In addition, on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I charged the amount of {$1400.00} for XXXX for a total of {$4200.00}. However, I have paid it off a couple of days later.

However, she did not do what she promised that she will repay me and pay off the credit card debt. Therefore, she added herself as an authorized user, overcharged for her daily living and luxury vacation, cash advances, used my credited amount fraudulently. Capital One refused to take this as a fraud case. They claim that I am responsible for the debt that XXXX has charged. I have been calling Capital One since XX/XX/XXXX. However, the conversations with the representatives are different each time. There are different issues and suggestions stated by the representative. I was told that all I need is to have XXXX signed an admittance letter stating that did used my credit card without my knowledge and will take responsibility for this debt. XXXX stated that she did signed the admittance letter and sent to them. However, Capital One stated that they never suggest the admittance letter and never received it.

I called Kohl 's, told them I had not received any bills, but paid the amount of purchases, plus late fees. Kohl 's did not attempt to call me, even though they had my home, my cell, and my business phone numbers. When I applied for a business loan - my bank said I had a negative credit report from Kohl 's. That is how I found out Kohl 's reported my missed payments, although no one said anything to me when I called and paid the late bill. Kohl 's did not send me a letter saying they would be reporting me, although I believe they are required to notify me they will report negative information. Kohl 's made no attempt to send me copies of the bills that they supposedly sent me for two months prior to the final notice. I did ask Kohl 's to retract the negative information, but they refuse. Please see my original correspondence, their reply, plus my rebuttal. Since I do not expect a reply to the last letter, I am submitting my complaint as promised.

Capital One,"I recently accepted an offer for the GM "" XXXX '' rewards card. I created an online account and enabled online billing statements as I do with all of my cards. Shortly after doing this, CapitalOne started listing the online portal as "" Website Maintenance in Progress ''. I have tried to access the portal on numerous occasions over the past month but the portal has been "" Website Maintenance in Progress '' every time I have attempted to access it. Given the maintenance, I can not log in to my online account to make payments, or more importantly, receive my billing statement. I was forced to make a phone payment on this account without being able to review my statement for accuracy.

This morning, XXXX, I received an email saying that my loan had been approved and posted to my account. I logged into my account, and saw that indeed my balance had increased by the amount requested. 

But, I have not yet received or deposited the check. It seemed to me that the loan should not be in effect until I deposit the check. Until then, nothing has really happened. 

I contacted CapOne through online chat to try to get them to reverse the charge ( and the clock starting on the intro rate ) until I deposited the check. Their policy turns out to be even worse than I thought. They told me that it can take up to two weeks for the check to be sent out, but that, indeed the balance posts and the clock starts from the day the loan is approved. 

Think about it this way. When I bought my apartment, I applied for a loan. My loan was approved. But my loan was not in effect until the closing, when funds were actually dispersed to the buyer. 

In this case, they are calling it a loan and have started the clock when the check has n't even left their building, let alone disbursed any funds! 

This ca n't possibly be right. Please make them address this abusive policy for all balance transfer customers.

Capital One,"The following is an explanation of the background and issue I have had with Capital One. 
I had purchased a XXXX vacation program in XXXX XXXX. The XXXX vacation membership program I purchased included a "" XXXX '' benefit where the owner would be reimbursed for the time share maintenance fees in exchange for XXXX to have rights to the timeshare for the corresponding week. I submitted my time share for cash exchange and was advised that it would not be accepted since the all-inclusive was mandatory for the time share. This exception was not disclosed to me at the time of the purchase of the vacation membership program. I was also not advised that there was a service fee for the cash exchange and that the week had to be reserved for a specific week of the year. The XXXX XXXX was the primary reason I purchased the membership program. XXXX has not paid the maintenance fee for my time share as they agreed to in the contract. I contacted XXXX after receiving the XXXX email and was advised that they would not honor the cash exchange for my time share. I requested a refund and was advised that they would not refund the charge for the membership. 
The merchant has not addressed the issue during any part of this review. The information they responded with did not in any way address the issue. 
I have contacted the Merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the merchant, several times and left my contact information. I have not received a return call. My most recent message was on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I sent an email to the merchant and they did not respond to the issue. 
A second opinion from an attorney was provided to Capital One indicating that the Merchants actions were considered fraudulent in nature. 
A second opinion from another merchant in the same field was provided to Capital One indicating that the Merchant 's actions were considered fraudulent in nature. 
When I learned that the merchant did not disclose the pertinent information about the vacation program to me and because of that I could not use it, I requested Capital One to dispute the charge. I have provided an explanation of the issue and second opinions from an attorney and another merchant to Capital One. All of the documentation requested by Capital One was provided. Capital One has not addressed the issue with the Merchant. The Merchant has not responded to the issue. There is no mention of the cash exchange in the Merchants correspondence. The second opinions clearly state the actions by the vendor were fraudulent. Capital one has not clearly stated why the dispute was considered resolved in their opinion. Capital One has not appropriately addressed this issue.

It was a credit card I have n't used in around 8 years. They ( They being capital one 's fraud department ) said that I would not be liable for the charge since it was fraud. They asked me if I wanted a new card issued or if I wanted my account closed. I asked that my account be closed. I was transferred to someone else that helped me close my account. Once the account was closed, I again verified that I would not be responsible for the charge to XXXX.

Not only did I not receive something showing my account was closed, but today I received a bill for the charge we specifically discussed on the XXXX. Today is XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/2015. The XXXX fraud team member at Capital One that I spoke to today XXXX XXXX, was by the name of XXXX ( or at least that 's what it sounded like ). She informed me that they have no way of flagging it as fraud until it has posted to the account. Then she informed me that there was a XXXX charge to a restaurant that was already removed from my account. I was insisting that she explain to me how XXXX charge was never mentioned to me and why would they even call me to ask about the fraud if there was nothing they can do about it and were going to send me a bill anyway. She hung up on me. So, I called back and asked to speak to a manager. I was connected with a supervisor named XXXX. He apologized that she hung up on me and proceeded to confirm that the way their process works, they can not remove charges until they post. I am still confused as to why they would call me before it posts or not mention that I need to call back after it posts in order to actually fix anything. The icing on the cake, was when the supervisor XXXX told me he would connect me with someone else to close my account. I thought, WAIT! I already closed my account. Well, it turns out they do n't permanently close it until after there is a zero balance, and I could n't have a zero balance until that fraudulent charge was removed. I am beyond frustrated and upset by a situation where I already felt violated that someone stole my information and attempted to charge things under my name.

It appears they are using public information to obtain the numbers of family members without regard to privacy laws. I have made several telephone calls to Capitol One and am transferred to several departments. I am asked the same question, "" which numbers should be deleted from the account? '' I respond the same way. ALL OF THEM. I also have reminded them in each call, several times that leaving a message for a specific person, with specific private information on a generic voicemail is a privacy violation. This needs to cease. If they are doing this to one person, I am confident they are doing this to others.

There were no problems with the email system on my end. They were simply not sending statements.

Capital One,"I applied for a Capital One Quicksilver card on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I read through the terms presented on the webpage before filling out the application. The terms as presented on the webpage stated that there was no membership fee for the card. I received the card and activated it and was surprised to see a membership fee on the listed charges for the card when I set up an online account. I called to question the fee and was told that it was a term for my account. I went to double-check this and saw that the terms listed on my card did list a {$39.00} membership fee which was contrary to the terms presented to me when I signed up for the card. I faxed Capital One on XXXX XXXX, 2015 a letter letting them know that the terms presented to me when I signed up for the card did not state a membership fee and that was the card I thought I had signed up for. I included a print-out of the page I had read with the term listed of no membership fee. I received a response on XXXX XXXX, 2015 in the form of a letter from Capital One stating that they would not waive the membership fee. I called to follow up and was told that there are more than XXXX 'Capital One Quicksilver ' cards, a Quicksilver and a Quicksilver One and that I had applied for the one without the fee but qualified for the one with the fee. I am a very upset that I was misled in this manner by this type of bait-and-switch of XXXX cards with similar names. If Capital One wants to charge a membership fee they need to make it clear in the terms presented when you sign up for the card not just have it appear in the terms that appear once you have already gone through the process of applying for the card. This is a misrepresentation and/or fraudulent conduct as presented to the consumer. 
"
Capital One,"Capital One has charged me interest when I paid the balance printed on the current statement in full and by the due date. The supervisor is claiming this is due to the fact that charges posted afterward. When I questioned the most recent statement, I was advised that this was because my due date was on the XXXX, but my next bill generated on the XXXX, resulting in further charges being due. I asked how I could be charged interest on something that had n't yet been reflected on any billing and the same answer was repeated. The charges have not been credited back to my account. I even asked the supervisor if this is legal under the Credit Card Act, but again, received the same answer. I also read this to the supervisor. The XXXX line on the back of their bill reads as follows : How can I avoid paying interest charges? If you pay your statement 's New Balance in full by the due date ( which I did ), we will not charge you interest on the portion of the balance that you did not pay. It made no difference. 
"
Capital One,"XX/XX/XXXX, I was disputing late fees on my XXXX limit capital one account and was having a very difficult time. This went on for three months until the account was late 90 days XX/XX/XXXX. At this time Capital One added XXXX in fees as late fees/collection fees/attorney fees, and refused to work with me. XX/XX/XXXX, they charged off XXXX, so the account was at a XXXX balance. They can not charge off an account, take credit for this on their taxes and still show this balance that I owe. This would be fraud. The XXXX has continued to grow until today it is at XXXX. 
They do this to show my credit use at XXXX % of limit which destroys my credit score, so I will pay the XXXX. Again if I do pay this and they charged it off, that would be fraud on their part.

Capital One,"My card was stolen and there were unauthorized charges of XXXX and XXXX. I filed a police report.

And they were n't going to look at the tapes when the officers told me they would, and stated they do not get involved in civil disputes even though I have no clue who stole my card. He was talking over me. The previous rep stated that once I obtained a police report they would re open my case in which this manager refused to do so. I do n't feel I should be charged when my card was stolen and to be treated like a liar was very disrespectful

Which to date, I have not received as described per our contractual agreement, which I have enclosed for your review along with incriminating documentation that they are in fact a scam. Disgusted, does not begin to describe my outrage, after further investigation I discovered that this company is in cahoots with several other "" online businesses '' that prey on unsuspecting consumers. These career criminals, even go to the extreme of dragging you outside of your 60-120 day grace period to dispute the charge with the Credit Card Company or bank account with guarantees of success and profitable returns. I was advised by the attorney general 's office that there is an extended period of time allotted if the services were not rendered as described per Federal Regulation. Which has brought me here, needless to say I did not get the services I originally purchased. I have been taken advantage of, and need my credit card company to look into remedying this situation. I called my credit card company and spoke with XXXX ( I was on the phone for at least an hour ), she mentioned that because the card was closed they wo n't look into the matter.

I then called them for the last time, asking to be put on a remaining balance ( {$530.00} ) payment arrangement, they said no. So then, I logged into my XXXX online account, and saw that Capitol One had finally posted my remaining balance I owe, ( {$530.00} ) dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 in which I now will make XXXX $ /month payments on my own since they refused to me on the phone concerning a scheduled payment arrangement to pay the ( {$530.00} ) balance I owe. My point here and complaint is, I had to obtain and send a Notarized letter to them, or they would still be adding on interest money making the closed account balance larger which is illegal business practices, in closing, in reflect, I should and will in the future send a notarized letter dispute certified mail and the same letter regular mail ( XXXX ) and I will never ever have any more dealings with Capitol One. People are getting ripped off by these illegal business practices, word of caution, stay away from Capitol One credit card.

I opted for the Capital One XXXX for XXXX, that offers 2 % cashback on all purchases. Like the other XXXX accounts the corporation has, it requires a credit check for both myself and the corporation. The other XXXX accounts, XXXX with XXXX and XXXX XXXX, all report only to the Business entity, since it is a corporation and is treated as a separate person. In applying for those XXXX lines of credit, they show up as a 'hard ' credit inquiry on my personal credit, which was XXXX understood and assumed. However, the Capital One credit card shows up on XXXX on the business entity and my personal info. Highly unusual, but as I understand, legal ( especially when considering my excellent credit ). I informed them of this perceived inaccuracy and they assured me this is their standard practice, to dual report on all businesses, regardless of type XXXX sole prop, llc, corp, etc. ). Unsatisfied, they transferred me to a kindly young lady named XXXX at executive account resolution. Over the course of approximately 3 weeks, she was unable to provide any written disclaimer stating this was the practice of Capital One. As of today, she directed me to a statement that is located on the XXXX Bullet Point of the section titled "" Additional Terms and Conditions '', which states that we ( I and the business ), "" Authorize the receipt and exchange of credit information on XXXX the Business Signer and the Business, including the exchange of information between Capital One and affiliates ''. This is not a disclaimer relevant to my concern. If it had been known to myself that dual reporting to the XXXX credit agencies was to be expected, I would not have applied or accepted this credit offer.

She said she takes full responsibility for her actions and she will provide a letter stating what has happened so I can dispute it to the credit bureaus but I still have n't gotten the letter. 
The credit company raised my limit so I 'm no longer over the credit limit but that still does n't take away the intial hit on my credit and they need to take responsibility of this or do a reversal so it shows I never was over the credit. The company also hit my credit for a late payment even though I was n't late so they waived the late fee but that does n't take away the initial hit on my credit.

'' Since I had not activated my CapitalOne Venture card, as yet, I called the number provided. 
Now starts the problem. I called the number located in the XXXX and spoke with "" XXXX '' All this representative would do is repeat the same thing over and over again not really listening to my questions. She continued to read from her script asking me to resubmit all the information I had originally submitted in my application. No matter what I asked she wanted my "" SS number, date of birth, etc. '' Since I was getting nowhere I tried again a day later -Same thing this time with "" XXXX '' 15 minutes of repeating the same script. 
It was at this point I decided to write to CapitalOne in XXXX XXXX XXXX, UT. That was over 10 days ago - no answer to date. I have now decided to not activate my Venture card and just get my name off their records and close the account. 
Sounds easy right? Guess again.

Speaking to someone XXXX XXXX miles away, who in parrot like fashion, only repeats the same scripted sentence or XXXX over and over again is not what the buying public wants. In addition, expecting anyone to give personal information to an individual because they are using an XXXX type name ( with a heavy accent which is difficult to understand ) is not my idea of a sound business practice.

They are stating it is due to the fact that I had my pin number stored in my wallet.

I confirmed the activity was fraudulent and was issued a new card. I was told I would not be responsible for the charges. Then 10 days later I get my bill and the charges have not been removed. I was informed it was because the charges were still pending when the fraud claim was filed and it was my responsibility to call back. This is ridiculous for 2 reasons. 1. I was not told this on the initial call. 2. Capital One should develop a system to remove these type of charges without the customer waiting and calling back a second time. It seems like willful ignorance to not have a few fraud claims disputed. As I explained to the agent even a pen and paper would be a sufficient system to deal with these issues.

Capital One,"We have been a customer of Capital One for many years. My XXXX mother has been responsible for paying certain bills to allow her to remain financially independent ; however, her memory has been an issue of late, and I noticed that the Capital One bill was not paid timely. As soon as I saw this I paid the amount due of XXXX ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ). 

I reviewed to see why the payment was so high, as we do not use the card much and the minimum payments are normally XXXX. Due to the missed payment for XXXX and XXXX, Capital One increased our interest rate from 4.92 % to 29.40 %, effectively increasing the minimum payment from XXXX to XXXX ( more than doubled the minimum payment ). 

I called Capital One and spoke to several people who told me that per the "" Terms and Conditions '' they were unable to lower the rate on the card for XXXX months. However, it will be impossible for us to pay the minimum payment of XXXX. Essentially we will go delinquent due to this drastic rate increase. 

Up until this small issue, we have always paid on time. The fact that my mothers memory contributed to this makes it even more upsetting, as I can not now explain to her why the minimum payment has more than doubled, and we are on a fixed income unable to pay that drastic increase. 

All I have asked Capital One to do is put me back to the interest rate I have been at up until a couple of months ago. XXXX rate is robbery. We are good customers who paid in full once we realized there was a missed payment. It is unreasonable for Capital One to think that customers can pay such an interest rate, especially when we have been timely all along. 

My father went into the hospital on XXXX XXXX, thus I was not thinking about this bill at that moment, but as soon as I was made aware I paid the balance due in full ( XXXX ) I promised Capital One that I would put the account on autopay so that we do not run into this problem in the future if they would lower my rate back to what it was for years ( XXXX ) ; however the reps continuously told me that they were unable to change the rate, and that I would have to pay 29.40 % for 1 year before they would review. 

That is a difference of making {$1700.00} in payments in a year to {$4400.00}. All because we missed a payment and caught up as soon as I was made aware? I told Capital One that this account will go delinquent at 29.40 % -there is no way that we can financially afford to pay almost $ XXXX over the next year. Will they help us only when we go delinquent and ruin our credit? Is that the best answer? 

No, it is not. This rate increase is punishment for a late payment that is not in character of the account. It was a mishap due to my parent aging minds, and I do not want to embarrass them telling them that the reason the payment more than doubled is because they forgot to pay the bill. 

I am only asking that my rate be put back to what it was in XXXX. 4.92 %. We can then afford to pay the minimum payments. We can not at 29.40 %. 

Thank You.

Capital One,"I live in the state of VA and was unexpectedly hit with personal property taxes and only had 3 weeks to pay by the time I received the notice by mail. I was not prepared for this as I have not lived here in over 10 years. In order to resolve that issue some bills where not paid on time .. which would include the credit card for which I have the complaint with. My account is up to date and even though my payment was late it was not 30-60 days past due which is what they reported on my credit which had a very significant impact and I am currently trying to improve my credit in order to be able to buy a home. When I called them to discuss this and requested that they show me a courtesy of removing the delinquency from my credit as my account was paid and is up to date and this was the only instance for which I was late, as I always pay before my due date. I was told that they can not remove the delinquency from my report as they have no way of reversing the report they submit to the credit bureaus. I informed them that I have spoke with the credit bureaus and know that they can electronically respond to my dispute I made with them the previous day and the credit bureau stated once they receive that response it will up date immediately so if I need it removed soon to contact the company directly. So again the agent continues to repeat annoyingly over and over we can not change what we submitted unless we made the error. They proceeded to tell me if I had a dispute I would have to file it with them personally in writing and mail it to their dispute center and wait for them to review and make a decision which will take 30-60 days maybe up to 90 days. I kept explaining that their negative report affected me within a minute of them reporting it and can just as easily reverse it, if they would be willing to extend me that courtesy, however, they would not. I asked for another supervisor as the one I was talking to kept talking over me and saying the same thing over and over, she then placed me on hold for 15 minutes when another woman came on the line I explained the situation yet again. She stated well since you admitted to being a little late there was no error on our part, I said a little late is not 30-60 days delinquent but irregardless I was simply asking for a one time courtesy since I have never had a late payment ever and as a matter of fact they were always paid early. She agreed that this has never happened before on my account but still continued telling me that I would now need to submit my complaint in writing and mail it to them, even after I told her that I filed a dispute with the credit reporting agency and all they need to do is respond. When I mentioned I was filing a complaint with CFPB she then stated now I have to transfer you to the president line and immediately did so, and where I got a voicemail asking me to leave a name and number and a brief description of the issue. I only have 2 weeks before I loose the opportunity to refinance my vehicle from 12.99 % to 1 % and they are the only thing holding that up and the smallest account I have and giving me the biggest issue.

I called Capital One and they told me to do a "" search '' on their site for "" balance transfers '', only then did it state you could not transfer to another Capital One card. I believe this is very deceptive in their advertising and while the information was available it was not in any of the disclosures I received or in the "" compare '' screens. I am now left with a hefty APR and trying to find another card to transfer to. My complaint involves APR, Rate, Balance Transfer as well as Advertising and Marketing.

Capital One,"I am writing to dispute my Costco/retail services Capital One credit card. I found out my credit score took a significant hit from XXXX to XXXX since XXXX XXXX. This was alarming due to my score having been XXXX or greater for the last 10 years. My Credit Lender pointed out that it was due to a Costco account that has been delinquent since XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$150.00}. This amount reflects late fees on a yearly Costco membership that I was never notified of. My lender stated that he has seen this situation with other clients from time to time. 
Our situation is that we moved from XXXX, XXXX in XXXX XXXX. We have not used our Costco card since XXXX XXXX. Since our move, I personally had all mail forwarded to our new address in XXXX, XXXX. We have been receiving our normal bills with the yellow change of address labels affixed. Mysteriously we never received any notifications or bills from Costco/Capitol One. This was never a thought due to the card not being used in over a year. 
I immediately contacted Capitol One and spoke with a supervisor. I presented my case to her. After some review, she found that our mail was returned to sender ( Capitol One ). Not only was my mail returned, my account had been closed. I wrote a letter to Capital One credit department on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX without any resolution of removing this delinquency from my credit report. I am requesting that this be removed from my credit report and taken care of as soon as possible. As you can imagine this greatly affects the status of my loan aplication. As mentioned, my above credit score is a reflection of my timely payments to all of my creditors. As you will see in my payment history with Costco since approximately XXXX, I have never been delinquent. I hope you can see the uniqueness of this situation. I greatly appreciate your consideration.

When I researched the local, state, and national public records, it became abundantly clear they had willfully and intentionally lied to me about it.

Every time I contact them, they say it was charged because I did n't make the payment by a certain time on that day for it to post quickly. Even though the authorization shows it was made that day. No where on their paper statement does it say it has to be by a certain time on the due date. once again today I am contacting capital one about late fees on XXXX statements and I 'm getting the same run-around again. They are only willing to waive XXXX of the late fees. My point in the past is if I had mailed a check/money order dated or post-marked the due date, it would be accepted but my making a online payment ( which is faster ), is not acceptable for that date unless its ' by a certain time. None of my other credit card companies do this. I dont ' mind late fees if my payment action is actually late, not on the due date.

Capital One,"I had a business relationship with the owner of XXXX XXXX, XXXXOn or about XX/XX/XXXX, Capital One Bank ( USA ) N.A . made a solicitation to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Upon verification and approval, on the front of the credit card, the words "" Capital One Business Platinum '' are printed as well as "" XXXX XXXX, L '' ( LC ). On the reverse side, the words "" Capital One Small Business Solutions Center '' also appear. ( Exhibit XXXX ). 
2. Capital One 's Customer Agreement specifically states that this is a business account. Under the heading Business Purpose Account : "" Your Account is a business Account that must be used only for business purposes. '' Capital One states under the Account Information clause that : "" We maintain the right to restrict or close your Account if your information can not be verified or you do not provide additional information as requested. '' Capital One accepted the application for a business credit account under these terms. In filling out the application, it required my name, address and social security number. I did not provide the EIN number nor did Capital One contact me to verify the information or request that I provide the EIN number. 
( Exhibit A ) 3. It is alleged that Capital One has misrepresented itself and committed credit card fraud by leading me to believe that by applying and receiving this business account, I had corporate status protection as a limited liability corporation. At certain times, Capital One issued and billed the account to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ( Exhibits XXXX, XXXX ) 7. I filed legal action against officers of XXXX XXXX, XXXX in Federal Bankruptcy Court ( Exhibit XXXX ) and received judgment against officers of XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( Exhibit XXXX ). I continued making good faith payments after having been promised by XXXX XXXX, XXXX that they would reimburse me for business related expanse as well as all amounts owed. When it became clear that the owners of XXXX XXXX, XXXX were not going to reimburse me for business related expenses, I was no longer able to make good faith payments to Capital One and defaulted. 
8. Capital One has pursued this issue relentlessly. Capital One claims that I am personally responsible for the corporate account issued to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
9. Capital One filed a lawsuit on XX/XX/XXXX and continue putting pressure either settle or go to trial. I can not afford an attorney and continue to maintain that I have corporate status protection under a limited liability corporation. According to CAL. CORP. CODE 17101 : ... no member of a limited liability company shall be personally liable under any judgment of a court, or in any other manner, for any debt, obligation, or liability of the limited liability company, whether that liability or obligation arises in contract, tort, or otherwise, solely by reason of being a member of the limited liability company.

I called capital one since they are my credit card provider for XXXX accounts and let them know. I basically wanted some type of help. The only program they offered me was for 3 months they would waive my fees, but interest will still accumulate. The only advantage to the program is if I paid my payment late I would not get a late fee, but everything would still be reported to the credit bureau that I was past due and they will still be racking up on all the interest. I then asked to speak to a supervisor whos name was XXXX and his advice basically was let the account go past due and give us a call to see what we can offer you then. I am not sure whether this was legal or not, but it did not make since. I have been a loyal customer to them for 5 years and when I needed help it was basically do not pay, rack up fees and interest, and then we will help you. When I questioned XXXX on the fact he told me let your account go past due and then we will be able to offer you programs I was a little upset. Here I am trying to avoid not making payments, trying to work something out with them, and most importantly let it effect my credit and he did nothing to help nor at least empathize with me. We all struggle of course, but being a loyal customer to them I expected better help. I would have never thought to report capital one and I thought about it last night, but it just did not seem right to me. If I am trying to work something out so they see payments coming in I expected there help back instead of just trying to suck out fees from me.

Capital One,"I applied for a Capital One Credit Card online and received it w/ a {$3000.00}. limit. 
This was about XXXX. I wanted to take cash out and the ATM refused. I called and although I verified all the information, they xfered me to the Fraud Dept. because they think I am not who I say I am ( although I am and I have sent them the documents to prove it ). For awhile I was able to use it at stores as credit but then they restricted that. I kept going online to see when the first payment was due and all it said for the longest time was that the account was restricted. Finally it gave a due date of XXXX/XXXX/15 w/ a {$26.00}. minimum payment. I mailed {$50.00} at the end of XXXX but it never showed online. On XXXX XXXX I called and spoke to a man ( I think he said he was a detective but he is n't a very good XXXX ) and asked him why my payment was n't posted. He asked me the same questions over and over and I just wanted to know why my payment was n't posted. Well, he found the payment, posted it but he did n't backdate it and they charged me XXXX in interest and a {$25.00}. P/D fee. I have written them numerous letters and spoke to the Fraud Dept. several times but for some reason they think this is fraud and they have restricted the card and ruined my credit report. I have never denied the card is mine or the charges. I am making my payments on time. I have done everything to clear this.

They did tell me that I was eligible for a upgrade, they told me I could switch to the Visa Quick Silver Rewards or the Master Card Capital One Venture Card. I asked what the differences were and they advised me. They told me that they would remove the annual fee and advised that the Quick Silver Rewards would be a Visa card and I went online and looked online and saw it there and was like ok I will switch to the card with the hopes that some day by switching I could get a lower rate as it looked like online the rates for the Visa version were or could be lower so I made a decision based on that rather than the venture card. So I selected the Visa option. I was specifically advised that it would be a Visa Rewards cards and I would receive a new card in the mail and my old card would stay active until the new one arrived. I called spoke with Supervisor who explained it would not be the Visa because the minimum credit line for the Visa card was XXXX and the account number would not change and once again no lower interest rates available for the card I had. I explained I was told card would be switch to the Visa version, I adv that this is not correct I advised that my decision to accept upgrade was based on it switching to Visa and to which I was told too late now and there was nothing that could be done and it could n't be reversed.

Capital One,"Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, I like my Capital One products but there is a personal issue that is partially unresolved. It is partially resolved because Capital One was able to make monetary restitution to a credit card insurance scheme that I was paying. Capital One made misrepresentation of material fact by selling me products that supposed to cover credit card payments if I am unemployed or disable. I am currently having a successful career. However, I went to a very difficult time when I was experiencing hardship by being unemployed and collecting unemployment benefits. During those difficult times, I qualified for benefits as described under the terms of the Capital One benefits agreement. I was being harassed by Capital One on my cell phone to make payments. Some of those collection reps were condescending and rude. Maybe, it was a language barrier problem. They did not want to consider that I have insurance benefits that cover that type of hardship. 

Thank you.

Capital One,"This is both a billing and customer service issue. First let me state that the BBB gives a name of XXXX XXXX with a number of XXXX, with no access code, luckily I had XXXX.

To me this is a clear indication that she is, but they just wo n't put her on the phone. So for that I am also reporting this company to the FTC. 
My New issue is that Capital one credited me XXXX do to an error on their end XXXX they passed the blame off to XXXX XXXX XXXX, but the XXXX only covered the XXXX plus XXXX late fees and not the interest I ws promised. i called in yesterday, spoke with a supervisor who fixed that issue just fine. I told her I had just made a payment of XXXX via XXXX Saturday and that I will call back with the reference number, so that they could verify and release the funds unto my account. I called back in with the reference # but they stated that because my account was "" past due '' and "" in collections '' that they could not. My account should have never been placed in that status because it was in dispute and accoding to the FDCPA If, within thirty days after receiving written notice of the debt from the debt collector, you contact the company stating that you do not owe the money, the debt collector must stop contacting you. The debt collector may renew collection activities if you are sent proof of the debt, such as a copy of a bill for the amount claimed by the creditor. And that until proof is given I am NOT required to make payment. 
Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you have the right to sue a debt collector in state or federal court within one year from the date of the violation. If you win, you may recover damages in the amount of any losses you suffered as a result of the violation, plus an additional amount of up to {$1000.00}. You may also be able to recover court costs and attorney fees. I am hoping that it will not come to this, but you will not violate my FDCPA Rights, you will not hold my hard earned money and you will not disrespect me Capital ONE!

Billing cycle XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, 2015, Capital One gave me an additional credit for {$4300.00}, referring to this as a balance transfer adjustment - this additional transfer was a mistake and I called immediately to explain the additional funds were not mine as the fraudulent activity for that amount had been resolved.

Capital One,"I initially gave a merchant a down payment on Capital One MasterCard for the installation of a wood fence on my property. The fence was not completed but the company charged the remaining balance to MasterCard without my approval. I immediately contacted Capital One and they initially charged back the merchant I sent in a statement and an estimate for the completion of the fence by Capital One stated that they did not receive the estimate by the deadline. When I called Capital One about this they then stated that the estimate was not legible and closed the case. I called again about this charge and was told that since the dispute was closed MasterCard will not look into my claim again. MasterCard knowingly gave a crooked merchant unauthorized money after being told to stop the payment. I was ripped off by a thief with MasterCard 's help.

In XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I wrote a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX, the description of the letter was about "" I have never taken out a loan from Capital One Bank '', I requested them to verify the debt ; however, in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me another letter, the letter stated that they have completed their investigation of my dispute concerning my account. They have obtained and reviewed the attached documents related to this account, which establish its validity. I want to strongly point out that the attached document is Capital One Invitation that shows that when I first opened Capital One Bank account in year XXXX, I had provided my social security number, and my mother 's maid name. I 'm extremely irritated because they used the Capital One Invitation letter as their reason to claim that I owed {$3100.00}. I feel like Capital One Bank is trying to rob me. The Capital One Bank is harming me mentally and psychologically. I could n't sleep for days because Capital One Bank is trying to rob XXXX from me. Last but not least, I strongly emphasize that I do not owe Capital One Bank any money, not even a dime. 
My personal thought : when I received the first letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, I felt like it was very unusual. Debt collector tried to collect debt from me after many years later. I do not have Capital One Bank anymore. I destroyed my credit card when I paid off my debt. My highest debt back then was around XXXX {$.00}

Capital One,"I am past due on my credit card due to poverty. I submitted a payment towards my XXXX minimum payment for the XXXX of XXXX for XXXX dollars. By the XXXX, it had not been deducted out of my bank account, so I contacted the credit card company through online chat to cancel it so that I could pay for groceries. I was told that yes, they see the payment "" posted '' but they had not deducted it from my bank account. My minimum payment had been XXXX, but the XXXX dollars posted had also not been deducted from the XXXX. So, capital one had neither deducted the money from my bank account yet, nor intended to cancel the payment, nor had they cut my debt by XXXX dollars. The rep said "" cancel through your bank, because we ca n't refund it until we actually have it deposited '' and then agreed that, if I cancelled it through my bank, i would pay XXXX dollars today and XXXX by the end of the month. Instead, when I woke up at XXXX today, the credit card company had taken the XXXX dollars and still expected me to pay XXXX more dollars today and XXXX dollars by the end of the month. I can not get my bank to refund it. I tried to contact my bank last night but there reps were unavailable because it was XXXX. My money was not accessible to me, not through my bank or through capital one. Today, I had a rather unpleasant and dismissive chat with a credit card rep who told me that, not only would they not refund the XXXX, but it was now XXXX + XXXX today and XXXX by the end of the month. My credit card debt has still not dropped XXXX dollars, and they refused to give me a refund. They are holding my XXXX dollars hostage until I pay XXXX by the end of the month, at which point "" you can feel free to contact us again. '' They would not give me an answer as to the likelihood of ever getting back my XXXX dollars. They kept repeating to get my account current and then we could chat again. They were dismissive and circumnavigated around all my direct questions about consumer laws and written agreements. They said no refunds ... ..however, there 's a small chance we 'll reconsider this once we get paid, and your minimum payment for XXXX is now XXXX not XXXX. I said this was a breach of contract and they said they did n't keep records. So I saved the XXXX page chat and will submit it here, as they did repeat the minimum payment as being XXXX dollars by the XXXX and XXXX by end of XXXX in today 's chat ( the minimum payment was to be for XXXX, XXXX, and late fees, my usual payment is like XXXX dollars ). I found them to be intentionally misleading and too aggressive in their collection tactics. They refused to continue the chat and kept repeating "" we can discuss this when you get current with your payments '' and would not answer if I would, for certain, get a refund of my XXXX if I get current by the end of the month ... they also would not answer if they agreed they were breaching our written contract. They ended the conversation and I finally gave up trying to keep them online chatting with me, as they had tried to get off the chat for many minutes. 
The whole chat from today took XXXX minutes and the chat last night took an additional XXXX minutes ... .and they reneged on their written agreement and threatened to ignore me until I pay the XXXX today and XXXX by the end of XXXX. Then they really did ignore me and I was pressured into getting off chat, as they were not responding, but rather just copying and pasting the words "" we can discuss this when you get current '' into the chat box.

Capital One,"I applied for a card with Capital One with the intention of using the card to execute a balance transfer. During the online application process I was asked how much I wanted to transfer and my response was {$10000.00}. Shortly after I was approved for {$3000.00}. 

The next day I called Capital One and spoke to a lady in the applications department. I let her know that if Capital One was unwilling to raise my credit limit, then the card was no use to me. The lady explicitly told me that if I did not activate the card that meant that I had not agreed to the terms of the card and my account would NOT be reported to the credit bureaus. 

After receiving the card in the mail I did NOT activate it. Instead, I called customer service to confirm that if I did not activate the card, nothing would be reported to the credit bureaus. At that point I was informed by XXXX customer service representatives that what the lady had told me was false and that the account, although not activated, would still be reported to the credit bureaus. 

As a result of the false information that was given to me, I will certainly sustain damage to my credit file through a ) a hard inquiry b ) the opening and closing of this account in the same month and c ) a drop in the average age of my accounts, all three of which have a negative impact on my credit. 

Please note I still have not activated the card and have no intention of activating the card unless Capital One is willing to raise my credit limit to {$10000.00}.

Capital One,"Sometime in XXXX of 2015 I was approved for a Capital One Secured credit card requiring a deposit due within 80 days ( XXXX/XXXX/2015 ). I contacted Capital One on XXXX and processed the payment for the deposit ( {$200.00} ) and was advised it would take approximately 2-3 weeks to received my card. After a couple of business days, I realized the funds had n't been deducted from my account and I proactively reach out to Capital One on XXXX to understand the delay. I was advised the payment was n't processed due to some error. I was asked if I wanted to reprocess the payment but I wanted to be sure it would still be considered on-time as it was past the 80 day timeframe. The representative assured me it would be and so I authorized the payment from a different checking account. The funds were deducted from my account on the XXXX. On XXXX, I called to ensure funds had been received and that my application is being processed. To my surprise I was told as payment was received on the XXXX, beyond the 80 day timeframe, my funds were going to be refunded to me and it would take 10 business days. I requested to speak to a supervisor, who reviewed the account and acknowledge the company error and provided me with XXXX options, 1. submit a new application ( another credit inquiry impacting my credit ) and hopefully funds would be applied towards that application or wait until approximately the XXXX to be refunded. Both unsatisfactory options. I explain again that it was company error to no resolution.

Capital One,"I called my credit card co. to pay off my debt in full on XX/XX/XXXXl. I did, and then I received a refund from an online company that owed me {$58.00} and it posted to my credit card on XX/XX/XXXX as well ( it shows on the statement ). On my next bill, which I got today XXXX/XXXX/15, that refund was absorbed into some make believe charges that the credit card XXXX said I owed in interest, and that I still owed them an addtional {$4.00} and some change. I said why was n't that interest included in my payment when I paid off the credit card in full? They said it was to accrue over the entire month when my bill was actually due. 
Now mind you, my billing date is the XXXX of every month and I paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX. So, I was charged an entire month for interest on a bill I paid on the first, but they said it did n't matter and calculated what would accrue over the entire month up until XX/XX/XXXX. That seems pretty unfair. How is it collecting interest if it was paid off on the XXXX of the month 3 days after my last bill was due and paid for before XX/XX/XXXX, which I paid on XX/XX/XXXX, and it was more than the minimum amount due. So, I was charged about {$65.00} in additional charges after I paid my account completely off. I want someone else to explain this to me, or I am going to think I was penalized for paying my account in full.

Capital One,"I have been having negative financial issues with my bank ( Capital One ) concerning my line of credit on a credit card I have with them. This began in 2011, just after my husband passed away. I had credit XXXX cards with Capital One at that time. I had a credit line of over {$10000.00} on the first card. No sooner had my husband died, the credit limit on that card was brought down to {$500.00}. I also noticed Capital One was using my {$85000.00} mortgage on my house toward XXXX credit, which I understand is not supposed to be used for these purposes. I closed that first card. 
Two weeks ago I applied for a greater line of credit on the second card, which has a limit of {$5000.00}. I was denied the increase because "" Recent use of this account 's existing credit line has been too low. '' However, I have charged up to {$800.00} on this card in the past, and I have pristine credit including well over XXXX XXXX score ; pay all my bills on time ; pay the full amount ; never went into delinquency ; never made a low payment, and this account has never been past due. Also, Capital One did not tell me what a suitable charge amount is. 
I feel Capital One has been discriminating against me and its practices have been deceptive, especially since this all occurred after the death of my husband ( six months later ) whose finances were separate from mine. I have always had pristine credit. It appears also that my credit from other banks have not been harmed because of this issue with Capital One. I would like to know what options I have. Are they allowed to use my mortgage amount to determine the line of credit for a credit card?

Capital One,"On Tuesday XXXX XXXX, 2015 at approximately XXXX CST I was transferred to a Supervisor by the name of XXXX , Agent ID # XXXX.

XXXX ( supervisor for Capital One ) conferenced the Merchant 's Account Specialist by the name of XXXX XXXX to verify if the pending transaction could be released. XXXX XXXX authorized XXXX to release the hold. Upon releasing the hold, XXXX the representative for Capital One disclosed my available credit while the Merchant was on the line without my consent. As soon as the Merchant disconnected the line ; I brought to XXXX 's attention that she just violated my privacy by disclosing my available credit to an unauthorized Third Party. This act is a Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). XXXX apologized ( the apology was not sincere and was very nonchalant ). 
I asked XXXX to transfer me to her Manager in which she refused to do so. I advised XXXX, I have been a customer with Capital One for over eight years and I have spoken to several Managers in the past. I asked XXXX for Capital One 's Corporate Office 's telephone number so I could write a complaint. XXXX refused to provide the information. I asked XXXX 's for her Manager 's name and Agent ID Number which both was provided. XXXX 's Manager 's name is XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX. I asked XXXX several times to please transfer me to XXXX ; however, to no avail, XXXX declined. I asked XXXX to put in the request for XXXX to call me back but XXXX declined by stating, "" She can not put in the request for my Manager to call you back ''. I advised XXXX, she was not getting out of this situation and that I was going to continue to hold until I was transferred to a Manager. I also advised XXXX, she was going to lose her job behind this incident because I know the call was being recorded and she had done nothing but lie during our entire conversation. 
I passed the phone to my mother who advised XXXX, "" We were going to continue to hold until we were able to speak with a Manager ''. My mother and I asked to be transferred to the President of the Company 's but XXXX still would not provide the information. XXXX finally put me on hold and transferred me to another member of Management by the name of XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX. I advised XXXX of XXXX 's misconduct and violation of my privacy laws. XXXX agreed that XXXX should have not given my account information to the Merchant 's without my consent. XXXX provided me with the fax number to Capital One 's Complaint Department. I asked XXXX for her Manager 's name which is XXXX Agent ID # XXXX. I advised XXXX I was going to sue Capital One for this violation of my privacy rights. In addition, I asked XXXX for their Department 's Executive Vice President 's Name in which, XXXX responded and stated, "" I do not have this information ''. I advised XXXX, I find this unbelievable that she does not know the Executive Vice President 's Name and she is a member of Management. 
XXXX, "" Asked how she could remedy this instance that occurred today ''. I asked could she raise my credit limit XXXX stated, "" This has to be done through our credit increase department ''. XXXX offered to provide a {$50.00} statement credit for the inconvenience. I advised the credit would be sufficient. I asked XXXX, what ramifications the agent XXXX would receive for this privacy violation? XXXX stated, "" She would give the proper feedback to the agent ''. I advised XXXX, the agent should be terminated because if I had violated a consumer 's privacy at my company I would lose my job. I also asked for XXXX to partner with me and review the call.

I WILL EXPECT A CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT IN THE AMOUNT OF {$330.00} WITHIN 5 BUSINESS DAYS. Listed below is a detailed account of each dispute with your Transaction Rebills listed below each one.

Capital One,"In XX/XX/XXXX i had a previous social security number card ending by XXXX where the social security got my information wrong.The first name appear as last name and last name as first name and the date of birth was also wrong. ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) .I went to the social security office to correct the mistake, instead they assigned me a new number with my right information ending by XXXX.Since XX/XX/XXXX to present that 's the only i am using to work and apply for credit card with XXXX, XXXX, and capitalone.The previous card ending by XXXX has been surrounded to the social security office for cross reference and retirement.I am filing complaint against capitalone because i am so concerned about how they handling my personal information, starting with sms and email they addressing to XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX.I do n't know why it cause a problem to send email by using my entire name XXXX XXXX.I would like to verify the social security number capital one has on file.And also recently they have mailed me a replacement cards with the chip already been activated.I should be the only one to activate this product by using the last XXXX digit number of my social security number if it was n't any problem.

Capital One,"I currently have a credit card account with Capital One, and the have increased my APR to a whopping XXXX!! This practice is another example of a finance company running amock with corporate greed and consumer fraud. Capital One claims they offer competitive rates. Not so, because XXXX only charges me an APR rate of only 9.99 %! Hence, the are guilty of false advertising and other unethical business practices. Recently, I filled out an extremely negative customer survey report. XXXX, from Marketing and Research, called me while I was taking my car to a body shop for a damaged car estimate. She hounded me for my personal feedback. Should this be considered a reasonable business practice? I think not. 
Therefore this constitutes both an invasion of privacy and harassment! XXXX, from customer service, did not have my consent to call me and challenge my right to free speech. 
Finally, Capital One must also be held accountable for poor business practices, customer service incompetence, and the scheme of assigning false identities to their customer service reps in the XXXX. On every occasion whenever they have answered my customer service calls, they have referred to themselves as either XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX. I believe this criterion represents identity theft, which falls within the guidelines of consumer fraud. Also, whenever I have requested that each of my calls be transferred to someone in the United States, the outsourced representative has either hung up on me or has simply dispatched my call to an automated dumping ground, which usually results in my call being terminated. Can one of their corporate executives please justify this practice?

Capital One,"In XXXX, I believe I had completely paid of my Kohl 's Charge account. In order to check, I logged into my online account there. As I did not recall my account information, I had it sent to the email address which I had been receiving statement reminds at. I then logged in and saw that I was entirely paid up. Unfortunately, there was a bug in their system which caused me to login to a prior account with Kohl 's which had been closed. Since then they have fixed this bug, and require the Kohl 's card number rather than email address, so I get directed to the proper account. This issue was made worse by the fact that I moved around that time, so did not receive any written notices. 

In XXXX XXXX, I was denied credit, so went and looked at my credit statement, and found the derogatory information. I immediately called up Kohl 's to determine what had happened. After over a dozen phone calls between them and debt collection agencies, it was determined that they had lost my account and I should call back in a month. A month later, and many more phone calls, I successfully was put in touch with a collection agency and paid off my account with them. 

Since then, I have disputed the account with the credit agency and with Kohl 's directly. In XXXX XXXX, After receiving a written form letter from Kohl 's with a contact number, I attempted to contact them. I have left at least half a dozen messages on their voicemail, but have never received a response.

Capital One,"I lost my business in the recession and ended up with a judgment filed in court for a Capital One credit card debt. 2 1/2 months ago, XXXX XXXX, 2015, I paid off the judgment with Capital One.

Capital One,"XX/XX/XXXX I applied for Capital One Card XX/XX/XXXX received an email that my card shipped However, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating "" we have been trying to reach you because we think a fraudulent credit card account may have been opened '' I 'm not sure who they were trying to reach as I received no calls, emails, or other correspondence outside of this. XX/XX/XXXX I contacted your office and spoke to XXXX who I verified my full name, DOB, SSN, and full address for She indicated that what I provided was not enough information to verify my identity ( not sure how when those are standard HIPAA verification questions ) She requested my number and advised that it was n't acceptable she even requested my partner 's number ( who is n't on the account ) to verify which was n't acceptable either When I inquired what acceptable verification information was needed I was told she couldnt release that information She indicated I would have to go into a branch and verify my identity I requested all of this information in writing ( which has not been received ) On XX/XX/XXXX while setting up a joint savings account with my partner the system indicated that I already had an account ( not sure how when I never received a card ). I proceeded to call customer service and first spoke to XXXX who advised that I would need to send in a copy of my ID, a check stub, and utility bill to verify my identity ( I was not told this during the first call ). I then requested that the account be cancelled at which time XXXX transferred me to her supervisor XXXX. XXXX indicated that the card was under restriction and I would have to call Mon. and speak to a manager to cancel the card when my partner inquired why there was a restriction and why no one would provide us with information she advised her she was n't authorized on the account I advised XXXX that we were on speaker and I was still on the line She stated she couldnt verify my identity and disconnected the call! All I 've been trying to do is determine if someone else received the card and if they have been using it. No one will give me any information even though I 've requested the information in writing 
"
Capital One,"My CapitalOne credit card was restricted and flagged for identity fraud. I sent in the required paperwork but did not want to send in a bill statement or a bank statement. I had my bank draft a letter with the information Capital One was requesting, but they say they could not accept it. Their policy would only accept a non-doctored bank statement. I could n't even cancel or end my card until this issue was resolved. I was forced to hand over personal information that went beyond verifying my identity. I do n't know how they were going to use it or what it would be used for or how the information would be protected. This is a corrupt policy and should be stopped. I hope that no one else has to hand over such sensitive information any more to CapitolOne.

Capital One,"Hello, I have been a client with Capital One since XX/XX/XXXX however ; my credit reporting is only reflecting from XX/XX/XXXX and on. My overall credit rating took a hit since my history is not being reported in full. I ask that you report my credit in full since opening this card in XX/XX/XXXX. Let me know if you have any questions. 
"
Capital One,"on XXXX/XXXX/2015, Capital One Bank did not report the correct balance on my account. The company claim they report every month, but it still shows that I owe them XXXX dollars, which for XX/XX/XXXX I only owe XXXX dollars, which is my balance. The company is reporting inaccurate data to credit bureaus XXXX. XXXX and XXXX. So I decided to file a compliant. 
"
Capital One,"This complaint pertains to the direct mail marketing practices of Capital One. Although under the Constitution companies and individuals have the right to free speech, i.e., the right to solicit consumers, solicitation of financial products including those containing partially completed applications and especially if "" pre-approved '' can in today 's world cause harm if they fall into the wrong hands as well as place a burden on the recipient with respect to their proper destruction. As a result, they are not the same as the weekly ad that comes from the supermarket. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I sent a "" permanent '' "" Opt-out '' form from the XXXX XXXX XXXX to the XXXX, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IL XXXX. The form was honored in a timely fashion by XXXX and XXXX. Experian conveniently ignored this request until I filed a complaint through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this year. 
Since the beginning of XXXX I have been receiving unsolicited offers of credit from Capital One for their XXXX Rewards and XXXX Rewards cards sometimes on almost a monthly basis ; scans of the front of the envelopes for XXXX of these are attached ( CapitalOneXXXX ). Most of these offers have been addressed to my legal name but recently a "" fictional '' name has been used either separately or in parallel with my real name so that sometimes XXXX offers a month are received. This "" fictional '' name uses the initials of my Middle and Last Name and my First Name as my Last Name, i.e. Middle Initial/Last Name Initial/First Name as Last Name. Nowhere does that name appear on any of my credit reports ; I have NEVER used that name for any purpose or granted anyone permission to use that name with any of my personal information for any purpose. I would hope that use of that name would NOT allow a person to gain XXXX clearance, apply for insurance, get an XXXX refund etc. when used in conjunction with my address let alone obtain credit. If this name is that of a "" real '' person THEY DO NOT RESIDE AT MY ADDRESS and THE USE OF THIS NAME MAY BE PART OF AN IDENTITY THEFT. 
Having recently reported an Identity Theft to both the FTC and the Sheriff there could be someone who has created this "" fictional '' person and is using my address for nefarious purposes. The so-called "" Identity Protection '' company XXXX has also sent solicitation by mail to my address using this name. Based on previous experience I know that Capital One 's unsolicited offers will continue unabated month after mind-numbing month for many years to come. 
If a person has not responded after XXXX or XXXX offers, why would they respond after XXXX, XXXX, XXXX or more? I do not exaggerate when I state these numbers of offers. 
Prior to the financial crisis of XXXX I was also relentlessly marketed by Capital One, including offers for "" XXXX '' branded credit cards ostensibly based on the spelling of my last name and their guess as to my heritage. While there is no law against this type of grotesque and to some people possibly offensive ethnically-based marketing, the long-term tactics that Capital One has used are deeply troubling and over the many years have the effect of "" stalking '' given their sometimes deeply personal nature and relentless regularity. 
I 've seen Capital One 's ads on TV. If I want a credit card I will research it and apply as I see fit. Based on Capital One 's behavior I would not do business with them and have NEVER responded to any of their offers. 
"
Capital One,"Made about {$90.00} charges on Capital One credit card in XXXX of XXXX. I forgot that I had charged anything on the card, because this is my emergency card, and did n't pay until XXXX of XXXX, when I got the report that I had a 30 day past due account from my credit monitoring. I called, talked to the representative, offered to make {$120.00} dollar payment to bring the account to {$0.00} balance, she accepted. Evidently, she did not adjust off the less than {$1.00} service fees that remained, nor did she tell me they were there, nor did she note anything on my account. She said it would take XXXX to XXXX statement cycles to show everything current. 
Still not correct in XXXX, called back in, and they adjusted off service fees since payment in XXXX, and was told that it would take XXXX to XXXX statement cycles to show everything current. Credit report as of XXXX shows payments in XXXX and XXXX were 30 and 60 days late. 
Called back in XXXX to get credit report fixed, and am told that they can fix XXXX, but not XXXX. Agent agreed that it was their fault, but said that she had already gone above and beyond what she was supposed to do and could do no more. I asked to be sent to someone who could resolve this for me, and she said she was the most senior person that I could talk to, but I could send a letter to their general correspondence address. 
"
Capital One,"CapitalOne has sent me numerous "" Pre-approval '' offers. The letter reads in bold that I am "" pre-approved for this offer with no annual fee and our lowest intro APR. '' But further down on the back of an accompanying sheet of paper, it explains that a Pre-approved credit card offer is sent to a "" well-qualified group of people. Being pre-approved means you meet out initial criteria '' It seems to me that this is "" Pre-screened '' not "" Pre-approved '' 
"
Capital One,"I have been given incorrect information by XXXX different Capital One employees, and I do not feel that my complaint will be handled accurately. I have requested to fill out HIPPA Form to receive copies of my calls and was told that is illegal. I am requesting your assistance to help me resolve my issue. 
My first complaint is that I am being charged over and excessive amounts for my cash advance and have been given different information by XXXX different people : I spoke with XXXX supervisors regarding paying off my cash advance so that I can stop accruing interest. I am currently interest free on purchases. I spoke with a supervisor in XXXX XXXX to go over amounts I needed to pay. Next, I spoke with supervisor XXXX in the XXXX, FL office on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I called Capital One to have a late fee waived because I have never been late on my account. I spoke with XXXX and as a courtesy he waived the fee. We discussed in great detail the amount I would need to pay, in order to pay off the {$600.00} cash advance and stop accruing interest. I asked him very specific questions about my account. He said I would need to pay {$880.00}. I paid {$900.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I called in on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX to see what would be available and a rep advised me the full {$900.00} would be available at XXXX, because I satisfied the cash advance. Only {$860.00} became available, so I called back in and spoke with supervisor XXXX, to discuss what applied to the account, and she said I would need to pay an additional {$47.00} in order to pay off cash advance. I stated that was incorrect and excessive. She explained I had a previous balance of {$100.00}. I explained that is part of next month payment which according to XXXX I would not have to pay because cash advance would be satisfied. I explained to her that XXXX and the supervisor before him gave me great detail on what I needed to pay. I did not have XXXX 's name and location at the time I spoke with XXXX. Once I found his info, I called back in spoke with supervisor XXXX and she requested I file a complaint in writing after XXXX told me she had already submitted my complaint. I am furious, as a consumer, this information is difficult for me to understand, but what do I do when the employees of the company obviously do n't understand, have no knowledge of their products, and are obviously not on the same page??? 

My Second Complaint is that I was advised that I would be interest free for 1 year by signing up for the card, and XXXX advised me that I am only interest free for 10 months ending XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
"
Capital One,"Capital One has refused to protect my credit card ( MasterCard ) from fraud. An online company charged my credit card more than a dozen times, more than {$2000.00}, without my authorization and after I had expressly forbade them to do so in an email. This continued for three months, XXXX through XXXX, 2015. First I demanded that they close my account, and they said they would, but charges continued to come on my credit card account, so obviously they kept my account open against my wishes. I demanded they close the account three times by telephone, and they blocked my account online so I could n't close it myself. I reported this to Capital One, and asked them to block payment to this company, but they refused to do that, which would have solved the problem the very first time a new charge came through. As an alternative, they offered to refund my account, and asked for documentation for my claim. I gave them written emails and pages from the online company 's website which proved that I had ordered them to cease charging me two months earlier, and I refuted with documentation every lie that this fraudulent online company countered with. But Capital One refused to protect my credit card from fraud. I had to cancel my credit card number to stop the online company finally, and now I have cancelled my Capital One account altogether. They do not care about their customers, and anyone who accepts a credit card from them will regret it. Capital One will not protect you against fraud.

Capital One,"My husband lost his job and I was unable to pay my credit card payment for some time. After my account charged off Capital One has sent my account to a collection agency XXXX Attorney 's at Law. I began making token payments every few months and I got a letter from XXXX stating that as long as I continued to pay according to the agreement that we had made they would not take my account to court. I have never spoken on the phone with them, I have never made any sort of arrangements with them. So I continued to make payments when I could, as much as I could. I did not get monthly billing statements, I did not even know what my balance was at any given time. In XXXX 2015 I did finally get a bill stating that I owed {$1100.00} on my account and for XXXX my husband paid off my account for me on XXXX/XXXX/2015. To my horror I just discovered that this firm has filed suit against me in court Case XXXX. To my knowledge my account, although previously charged off, should be paid in full and should be reporting as such to the credit agencies now. I feel that this is a violation of UDAAP as it was deceptive to pretend that they had entered into some sort of an agreement with me without ever speaking with me. I feel it is abusive to continue to collect a debt and even file suit against a debtor that has paid off their account. I feel that it is unfair to not send monthly billing statements to a customer and expect them to know what is owed on a loan. Service providers for large banks should be held to the same standard as the big banks. 
"
Capital One,"My complaint involves Capital One. Originally, this was a GM credit card, previous to Capital One acquiring the account. Once this account was acquired by Capital One, I experienced constant problems with this company. There are several issue 's with this company, these issue 's have escalated to the point of being unreasonable. Formal and legal disputes have been made by me. Against my better judgement, I spoke to an representative XX/XX/2015, and reached an agreement with this individual. I gave verbal permission for XXXX payments to be automatically deducted from my checking account. ( I was told this conversation was recorded. ) And in fact three {$59.00} payments were deducted from my account, in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX 2015. On XX/XX/XXXX, I realized that Capital One had not honored their part of the agreement. I placed a call to the company, a representative and a supervisor, both admitted to listening to the recording, but could not explain why this company had not honored the agreement. I was assured that there would be a complete investigation and someone would get in touch with me, within 10 days. ( which never happened. ) Once again, I called this company and was told that a payment had not been received on this account in over 120 days. When questioned this individual could not answer any questions, she could only state what was on her computer screen. XX/XX/XXXX, an individual called my home, basically demanding a payment or a payment arrangement. When the situation was explain to this individual, he stated that he would put a 10 day hold on the account, so there would be no late charges added to the account. My payments had always been made through the capital one website. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was blocked from my account, which prevented me from making any type of payment. I made yet another call to Capital One and I was transferred three times, due to no one being able to answer my questions. Finally I was told to call a different number. A XXXX, informed me that my account had been closed, then charged off and had been put up for sale. Yet, he still wanted me to make a payment during that phone call. Capital One has flat out refused to supply information, that was formally and legally requested. They have lied during every single phone call. This company is unscrupulous, unethical, lying thieves. Yet, they seem to enjoy threatening, many attempts at intimidation. It is ridiculous how this company believes that they are beyond the law and can flat out refuse to explain and/or justify charges. This company has received a payment on this account every single month. This can be proven through bank records. Due to the fact, that I have caller ID, I can prove that there was no follow up call, to address my questions. This is just a small example of the most recent issue 's that I have encountered with this company. There are many more. My biggest question to the company would be, If in fact, Capital One, is a fine, upstanding, legitimate company who follows all law and regulations, if in fact they have nothing to hide, why have they refused to supply the detailed information that has been requested? I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am not the only consumer who has experienced this type of treatment from this company. I am considering legal action, in addition to filing formal complaints with the Attorney General 's Office.

Capital One,"I filed bankruptcy which was discharged in 2014. Capital One reported this as discharged when the discharge took place. Capital One continues to post new negatives on my credit report monthly even thought this account was discharged and the credit card was cancelled. I know the initial negative will stay on my credit report for 7-10 years. Is Capital One allowed to continue reporting new negative information? If so, this new negative will stay on my credit report way past the 7-10 year time frame. How do I make this stop?

Capital One,"I had a secured credit card with a limit that i deposited of XXXX and had made a few payments from my personal bank account.

Capital One,"Due to job loss back in 2008 I could not pay all my debts. I had contacted the Capital one company and told them I could not pay and to close my account. My credit limit was only {$500.00} and I had not maxed the balance out, but was paying on the balance. I discovered 2 years later that my balance had jumped from {$370.00} to $ XXXX!!! When I contacted Capital one, I was advised that because I had not been paying my balance timely enough, that the charges were continued late fees, penalties and interest! I understand late fees and some interest, but how in the world could anyone pay off a balance with no job when they continue to increase with no cap? I tried to negotiate with them to have me pay off the balance at a set fee, but they still would not allow the negotiation. It still remains on my credit today and after many calls they will not agree to anything! It is not as though I have n't tried over and over, but the charges are excessive and unfair.

Capital One,"I hired a XXXX to perform at my client appreciation party on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
The company charged me the {$3500.00} for it on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and it posted on my Capital One credit card on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and I paid the charge. I then was charged another {$3500.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX and he apologized and said he would talk to the accounting dept and take care of it. I then called another number that was on my original invoice and it was an attorneys office, I told him what happened and he said he was going to see them that day and that he would have them take care of it. Two days past and the company never refunded the money. I called them again and talked to XXXX ( who was in the mtns ) and stated that if he did n't remove the extra charge that I would file a dispute with Capital One. So on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I call capital one to explain what had happened, filed a dispute and they removed the charge..pending investigation. 
Then on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Capitol One rebilled me {$3500.00} and said I didnt respond to their paperwork request ( which I have proof that I did ) so I went ahead and REsent it to them on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX @ XXXX. During that time, XXXX XXXX ( the owner of XXXX '' had been arrested and a XXXX XXXX Jury has indicted him and his girlfriend "" the accountant '' for XXXX of money laundering, theft, forgery and fraud. Click on the following link for the article : XXXX I forwarded all this information in my paperwork to Capital One and they once again REMOVED the charge on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. THEN on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Capital One REBILLED me the {$3500.00} stating that the company had provided XXXX receipts to back up the XXXX charges so they sided with them and put the charge back on. I spent 3 hours on the phone with them on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX being sent from the fraud dept to the dispute dept, had to explain my story to a least a dozen people, they then sent me the receipts they had and they were CLEARLY not my signatures, I then provided 3 forms of ID with my signature on it to prove that, they agreed it wasnt my signature however, now they want more information from me. I have done EVERYTHING they have asked and it is more than evident that I too was a victim of this company 's fraud however, CAPITAL ONE CC continues to victimizing me by repeatedly removing this charge and then adding it back on even though I have proven to them it WAS FRAUD! I have been in contact with the XXXX DA to add my case to the counts again XXXX XXXX and XXXX but I need help getting Capital One to work with me and stop charging me over and over. I have asked to speak to Supervisors which they get on the phone but I have to keep explaining my story and once I think its resolved ... .they charge me again and they clearly know this second charge for {$3500.00} is FRAUD. What can I do to stop being a victim to Capital One?

Capital One,"In the case of XXXX different credit card companies, I paid off my entire balance in XXXX 2016 and yet got charged finance charges/interest for this month, XXXX 2016. I called both Capital One and XXXX XXXX and was told, "" interest charges accrue daily, were n't reflected in your balance due, so you still owe these fees. '' I paid them each around {$10.00} "" interest '' but I do n't understand, how can one pay on time, pay off the entire balance and still get charged interest while having a zero balance? In the past, after I paid off the balance of a credit card, that was the end of any charges. 
"
Capital One,"I became XXXX XXXX and make less than XXXX % of the federal poverty level. I contacted Capital One regarding my credit card ending in XXXX and made hardship arrangements where they would stop charging me interest and fees as long as I made {$110.00} a month payments. 

They reneged on this agreement and have been charging me over {$75.00} a month since I began hardship repayment. Because of this, the balance is not getting any lower. I feel I have no choice now but to let the account be written off and pay a reduced amount to the third party collector who purchases the account in the future. I contacted Capital One and they raised the minimum monthly payment and also said they would not stop charging interest. 

Capital One should be reprimanded for unethical collection and repayment schemes. 
"
Capital One,"I requested paperless billing for a Capital One card account. Not only did the account go paperless, but it became "" contact-less '' and "" notification-less ''. In fact, the communication just went "" dark '' ( no communication ). It only "" lit '' back up once I realized I missed a payment by over 30 days. This, of course, created a late payment note on my credit report and trashed my credit score. 
As a XXXX, I have worked extremely hard to do all I can to support my credit score. This is a huge setback. Additionally, the credit reporting/score system makes no distinction between missed payments ( due to being a deadbeat ) and missed payments caused by a logistical issue. Basically I appear to be a deadbeat to lenders. 
Yes, I am responsible for the payment of the account. There was no history ( until this logistical issue - "" darkness '' ) where the account was paid late. The account is, once again, paid on a timely basis. I do n't feel like I should be penalized for the lack of contact by Capital One. 
I, immediately, reactivated paper statements. I, immediately, verified Capital One had my correct phone & e-mail contact info ( which they did ). 
I had also requested paperless statements for several other credit card accounts ( including a Menard 's Big Card - serviced by Capital One ). All other accounts continued contacting me via ( automatic ) e-mail message alerts including "" payment due '' and "" statement available ''. Why was Capital One allowed to risk my credit score by failing to contact me regarding payments due and statements available??? 
In my opinion, Capital One failed me. We spent XXXX ( if not XXXX ) of US tax dollars to create the CFPB. I hate that spending, however, I hate having my credit score, innocently, attacked even more.

Capital One,"An account in my name was opened with Capital One. The account became delinquent, and I was taken to court. Even though I did not open the account or give permission for this account to be opened I was held accountable. My wages were garnished, I 'm ok with this because it ended up being a family member that opened the account. My wages were garnished, and the account was satisfied, and the case was taken off of the docket. Several months later, the funds were given back to me. I did not ask for the funds they just showed up. I called Capital One to inquire about the funds and I as simply told that the case was closed and the case was taken off the docket. 
Several months later, I received a letter stating that the funds were once again going to be taken from me, and I was being garnished again for the same funds that were returned to me! Only this time the amount was more than twice the original amount that had already been paid ( and returned ). When I called XXXX and XXXX, the attorneys handling the case, the only information they would give me is the returning date for the case when they pick up the wages that had been garnished. This is unfair and deceptive! The funds were returned to me and now I am being made to pay for funds that had been paid? 
Please contact me for more information and specifics to this case.

Capital One,"I had my identity stolen and several Credit Cards opened in my name. XXXX of those was a Kohls card. I called and talked to a person at the fraud department at Kohls and explained what happened. I filled out all the paper work and was told they would investigate and it would be cleared up. This account was opened in a city over 10 hours away from me in a store, by a person with a fake ID of me. They told me it was clear I had not opened this account and that it would be cleared up. However the account was never removed and is now delinquent.

Capital One,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I applied for a credit line increase on my Capital One card. I received a letter from Capital One that states they are unable to increase my credit line right now due to my credit score. On the disclosure it states that my credit score was pulled on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which is more than 90 days ago. I called in and spoke with a customer service representative who told me that if that was n't my score I needed to dispute it with XXXX. I explained to the customer service rep ( XXXX ) that I am aware through prior conversations that Capital One only does soft inquiries every 45-60 days or so, but it takes some time for it to populate to the credit line increase system. I was looking to find out when the next set of scores were going to populate as my Capital One Credit Tracker service has shown since XXXX my credit score has gone up allot and I believe based on my current credit scores that I would qualify for an increase. He told me that my billing cycle is every month on the XXXX. At this point, he clearly did not understand what I was asking so I asked to speak to a manager ( XXXX ID # XXXX ) who I explained the same thing to. He told me that on the letter there is a number for Equifax that I can call to dispute my credit score at. I again stated "" Your letter says CAPITAL ONE obtained my fico score on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that was more than 90 days before I applied for the increase, I already have a copy of my updated score and it has gone up significantly, I would like to know on what day your system is going to update '' he responded that it depended on my dispute. At this point I was frustrated with his lack of knowledge, being a manager and not knowing basic Capital One policies is unacceptable to me as a client. It really does n't give me comfort knowing that a manager at capital one doesnt understand what I am asking or have any idea what I am talking about.

My account has never been late. The representative informed me that they could not offer any assistance until my account became 60 days late. I was livid and began to complain and spoke to a supervisor. Fast forward after being late, Capital one contacted me. They informed me they would reinstate my account if I brought the account current and delete the previous lates. I brought the account current and they reinstated my account but never deleted the lates. if a consumer contacts a creditor before being late, there should have been something that could have been done.

Then on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I discovered the card was closed. I called Capital One, and they said it was closed due to lack of XXXX documentation. I offered to send the XXXX, just as I did in XXXX, and Capital One sent me an e-mail link to a website where I could upload the XXXX. The person I spoke with on XXXX XXXX led me to believe the account could be reopened once the XXXX was squared away. I called today, XXXX XXXX, to follow up, as my account was to have been expedited. The representative today told me my account was closed because I failed to accept an offer they sent me in the mail recently. I recall the offer, and nowhere in that letter did it say my card would be closed if I made no selection. After escalating the call, I was told there was no hope of resurrecting the account or recovering the over XXXX rewards miles associated with it. After stating that I would file a federal complaint, I was transferred to a "" manager '' who said maybe the account could be opened, maybe it ca n't, and she does n't know why I 've been getting different stories at every call.

Capital One,"Capital One hid from me the fact I would lose XXXX airline miles when I cancelled my $ XXXX membership Capital One card ( to get double miles ). Three days later, I realized I had n't redeemed them and called. They were sorry but the account was closed. But, they could offer me {$1100.00} or XXXX equivalent points for hotels thru XXXX. I took the latter. However, upon redemption of my "" points, '' identified on the card in dollar amounts I discovered any balance or remainder was forfeited or lost. Using a {$200.00} card, for example, if the charge was {$90.00}, I lost {$110.00}. The remainder was forfeited by Capital One/XXXX without my knowledge or agreement. 
These XXXX companies have attempted to defraud me of approximately {$600.00}. 
Fortunately, XXXX CC is aware of these companies. 
Fundamentally, the equivalent value is somewhat skewed. 
XXXX airline miles, taken from me without my knowledge, is worth much more than was was offered me by Capital One. 
They have defrauded me along with their partner, XXXX. 

To add insult to injury, XXXX, partnered with Capital One, have charged my credit card account for additional funds without my knowledge or approval. 
As soon as I notified my CC company, XXXX, they almost chuckled as they immediately agreed with me, fraud. 
No questions asked. 
Apparently these XXXX companies have a reputation for this sort of thing.

Capital One,"I am a senior citizen and to make ends meet took a partime job as purchasing manager for XXXX XXXX. They would transfer funds into my Capital One credit card account with a {$5200.00} credit limit. Once the funds cleared, I would purchase items on the CC up to the amount of the transfer. I called Capital One to confirm if the funds had cleared. They advised me that the funds were available. XXXX separate transfers were made about a week apart. I coordinated the purchases for {$9200.00} through the Fraud Dept of Capital One to make sure the CC was not denied. The Capital One Fraud Dept cleared all of the purchases. About a week later I receive a notice that my CC account was overdrawn by almost {$8000.00}. I asked how that was. Capital One explained that the funds that were transferred, the account they were transferred from was overdrawn and funds were unavailable. I asked how that could be since both Capital One and their Fraud Dept cleared the transfer and allowed the purchases. The CC rep said the funds actually did n't clear but were posted to my CC acount because I was such a good customer for over 15 years. I asked them to remove the charges from my account. They refused. I then filed a police report with the XXXX County Police Dept. Report # XXXX. I then called the Ohio Attorney Generals Office who referred me to the Controller of the Currency who referred me to Consumer Finance.

Capital One,"I recently took out a capitol one venture card. Within 3 day of actually having the card in my possession, capitol one put the card on fraud alert. To resolve the issue they asked me to upload a copy of my social security card and drivers license ( front and back ) to a capitol one 'secure ' portal. The representative I spoke with stated capitol one gladly accepts screen shots, as though my social security card and drivers license are funny text messages I am trying to send to my XXXX XXXX XXXX nephew. I did this and the next day I received a phone call from a capitol one representative starting that if I wanted the fraud hold to be removed so that I could pay the balance on the card, I would have to go into my own personal bank and do something she referred to as a 'verbal verification '. For this verbal verification I went to my personal bank, called capitol one, and let them speak with a representative at my bank on my phone. The bank representative then gave the capitol one representative a phone number to call, at which point they ended the call on my phone and the capitol one agent called the bank representative at the number given to them. They asked the bank to confirm that I had a state authorized drivers license and to confirm that it was in fact me on the state authorized drivers license. I sent them a legitimate copy of my social security card and drivers license to capitol one under the pretense that this would resolve the problem. It eludes me at to why this was n't enough information. But to add insult to injury, the only way that crapitol one will allow me to pay off the balance remaining on the credit card is by giving them the account number to my account at my personal bank. Through all of this, every crapitol XXXX representative I 've spoken with has literally sounded like a character in the movie 'straight out of Compton ' with extremely bad grammar and interpersonal skills. I have very good credit primarily because I am graduate student with virtually no credit. The fact that the company has taken me through the ringer for a card I had for three days is astounding considering my ex felon of a fiance has XXXX capitol one cards with no issues what-so-ever. I truly believed that what happened with capitol one was n't at all for my best interest but rather unnecessary red tape set up to cover their own XXXX. Building credit to live the American dream should NOT be this difficult. I will more than likely give capitol one my account number inform my bank and put a lock on my credit. But the fact that I have to take such measures to assure that capitol one and their wonderful customer service reps do n't truly XXXX me over is discouraging to say the least and goes against all that it beautiful and consumerist in this great nation. Maybe some day when I am PhD drowning in student loan debt curing XXXX to keep the wealthy CEO 's of capitol one forever young, I will be able to laugh at how ridiculous this whole situation was. I hope, however, that swift justice will be delivered to drains on our national economy like capitol one well before any of this ever happens.

The card they issued fraudulently was frozen, and I 've since closed this account and placed an alert in my credit file. I 'm troubled that Capital One would not provide me, as a victim, with documents and information related to this fraudulent transaction using my personal information as required under the FCRA. I asked the name ( s ) of the person who requested to be added to my account along with the email address ( es ) and billing address ( es ) they attempted to use but was told by the representative that I could simply file a police report using the case number they gave me.

In their letter they stated "" Based on your application information, despite our attempt to reach you, we have been unable to resolve a consumer alert you placed for access to your credit bureau report. '' I did place an alert because my credit card was compromised. 

They also stated in their report that my XXXX XXXX credit score was XXXX, dated XXXX/XXXX/2016. Just below that they wrote, "" Key factors that adversely affected your credit score : Serious delinquency ; too many accounts with balances ; proportion of balances to credit limits on bank/national revolving or other revolving accounts is too high '' This is absolutely false. I do not appreciate getting a letter accusing me of false activity with my credit. A letter stating the facts would have been acceptable and I could have proceeded from there. I can not, however, accept the fact they are sending me a form/custom letter with false information. 

Nobody ever tried to reach me, other than this email that I was n't notified that I would receive. The key factors that you say adversely affected my credit score of XXXX are in absolutely false.

I was denied a credit card by Capital One Venture Card after they nicked my credit twice because they said, via telephone, that the credit reporting bureaus did not have my telephone number.

Once to verify my credit and the second was unnecessary and I want it removed from my credit report because all it will do is hurt my credit report. 

It appears that Capital One Venture Card sent me a form letter of denial stating the above false information. I want the denial of credit by Capital One Venture Card to be removed from any credit reporting bureau because of their false accusations. I DO want a letter from Capital One Venture Card stating the reason I was denied, because as they told me they were unable to get my phone number from the credit bureaus.

This was never disclosed to me in any form or fashion. Other companies are able to specify which type of line the payment should go to "" Specify where my payments are applied '' for example, but this company does not. Furthermore, I was given the wrong date to pay that promotional amount off, which has adversely caused me to be very stressed as I intended to pay it off when it was due and not earlier, they said a date earlier. I called again and got another date so now I really do n't know when it is due. I called to ask for my balance transfer consumer agreement and they advised that they could not give me that either. I asked where the general terms are, and they could not provide that. It is not in the best interest of the customer to apply a monthly payment to the line of credit with the lowest interest or to a promotion amount before applying it to an amount with the highest interest rate. That also happened without my consent. Their terms for "" How my payment is applied '' state that "" Generally, they apply it in a certain form or fashion, I as a consumer need to understand what "" generally '' means, and how I can be satisfied by being able to make a payment to a promotional offer in its entirety without having to pay also purchases that were made afterwards that have no end date for incurring interest.

Again my payment was on time as usual, but their system did not work correctly even after selecting minimum amount due and closing the site. This is unfair and not the way to treat a customer in good standing of 9 years. I want this removed immediately.

Capital One,"I opened a secured credit card with Capital One which required an initial deposit of {$49.00}. Several months have now passed, and I have established credit with them ( my credit line was increased to {$500.00} on the secured card and I was since approved for a second Capital One card with a newly-increased credit limit of {$3000.00} ). I contacted Capital One today to find out about getting my deposit of {$49.00} refunded on the secured credit card. They said the only way to get it refunded is to CLOSE the account! Here is the link where people sign up and it clearly says your deposit is REFUNDABLE based upon credit worthiness. I 've clearly proven my credit worthiness, as they have increased my credit line on XXXX separate accounts substantially. I was told today by a Supervisor at Capital One that the only way to get the initial {$49.00} deposit refunded is to CLOSE THE ACCOUNT. Nowhere in the application process/selling of this product does it say you 'd have to close the account to get the deposit back. Here 's the link to the website where it clearly advertises that your deposit is REFUNDABLE : XXXX Here 's what it says : "" Security Deposit and Credit Line {$49.00}, {$99.00} or {$200.00} refundable minimum security deposit, based on creditworthiness. Minimum required security deposit gets you a {$200.00} initial line. Deposit more than the minimum required security deposit before your account opens to get a higher initial credit line, up to {$3000.00}. '' I believe Capital One 's failure to clearly disclose this requirement of requiring a person to close the account ( honestly, why in the world would we? ) to get the deposit back is fraudulent. I would like to receive a refund of my {$49.00} deposit WITHOUT closing the account, and I would like disciplinary action to be taken against Capital One for this clearly fraudulent act.

Capital One,"Approximately twelve years ago my mother added me as an authorized user on her Kohl 's credit card account so I could start building a positive credit history. I remained on her account for approximately two years. During that time I actively and responsibly used my Kohl 's credit card ( I never missed a payment or accrued interest during that time due to paying the amounts owed in full each month ). XX/XX/XXXX my mother called the Kohl 's credit card department with the intention of simply verifying that I was no longer associated with her account, as I stopped being an authorized user approximately ten years ago. There was a miscommunication between my mother and the customer service staff person that resulted in the staff person thinking I was never an authorized user on the account and taking action to make sure a letter would be sent to clear any and all credit history I had through Kohl 's. That letter was sent to the XXXX credit reporting agencies and my complete credit history through Kohl 's was deleted. This action was not what my mother intended and the letter that was sent was done so based on inaccurate information, as I did indeed have a credit card through Kohl 's. Prior to the letter being sent, the information on my credit report was accurate. After the letter was sent, however, my credit report changed drastically in a negative way and it no longer reflects accurate information. Specifically as a result of the letter, the Kohl 's credit card is no longer listed as one of my closed accounts and does not appear anywhere on the report. Additionally, my first line of credit has decreased from beginning 12 years ago to 9 years ago ( the Kohl 's credit card was my first line of credit ). And finally, my credit score decreased XXXX points as a result. A supervisor in the Kohl 's credit card department agreed to work on providing me with all the information pertaining to my time as an authorized user on the account and contacting the XXXX credit reporting agencies to inform them that the letter was mistakenly mailed to them and my information needs to be returned to the previous ( correct ) status. I received a voicemail several days ago from the supervisor stating that a letter was mailed to my mother 's house with the dates I was an authorized user on the account and that he was still working on having that information provided to the XXXX credit reporting agencies. I was very pleased with this information because I assumed the correct account information was located and that my credit report information would be corrected. I then received the letter and immediately saw that the dates on the letter are inaccurate. The letter states that I was added as an authorized user on my mother 's account on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and then removed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Due to this information not being correct, I do not want it to be provided to the XXXX credit reporting agencies. I am looking for Kohl 's to contact the XXXX credit reporting agencies to explain that they mistakenly mailed the letter requesting my Kohl 's tradeline be removed and to explain that the information prior to the letter being sent was accurate so that my credit report can return to its previous ( correct ) status. At the very least, I do not want Kohl 's to once again mail an inaccurate letter to the XXXX credit reporting agencies, as by doing this they will harm my credit report even further. Since this situation is causing me such extreme distress, I would like to express my concern regarding Kohl 's practices, which go beyond negligence ; first, a staff person mailed an inaccurate, detrimental letter to the XXXX credit reporting agencies without my knowledge and without checking records to verify whether the information was correct and now they are providing false information about the time during which I was an authorized user.

Capital One,"I had opened Spark Business Credit Card by Capital One Bank on XXXX/XXXX/16 and had limit of $ XXXX due to excellent credit and done transactions total of {$120000.00} on this credit card. The problem was that our business checking a/c at XXXX XXXX XXXX had ACH Filter to stop ACH transactions which are not part of "" allow '' list to stop fraudulent transactions. 

Hence, the payments we initiated through web portal of Capital One got denied to our checking a/c due to ACH Filter. In order for XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank to add ACH Originators to "" allow list '', they needed originator 's ACH Company ID number. I contacted the customer service of Capital One to get their ACH Company ID number but they were not aware of what this was and why it was required. Due to difficulty we encountered with Capital One, we decide to initiated the payment to our checking a/c held at XXXX XXXX and hopefully we shall finally get that ID from XXXX XXXX when XXXX XXXX rejects that ACH. The payments we initiated through web portal of Capital One got denied to the business checking a/c due to ACH Filter that account. 

Few days later due to unsuccessful attempts to get Capital One 's ACH Company ID, we decided to use our money market a/c with XXXX XXXX that had no ACH Filter and all payments were cleared successfully at every attempt to this money market a/c with XXXX XXXX. 

Also customer service of Capital One did conference call with XXXX XXXX XXXX three times to verify the funds and validity of account. 

Last week on XXXX/XXXX/16, Capital One bank decided to close the account stating fraud fraud suspension and saying the accumulated cash rewards {$2300.00} automatically get forfeited. 100 % of the outstanding amounts was paid in full before due date. 

Capital One bank is not fair by denying to pay us the accumulated cash rewards of {$2300.00} despite they charged merchant fees to vendor whom i purchased the goods from. 

If Capital bank is not willing to reinstall/active my credit card, then in all fairness they should : a. Mail me check of {$2300.00} cash rewards as they earned full fees from the merchants that i purchased goods/services and they got paid by me in full before all the due dates.. b. Ensure that my credit rating is not affected in any manner I must have talked to Capital for 4-5 hours on 7-9 calls ( including XXXX supervisors ) since we encounterd the 1st problem. Also was surprised to come to know during one of the conversation with their supervisor that the XXXX conference calls which we did with XXXX XXXX to verify funds were not on record with Capital One despite they ( Capital One ) made immediate credit available!!

Capital One,"I was approved for a capital one credit card XX/XX/XXXX. As soon as I received the card, I paid a few medical bills off with it and not even 2 days later, Capital One decided to close the card. They were not willing to open the account back up and I 'm unsure as to why the card was even closed. I asked them what my balance was so I could pay the card off since I was not able to use it anymore and they told me I had no balance. I explained that I had used the card for a few of my medical bills and they continued to tell me there was no balance. I waited a few days then called the back to make a payment and they contined to tell me there was no balance that needed to be paid. I did this several times and eventually gave up because they continued to tell me there was no balance. Suddenly XX/XX/XXXX, I received the first statement ever and it was in red stating I was 120 days past due and the card needed to be paid immediately. Of course I called and made the payment in full and asked why I had never received a statement before and why there was no balance the multiple times I tried calling to pay. Also the balance was paid in full then and still on my credit report they are showing a {$2.00} balance as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Why approve me for a credit card if your going to close it 2 days later? Then tell me there is no balance and I know there was and not take my payment.

I finally payed both my cards off I full and they told me my account was restricted and they could unrestrict it for me but I had to wait a couple days, ok fine. I fell into harder times this time around and they went again another 120 days past due, but I thank God I found a stable good job and I made my minimum payments to keep my account from going into collectionsome, so I two days ago payed them both completely off and now they are telling me my account is restricted and they ca n't do anything about it and I will have to reapply again. 1. That does not make any sense because why would I really want to read run my credit again and if I do n't get accepted and then what and it hits my score. 2. Why would they even restrict my account without notice and without my consent, I am still paying my money to them, and I do want to stay with capital one, but I called and they told me there is nothing they can do on reopening my accounts because they went pass due. I just do n't understand why they do this to you and make it harder on me now and I payed it in full hoping I can reopen my account. This is crazy, time consuming, and stressful.

Capital One,"I had a Capital One credit card, ending in XXXX, with an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX, show up on my credit report as being delinquent due to a purchase at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for around {$25.00}, total due showing as {$89.00} due to late fees and interest charges. 

After seeing this information on my credit report, and that it had dropped by credit score by nearly XXXX points, I contacted Capital One to discuss the matter. I told them that I had not used the card in close to 8 years and that the card had expired on XX/XX/XXXX. They were also able to confirm this. I also had never renewed the card when it expired on XX/XX/XXXX. Certainly the account would have been automatically closed within nearly a 4 year timespan of the card expiring as well. 

Not only did I not make any purchases with the Capital One card for nearly 8 years, on the date of the transaction, I was in the hospital with my with my wife and XXXX daughter who was born at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Capital One advised me that it was an actual credit card swipe on location at a XXXX XXXX store. While I can imagine a credit card purchase being done online using an expired credit card, the expiration date is coded into the magnetic strip which would not process at any modern POS credit card processor. 

I was prompted to look at my credit report due to the fact that I was denied a credit card that I had recently applied for. This never happens as I have an excellent credit score. This is when I noticed that Capital One was reporting this card as delinquent. 

Capital One should never have authorized any transaction on an expired account/credit card. Not only did they allow the transaction to process, but it was done so fraudulently. As a result, they reported inaccurate information to the credit bureaus which has directly affected my ability to obtain credit. 

Capital One did not directly address the issue of why the transaction was allowed to occur, but they did state that they will send me out a fraud application to fill out and I will receive notice of their pending investigation. 

I believe that the fraud application is a moot issue due to the fact that the credit card transaction should not have been allowed to occur in the first place, however, I will fill it out and return it per their instructions. 

The credit card I was denied because of the derogatory remark from Capital One was having a promotion that if you signed up for the card, you would get {$100.00} credit on the issuer 's website. I am seeking {$100.00} in compensation.

Despite my efforts of sending the proof of payments with tracer numbers they requested, via fax, email, mail and a XXXX conversation between XXXX Bank, Capital One and myself ; Capital One either claims they never received my proof of payments or the information is n't sufficient. Through all of the conversations I have had with a Capital One representatives, aside from Capital One claiming the never received the proof of payments, or the information they did receive was n't good enough, I have been told either my payments have posted to an "" unclaimed payment account '', or my payments have been sent to XXXX Bank, or they were unable to trace my payments because the payments were even dollar amounts. I have spent numerous hours on this matter and always end up with nothing being resolved, it is having an impact on my credit report and purchasing a house. It is clear and simple I have made these XXXX payments, I have printed proof with tracer numbers from XXXX Bank and verbal proof from XXXX Bank that in fact Capital One negotiated all XXXX of these payments. I am not sure what else to do, please help or advise me what I can do. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, I sent a payment through XXXX Bank bill pay each in different amounts, later to see on my Capital One statement they did not receive the payment. I called Capital One and they credited my acct in the amount of the payment as a courtesy, until I sent proof from my XXXX bank acct the payment had been sent and cleared my XXXX account. Each month Capital One claimed the information I sent as proof was n't good enough, or they did n't receive the proof of payments or they gave me the run around with what might have happened to my payments. For each payment they claimed they did n't receive I sent the exact proof they requested. This remained a revolving unsettled issue, so In XXXX XXXX, I called Capital One to get the payoff amount ( minus the disputed payments I had already paid and sent proof of payment ) I paid the payoff amount that was given to me by the Capital One representative and I closed my account. 

Just as recently as today ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) I called Capital One to see the status of the most recent information I uploaded and emailed via the link Capital One provided to me. I was told by XXXX XXXX Account Supervisor, in the payment investigations department, that the proof of payment received for the XXXX XXXX, XXXX payment was able to be traced with the information I provided, but the other payments were not able to be traced. This does not make any sense considering the proof of payments I sent contained all the same information as the XXXX XXXX XXXX proof of payment. After she told me this newest information I questioned why the other payments could not be traced, she put me on hold for over 25 minutes and then I was disconnected by fault of Capital One. 

Please advise me on what to do next to resolve this issue.

Capital One,"I was told by Capital One in an email I was receiving new cards with no explanation. I checked my cards, they were not expired. I called n was told the new cards have a chip in them for tracking. I said I 'm upset that we are n't being informed in the email the reason is there will be a chip in the card. I spoke to supervisor who at first gave nonsense excuses - "" they have XXXX people to inform ''. Them said it 's federally mandated we all have a chip on our cards. I said will you ever inform people it 's in their card? He said it will be in the terms n conditions when u get the new cards. That is in the small writing that no one reads after they first get cards! So now if the government has access to the chip mechanism they can track us anywhere we are n't if the chip allows it n so can Cap One n any other entity they give access to without anyone ever being basically informed that we have a chip on our cards. After the NSA phone tracking i consider this a next step and that we are n't not being ethically informed it 's in our card is reprehensible n unconscionable. I also blame the government for federally mandating it.

3. ) When I 've paid off my card in the past they will frequently try to tack on an extra charge unless I call and complain or send an email. 

No, I can not offer any proof ( statements, etc. ), but I think the cfpb should be aware that Capital One is only playing by the rules when challenged. I do n't use my credit card very often and this is the reason why. Capital One is not, not, not trustworthy. 

Thank you.

Capital One,"I had a Capitol One credit card that I opened in XXXX. In late XXXX, I lost my job. My credit card was maxed out and I could n't make payments on it. I spoke with Capitol One and a collections company representing them, and we came to a settlement. The account would be closed and I would make a payment of {$50.00} a month toward the balance of the charged off amount. I have held up my end of the agreement every single month. The payment was not late one time, as it was taken out automatically every single month. When I checked my credit report in XXXX of XXXX I noticed that not only was the account reporting as open, it was showing that I had XXXX ( roughly- at that time ) late payments at XXXX days. I was shocked. The account was only open for XXXX months and I only had XXXX late payments, so how could I have that many late payments? It was both impossible and inaccurate. I had called, written, and disputed several times. I called all three credit bureaus and capitol one every single month since I noticed this in XXXX of XXXX. Each and every time I was told that this is correct. If anyone would take just 5 minutes, they would see it is not possible for this to be correct. I just do not know what to do at this point, as no one at Capitol OneXXXX is willing to help me. Please just take some time to review the information provided and help me adjust the information to be correct. It should state XXXX late payments ( as shown ) and not XXXX as displayed on my credit report. I sincerely appreciate all of your time and assistance. It not only means so very much to me, but it improves my life and living situation. 
Thank you again.

Capital One,"I have XXXX credit cards with Capital One Bank. They say they have a fraud protection department but I have been fraudulently charged at least XXXX and never contacted by them. The XXXX incident occurred XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX of my cards was charged about XXXX times by someone who charged between {$50.00} and {$150.00} each time over a XXXX period using several foreign banks. Just by chance, I discovered the charges and took the information to my local Capital One Bank branch. They agreed that fraud had occurred and immediately contacted their main office. Granted, over the course of time most of my money was returned but why was I never contacted by the Capital One Fraud Department? And more importantly why was I never put on a watch list at Capital One as a client where fraud has previously occurred ; had this been done perhaps the XXXX/XXXX incident would never have occurred. In this day and age such a list is important, as an example Homeland Security just yesterday informed me that my personal information had once again been compromised. I regard the Capital One Bank Fraud Department as a terrible service! 

The next time occurred XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX ( XXXX ), a company that specializes in fraud charged to XXXX of my credit cards. When first contacted by XXXX I was looking for some training plus they knew I had made some recent investments. In retrospect I should have asked where they found out I had made an investment but it has been reported on TV news that banks such as Capital One make lots of money selling this information. At any rate I agreed to the training which had been tailored to my needs. The XXXX salesman said he had sent me by e-mail ( he already had this info ) a copy of the training service that we had just discussed and asked me to sign it. Under the pressure of him still on the line "" my bad '' is signed his e-mail. Later I found out that the email had very little to do with training but was a contract where XXXX promised nothing but a QC Code and a Virtual Platform both available for FREE on the internet. So I agree I was scammed by that XXXX move but surprised by the reaction of Capital One Bank. 

When I agreed to the Training from XXXX I used XXXX of my Capital One credit cards but it had limited funds. I informed XXXX of this fact and explained that only {$1400.00} could be charged at this time and since this agreement was only for training that when this amount had been used up that perhaps I would have additional funds for use to complete the training. After the fact, I later discovered that XXXX had again contacted Capitol One Bank and they agreed to allow an additional charge that overran that card by {$1100.00}. When I contacted XXXX XXXX, assigned by Capital One to operate on their behalf, she informed me by letter that "" even if there is not enough available credit on a credit card that Capital One may honor transactions above the credit limit! '' She also stated that "" Capital One complies with all Federal Guide Lines '' and that these guidelines are "" fair to both the card member and the merchant! '' Since Capital One make a lot of money by charging the cardholder for overcharges this to me is clearly a "" conflict of interest '' and totally not fair to cardholder. Never did I give either IR nor Capital One the right to make this XXXX charge, I have asked XXXX to provide me a document signed by me allowing Capital One without impunity to make such charges and so far has refused this request. 

I have also contacted the XXXX ( XXXX ) about this matter and of course they protect their subscriber. The XXXX advertises that they "" inform the consumer about the practices of their members. '' The problem here is that they charge companies to be a member of the XXXX and do n't want to loose paying members. This is a complete "" conflict of interest! '

Capital One,"I am writing you as a last resort to attempt to settle a debt with your company.  Over fifteen years ago I received XXXX preapproved business credit cards XXXX  I was under the impression at the time that these cards were business cards and that the business was responsible for paying the accounts.  We maintained the accounts for 15 years, even during the lean recession years when our operating credit line was yanked out from under us from BBVACompass.  The business was forced to liquidate, but we continued to pay our accounts.  

In XX/XX/2013, my mother was XXXX and I immediately began to care for my mother XXXX  At the same time I was attempting to XXXX prepare XXXX tax returns, manage my home finances and my mother's finances.  It was also during this vulnerable time that XXXX employees took advantage of the fact I was frequently out of the office and embezzled XXXX from the company.  They were subsequently charged and we are still awaiting trial two years later.  

I left XXXX the company XXXX when the cards were issued, in XX/XX/2013.  Due to the theft, the business was forced to contract and could no longer afford my salary.  I have since learned that XXXX did not take care of the debt and I have been sued by an attorney in XXXX Alabama.  While I am currently employed XXXX, my salary has been cut severely and my savings depleted as I had to care for my mother until she died in XX/XX/2013  

The attorney that Capital One assignment the business account to has sued me personally for the debt of XXXX plus and indicates that it is a means to put pressure on me to pay the debt since the company is no insolvent.  Their exact words ""if you don't lose your job, pay the bill and avoid the garnishment."""
Capital One,"Capital One appears to not provide on its credit card statements the amount of a transaction in foreign currency for transactions done outside the United States. I would like to know if they are legally required to provide this information as well as the exchange rate used and if not I would like to suggest that the CFPB issue regulations to make this a requirement. I would like this transparency to ensure accurate processing of such transactions. I do n't have a specific complaint about any particular transaction at this time.

Capital One,"My husband and I are buying a home and the lender indicated to us that a dispute came up on my credit report with a credit card company. I the credit card company and they said that they did have a record that showed there was a dispute many years ago, but that it was from so long ago they could n't give me any information other than it had since been resolved. The rep I spoke with said that they would contact the XXXX bredit bureaus that they work with to ask that the dispute be removed from my report. The rep said it could take up to 90 days to resolve, which is not a timely fashion when purchasing a home. Given that the dispute was so long ago it is strange that this was never done before- I certainly did n't know it was my responsibility to make that request. I thought after I had paid the card off and closed the account it was over. ( I knew my score could be affected for up to 6 years, but it has been over that period of time and I never followed up. ) I think it is important for consumers to make sure they follow up because it is evident the system of reporting/resolving is not efficient or necessarily accurate. 
"
Capital One,"I have had a Capital One credit card for years. The rate on my card was at 12 %, about the time the credit melt down happen Capital One increased my interest rate to 17 %. I was XXXX day late in making my payment, but feel the rate increase was excessive. My balance on my card is about {$18000.00} so this rate of 17 % makes it very hard for me to pay down. I have always made more than the minimum payments required but still do not see any relief. Please advise. 
"
Capital One,"I applied for a credit card on XX/XX/XXXX and was declined. I received a email notice that the letter explaining why the card was declined was available through a secure link. After logging in to view the letter, it only brought up a letter from XX/XX/XXXX. This was the XXXX time this incident happened. I called to find out why I could not see the letter, only to be told they did not know. I was told I would receive a letter in the mail and have not received it. I applied again on XX/XX/XXXX and was declined and receive the same email again with the secure link on XXXX XXXX, only again to only show an old decline letter from XX/XX/XXXX. I verified my address and was told a letter would be mailed. I have not received any decline letters for the last XXXX attempts starting in XXXX. I would like to know why I am decline so I what I need to do to better my credit status, but Capital One refuses to send me a decline letter via mail, and the onle secure portal does not show my letter. The supervisors only tell me that they will send out the letter again. I need help. Someone please help me get the decline letters from Capital one so I can know why I am declined. The Application or Reference number to the XXXX application is XXXX. I need help. 
"
Capital One,"This is the XXXX time I have filed a complaint against Capitol One over the same issue. Fraudulent charges appeared on my credit card. Capitol One did an investigation and ruled in my favor. I have attached a letter from Capitol One saying the investigation was ruled in my favor. I have attached a copy of that letter from Capitol One. Yet they refuse to make the correction on my credit file when I filed a dispute. They insist on keeping this account listed as a charge off on my credit file when I did not make those charges. 
"
Capital One,"I made a payment of {$1500.00} over the phone to my Capital One credit card using a debit card as a form of payment on XXXX/XXXX/15. The payment cleared the debit card on XXXX/XXXX/15. However it never appeared on my Capital One credit card. I called several times about this issue and it 's still not resolved. Sometimes I had to be on hold for XXXX hours (!!! ) Finally they told me that they sent me a letter asking for the routing number and account number of the bank where I would like to get refund. However, I never got this letter. I called again and they took this information from me over the phone. Anyway, it has been more than XXXX weeks and it seems like Capital One is not going to refund my payment. 
Please see a debit card statement with cleared payment attached. 
My other complaint is that Capital One closed this card about a month ago stating that they did n't like the way I use it. I only did few purchases online for about {$2500.00} total and my card was closed. I have not violated any rules and I really do n't understand why they closed it. I used to have another card from them previously which I rarely used and it was also closed for no reason. If they do n't want people to do certain type of purchases - they should inform customers first about that instead of closing cards. 
"
Capital One,"I am really wondering what is going on and/or not happening? 
By this to simply state, is there any reason credit card solicitors need to shove scout companies at me and probably any other citizens? These evidence in question is merely the demand to place exceedingly high interest rates on our citizens, mainly at young folks and those who are so down and out. 
It seems as though the clause is to be of "" a hand of aid '' or to word pre approved of which in testing that water it is not pre approved at all. 
Now to look the fullness of request, what is thee protection against over taxing? 
Therefore, espionage in these credit companies need to be slapped in thier power and greedy faces. 
How dare these credit card folks angle in this country to prey apon the needs of our youth. 
How dare these credit card folks go after our veterans. 
How dare these credit card folks call their conduct a freedom to do what ever they want plus change the rules. To benefit themselves. 
How many of these credit card folks are unionized to call it "" keeping it in the family ''. 
All terms that do not lay out in fair business practices and respects our Americam Values should be in question. 
Most of all, women attacking other women. Labeling of citizens without definite causes as in calling people forgetful, stupid, and incapable. Disrespect of our older citizens. No regards for life. 
Now do you see the full problems. 
How can anyone just snoop as another angle to attack a citizen? 
Who runs these credit card companies? I have heard some acceptable phrases on groups of creditors as being shroud, determined, and effective when this is all a form of AGRESSORS OF POWER. 

So, again why does it need to be complains about when espionage is obvious. You need to get on the real issues at hand. If not then you are apart of espionage and power channeling out of greed yourselves. 
AMERICA 's debt is interest groups accomplished gains. Not American at all. 
I have all ready told XXXX creditors they need to fix thier problems not attack thier customers. How difficult is it not to bring minds together who are exposed to the effects of debt and gain insights for solutions? 
What causes debt is not always over spending either. Who does not grasp that XXXX. 
It also is the lack of life in all people. It amazes me that after a full days work for a paycheck folks go home and lay around. No sense of being involved in how to save money at all. So I am not trying to be over stating the fullness of debt problems but start finding ways to communicate to adults that life is not all partying this town I reside in has absolutely no drive for life other than pay someone to do the work outside their work place. Because we only work for a paycheck and This is foreign mindset big time. 
Punishing people like they are children is not appropriate either. Creditors do not see slander in what this credit rating scoring really does. XXXX sees ID theft I see defamation of character to place on what is not happening. Stacking on high interest rates as a punishment is senseless all around. XXXX. 
I will be sending this compliant to the Governor of Wisconsin who is and has been bombarded with many unaddressed concerns, Thank you

Capital One,"Capital One sent me an email telling me they had unenrolled me from paperless statements when I missed a payment. A couple of days later, they sent me an email stating "" Thanks for enrolling in paperless statements. '' I did not re-enroll in paperless statements. Enrollment in paperless statements requires consent for purposes of XXXX, which I did not provide. Accordingly, Capital One is violating XXXX by enrolling me without my consent. Further, TILA does not permit creditors to condition delivery of periodic statements on paperless enrollment. As such, failure to send a paper statement in the absence of XXXX consent constitutes a violation of TILA 's periodic statement rules. I believe this issue is not unique to my account, and it is likely that many consumers were enrolled in paperless without their consent and have not been receiving statements properly.

I realize that the credit card companies have been fighting the move to chip cards for years, but you finally started issuing them.

Capital One,"Capital One discontinued my benefit of a Year End Statement Summary associated with my MasterCard, without giving written notice or informing me of the option to opt out of this change by cancelling the card 45 days before the change went in to effect. While attempting to resolve the issue with Capital One I was informed that the Year End Statement Summary would only be provided upon request, and when this service was requested by me, I was informed that it had been discontinued. This is a significant change in my and others opportunity to benefit from the use of this service.

Capital One,"I had a fraudulent {$250.00} charge applied to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The name on the transaction was XXXX. I disputed the charge with Capital One and they agreed to investigate. As of today I have not received any update on the dispute and it has been over 6 months. When I call or email Capital One about when I can expect a {$250.00} credit for the fraudulent charge I get no answers. I wanted to close this account XX/XX/XXXX but Capital One said that since a charge is in dispute I would not be able to close the account.

Capital One,"On or around XXXX XXXX, 2015, I applied for the Capital One credit card directly through their website ( www.capitalone.com ). I carefully read through the disclosures and compared each card 's fees and APR rates before making a selection. I chose the "" Capital One Platinum card '', because it was being marketed as "" annual percentage rate 0 % ( APR ) for purchases for the first year and no annual fee ''. I was immediately approved for a {$3000.00} credit limit. On or about XXXX XXXX, I used the card to pay my rent of {$800.00}. On XXXX XXXX I paid {$150.00} toward the balance prior to the cycle ending. On or about XXXX XXXX, I called to make a payment with customer service again, but was told my payment was not due until the XXXX of each month with a min of {$25.00} due and to wait until the next billing cycle. On or about XXXX XXXX, I called customer services to make a payment and the automated system reported I owed over {$800.00} on the account with a min of {$73.00} due. I immediately spoke with a live customer service rep who reviewed the account. She reported I had a late fee, and interest on the account that has occurred from the last two months. I asked for an explanation since I applied and was approved for the 0 % APR. The representative reported "" I see you did apply for the 0 % APR, but was denied ''. I asked why I had not received a statement and or other forms of verification regarding this and why was I approved for the high credit amount and not the low APR rate? I requested that I speak with a supervisor who can explain why I was not informed of this change and the fees associated with the account. After spending over an hour on the phone, with a reported supervisor he reported "" Capital One ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES & TERMS AND CONDITIONS clearly state why I was denied ''. I asked him to guide me to the exact paragraph to which he was reading from online. The supervisor outlined "" With respect to this offer, I acknowledge that : Even if I am otherwise eligible for this offer, approval is based upon satisfying Capital One 's credit standards ''. I questioned what exactly the Capital One 's credit standards was and how it is used to define my creditworthiness? The supervisor easily became irritated with my request and threaten to discontinue the call and then hung up on me. I called back several minutes later with hope of someone defining the Capital One 's credit standards. I reached another representative who was eager to find out what it meant as well. He could only confirmed that the Capital One 's credit standards is their internal underwriting policy. I fear that with such policy in place that prevents consumer 's access of making informed decision that Capital One 's credit standards is a deceptive marketing and enrollment credit lending practice. Such practices raise the alarm of unfair billing and discriminatory credit card practice.

They informed me of the fraudulent activity and I requested it be disputed and investigated because I was n't even in the country. I also requested that all correspondence regarding the issue be by email, since I was in the XXXX. They agreed and said they would take care of it and let me know if they needed anything. 
I heard nothing, but again a few months later when my mail came over from the XXXX. I found that they had closed out the dispute and placed the items back on the account and again were reporting me as past due. I had heard nothing from them via email as promised. 
They included copies of a receipt claiming it was my signature. Which of course it is not, since I was n't there and it is clear that whoever signed it started writing another name before forging mine. It is not mine. I reported this again to Cap One and again offered to send anything they wanted to show I live and work in the XXXX. I asked them to pull video from teh store because I think it was the cashier that I had told I was leaving the country, who XXXX have done this. 
They requested that I file a police report. I explained my situation but they insisted. I attempted to file a report on line, but was told I could not do that. I tried speaking to the local and State police who told me I had to be in person to process a police report. 
I contacted Cap One again and explained, they said they would take my contract as proof that I was out of the country, if I would mail or fax it to them this would all be resolved. Which of course is not easy XXXX but I had it done XXXX first by mail, then when they claimed not to have received itXXXX. I have the receipt showing the confirmation and the correct fax number. 
I did n't hear anything and contacted them and they claimed they have n't received my fax and closed the case. Again the balance is months overdue and negatively impacting my FICO all this time. 
I am just completely fed up with trying to work with them. Please help me get this resolved. I am not confident that if I send the doc again that they will actually follow through with getting this matter resolved. What happened to Fraud Protection? They get lots of customers claiming they have this, but when someone perpetrates a fraud against you, they will not work with you. To help them locate me, my DOB is XX/XX/XXXX. There is an existing case and the amount of the activity was around {$300.00} but I beleive they have it up to closer to {$700.00} with fees. I am happy to provide more details if needed. this is either the account numberr or case number XXXX, I also found a note from them indicating the last four of the account is XXXX, so maybe they have shut down the old number.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX Kohl 's sent a letter canceling the card, issued by Capital One, claiming they "" observed activity ... not consistent with our expectations..

I have called Capitol One, and have spent far too long on the phone to communicate/explain that I do not use my account for on line payments or for banking. I have asked for my account to be closed, which, at this point the agent panics, and forwards my call to a fraud management process that makes it impossible to get an answer on where, whom, and how someone was trying to access my account. The agents insist repeatedly that it is me trying to login in with the wrong password, and I repeat over and over again to the several customer reps that I have NOT tried to log in! It is a vicious circle that leaves me feeling helpless, and unable to have control of the security of my finances.

Capital One,"I have a Capital One Credit Card with a limit of {$300.00}. After I lost my job in 2009 it became seriously delinquent. I continued to pay when I could and on a couple of occasions, they made an offer that if I paid the over-limit, they would consider the card current. At some point in time, and continuing after the balance was under the credit limit, they restricted the account. I called and was told that even when the account was paid off, they would not lift the restriction. I made the final payment on XXXX and on XXXX they charged a {$3.00} monthly fee with a XXXX minimum interest. I called and was again told that they would not lift the restriction and that I could keep paying the fee, or close the card. I told them that I felt like I was being blackmailed ( extorted would have been a better word ) because if I close the card it will have a negative impact on my credit rating but I am not willing to pay a "" membership '' fee, and interest on said fee, if there was no value in it for me, such as a {$300.00} credit limit. Further, I was recently approved for a secured card with Capital One so I made the suggestion that they secure this one and keep it open. They "" looked into it '' while I remained on hold and came back and told me there was nothing they could do about it. It sounds like it would have to be illegal for them to charge a fee and not provide a service, i.e. a credit line. They said they would not close the account but I was not allowed to use it. I find this absurd. My XXXX choices, after a long period of trying to recover my credit score, are a ) close the account myself and jeopardize my credit, or b ) pay {$3.00} per month for NOTHING!!!!! Please help. Also, under the "" Have you lost money '' section below, I will either lose the ridiculous non-membership ( extortion ) fee each month, or lose A LOT of money by paying higher interest on the car I will be buying in about 6 months.

Capital One,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I went to make a purchase using my CapitalOne Visa card my purchase was declined. I was shocked and knew that there must 've been some mistake as I had available credit. I 've had this account ending in XXXX since the XX/XX/XXXX and during that time always kept my account current and in good standing. So I immediately called the customer service number on the back of the card and I was informed that my account was restricted and to call another number. Upon calling the number which was given, I was informed that my account was closed do to participation in a legal action that is either past, present or pending and that a letter was sent out about a day or so prior to me calling in. At this point I am consumed with worry and anxiety because I am unaware of any legal action and concerned that my identity had been stolen or maybe someone was trying to sue me and I just have n't received notification. Once I received the letter it stated vaguely "" Principal Owner XXXX s ) have past, present or pending legal action. '' No further information was noted as to what this legal action was nor any reference to where the information was obtained from in order for me to investigate the accuracy of the information. I then reached out to the Executive Office which issued the letter to get further information, I was only met with attitude by a male rep and was told to check my credit report for public records which I did while remaining on the call. All three of my credit reports displayed 0 reports on my public records. Then the representative suggested checking with DOJ or FBI or to hire an attorney because they had accurate information. So I saved up some money and retained as counsel The XXXX Law Group. No information was obtained by the law firm during their research and later an Engagement letter along with a signed Authorization Form by me was sent to CapitalOne around XX/XX/XXXX. With help of an attorney CapitalOne still did not provide further information regarding the legal action and it began to seem that only CapitalOne was privy to this legal action. By now I 'm experiencing XXXX daily. I am now out of money for retaining an attorney and still coming up empty handed ; my two additional accounts with CapitalOne which originated with XXXX were closed for the same reason and yet no record could be found. Then I began to think that even if there was something with the DOJ or the FBI that did n't appear on my public record how could anyone know without obtaining a background check which would require my consent and none was given, as well as, why is this company the only institution with access to this information. Last year, I retained the XXXX XXXX Firm hoping to get more information about this legal action being that this firm worked with credit issues and the previous one was criminal, and still none was given. I am now put in an even deeper financial bind after retaining new counsel to try and clear my name with this company based off a vague and ambiguous accusation. In XXXX of this year I consented to a LiveScan ( finger printing ) in order to receive my registration number for the the California XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and their investigation pulled up 0 findings in my record. I feel as though I am being discriminated against in that my previous address was in XXXX and I have had to endure unnecessary emotional distress and financial hardship at the hand of CapitalOne.

Capital One,"I paid a credit card deposit of {$200.00} for a secured credit card. I closed the account due to the fees assessed to my account during my financial hardship. I received calls regarding my account, during my unemployment period. I was actively seeking employment, and once I found a job I called the company to see I could arrange for a settlement. Once I reached a representative, she stated to pay them off would be a total of {$170.00}, after my initial payment of {$25.00}. After making the payment of {$25.00} I received a statement stating my total balance that was greater than the {$170.00}, I then spoke with a representative earlier this week XXXX/XXXX/15, and was told that there is no settlement agreement on the account, and that to bring the account current I needed to pay, {$230.00}. Which is way more than my deposit, and I was told that my deposit was already used toward my balance, which makes no sense. 
"
Capital One,"I was given a credit card increase twice on my card from {$300.00} to {$500.00} and just recently to {$1700.00}. My account was sold from HSBC card services to Capital One credit card. They have kept the interest rate from HSBC from 19.99 % to 20.79 %. I called on Monday XXXX XXXX, 2015 to ask could they lower the interest rate. The supervisor told me that she could not lower the interest rate because of the Prime that was going on. I explained to her if I am given a credit increase this must indicate that my credit should be good enough to lower the interest rate. When I send in a payment the interest and fees on the card are more than the payment. The minimum payment does not even help to pay down the balance because the interest on the card is so high.

Capital One,"I have an issue with payments being issued to the account properly. On occasions representatives have keyed in incorrect account numbers as well as payment being made to Capital One directly to the branch offices and incorrect credited to the account. During several occasions I have asked for the payment investigation dept and was sent to the incorrect dept 's with rep 's out of my country while I was specifically as for someone in my own country as I have experienced issues with rep 's from outside USA have contributed to alot of these errors. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I was to have a call scheduled to contact the institutions that were the issuer of the payments, XXXX came and passed and no one contacted so approx at XXXX I reached out to the credit card company Capital One only to be placed on an extensive hold with gaining no resolution ; I was sent to foreign countries with hold 's and disconnected. At approx XXXX I reached out to Capital One to try and get someone within the dept ; whom the day prior stated she would note and have a call back at XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 which never happened at XXXX when I reached out to the executive office and spoke with XXXX whom did n't see notes of a scheduled and was very rude thus getting no help from anyone at Capital One to reach out to the branch within their own institutions or the outside bank that was involved, at this time the account remains inactive. Also I not being the primary but retains POA which is noted on the account but at times the reps state they can not find and to make matters more detailed at this time the creditor is requesting documents of the primary such as ID Social Security as well as utility, documents will be provided and I stated to the rep during the last call that documents will be provided but payments will be ceased and none will be continued until resolution is made. Please note that on a separate occasion when there was an issue with the remitting institution and I permitted and allowed a 3-way call with myself validating the account and allowing Capital One fraud department to ask any necessary questions they had.

Capital One,"I initiated a transaction through bill pay and paid Capital One two times. Because of this, I contacted the cc on XXXX and asked that my funds be returned to me. I was told on the initial call that it would take 1-2 business days for the trans to be processed. It is now XXXX and I have spent hours on the phone with this company and my transaction is still not in my account. I was given several time tables throughout the process. According to their files, the transaction to return my funds was completed at XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/15. The bank they are transferring the funds to is XXXX Bank. Historically, all transactions appear on the homepage of my internet banking as pending as soon as they arrive at the bank. I have been on a number of conference calls with Capital One and XXXX Bank to confirm there is no transaction for the refund of {$480.00}. Today I spoke with XXXX ( id # XXXX ) who told me he was the top of the line to speak with on the phone. He was unable to transfer me or give my information to his supervisor to have them contact me. He also told me that my bank needed to contact XXXX which is the XXXX party that processes the ACH, because Capital One has done everything they can do on their end and are now washing their hands of responsibility. They gave me information to FAX an escalation letter for complaint but that it is now XXXX responsibility to make sure that I get the funds transferred into my account. While customer service representatives have attempted to be kind, none of them seem to project any sense of urgency ( with the exception of XXXX, who escalated my refund transaction to be processed in the first place after the maximum number of days XXXX.

We provided XXXX name and the XXXX for our business. 2 years later, after many calls to Capital One and being told repeatedly that they report credit for XXXX as well as the primary cardholders personal account, we were finally advised - truthfully - that SPARK does not report to any business bureaus and only reports credit under the personal SS # of the primary cardholder. Our company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX has just wasted 2 years only to learn that by using the SPARK card we have not built or strengthened XXXX ' credit at all. This is not a business credit card. It is a personal credit card that allows the cardholder to include a business name on the face of the card. If we had been told the truth initially when placing the application, we would not have requested this card. I have personal credit cards. This has caused harm to our business as we now must start over and find another company and because of lack of credit history we are not able to obtain important tradelines for XXXX. Both XXXX and SBA counsel small businesses to establish separate tax ID numbers for businesses in order to establish credit in the business ' name.

Capital One,"Kohl 's unfairly and inaccurately utilizes credit reporting practices. 
After opening an account, I never received a statement. I never received even received the card. 
I made a large in store return which returned back to the card and their in store representative told me the account was a XXXX balance. 
A few months later I check my credit and notice a late charge from Kohl 's. Again, I never received any notification from them. No emails, no statements, nothing that would advise me that there was a balance or a payment due. 

I called to dispute and was told there was a balance and payment past due to which I paid off immediately. 

I asked their rep for their terms and conditions to which she responded, they are not available online, they need to be mailed to each person and they are different for every single customer. 

I continued to dispute the charge sending another email and got a call from bethany at the office of the president. She continued to say that they have no record of statements being returned so they would not remove the mark. 

They do NOT send any notification that they are reporting you. They do not PROPERLY communicate balances owed to their customers. They do NOT express due diligence with their customers to inform them of account status. 

After further review, there are THOUSANDS of other consumers who have had almost identical interactions with Kohl 's and their credit card. 

Kohl 's did NOT notify me that there was a payment due, past due, or balance due. Kohls did NOT notify me that a payment was late and Kohl 's did NOT notify me that they were GOING to report me to the credit bureau and Kohls did NOT notify me they DID report me to the credit bureau. 

Because of the lack of due diligence and lack of communication from Kohl 's in regards to my account and account status, because I called to correct this issue which they did not correct, plus being given improper information from their in store rep and their phone rep, I am asking that Kohl 's remove this improperly reported past due payment from my credit.

I 've never experienced anything like this - they seem anti-customer, accusatory and are unable to articulate any of the reasons any fraud alerts were triggered. Something is fishy with Capital One - I highly recommend avoiding it. We have a legal team now looking at what our options are.

Capital One,"Submitted to Kohls Department store a request to remove XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2014 30-day notices on all three credit reports as they were placed in error. I did a follow up call and spoke to a XXXX-Supervisor who agreed that I Kohls received three payments from me in the same month and probably did not apply them correctly ( one for XX/XX/XXXX, another for XX/XX/XXXX and a third for XX/XX/XXXX ). I believe this was human error as I made the payments for each month. Additionally, I am requesting a credit on my account for two late payments as they were made and payments were inappropriately applied.

Capital One,"Capital One Bank USA has listed XXXX negative remarks on my credit report on XXXX supposedly separate credit cards showing 5 or more missed payments. All XXXX are showing closed from 2011. Capital One Bank USA continue to update this on my report to extend the time to stay on my report. This is a violation under the ( FCRA ) And under the Consumer Protection Act in the State of North Carolina. 

This negative information being reported has caused me to suffer on the condition of thousands of extra dollars in interest on several loans. I have also suffered stress and undue hardship concerning this matter. 

Capital One Bank USA has being sued in the past for such violations under Federal and State Laws, but this does n't seem to prevent them from further violations against Consumers of the United States. Capital One Bank USA pays the Credit Reporting Bureaus to use there reporting servers to violate laws online electronically.

Capital One,"I have been dealing with Capital One Bank for years. Have always paid on time and unfortinutley, have had to use them, after paying them off several times. I have spoken to them about there interest rate and have not been able to get anywhere. There rate on purchases, 15.90 % APR. This interest rate is rediculas and according to there record, on a balance of {$8900.00}, paying the minimum, in XXXX years, you would have paided {$20000.00}, pay off in XXXX years, {$11000.00}. Is there anything that can be done with this high interest rate

Capital One,"Apparently Capital One has amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act. You really need to publish this particular bold infraction. I disputed a Capital One tradeline on my credit file. I received the attached letter from Capital One saying that they would not process my dispute unless I sent them a list of items in the letter. 
Now the FCRA only requires that I send my drivers license and a utility bill along with information from my credit file and the nature of my dispute. They also are mandated by federal law to record the current status of the item or delete it from my file. I sent this dispute on XXXX XXXX. I know the bureaus send the dispute to Cap One through E-Oscar and give them 10 days to respond. But it is now XXXX XXXX and Cap One says that they wo n't even process this dispute unless I MAIL them the items in their letter. How is this possible? There is no way that the bureaus can comply with the 30 day maximum time frame for processing ... so the item will remain on my file because Capital One is breaking federal law and usurping the bureaus administration of my dispute. This has all the ear marks of a huge class action lawsuit. Consumers having their disputes pressed beyond the 30 day time frame because Capital One refuses to comply with section XXXX of the FCRA and the bureaus being wilfully negligent of section XXXX simply because Capital One does not want to respond in their ten day time frame. 
I was told that XXXX XXXX once went to Capital One to discuss consumer disputes and their handling BY Capital One ... and that the XXXX XXXX representative said : "" We want to make our database look just like your data base '' ... .but I never thought that the bureaus would get out of compliance with federal law BECAUSE of Capital One.

Capital One,"I was charged a late fee for paying too early. In XXXX 2015, I made a credit card payment to Capital One. The payment arrived at Capital One on my statement closing date, so instead of applying it to the correct statement, they applied it to the previous statement and declared me past due when the payment due date arrived. I was charged a late fee and had my account suspended even though I paid EARLY! 
"
Capital One,"I was contacted by phone by a company ( which I initially believed to be Capital One calling ) claiming to lower the interest rate on my Capital One card. During the process I was asked to agree to a fee which they explained would take the place of my existing interest charges on the account, however when they were unable to negotiate with Capital One and I realized they were not actually my credit card service I requested to cancel my transaction. The man on the phone became very hostile and threatened me with collections on the amount k had agreed to pay before. I asked to speak to a manager and demanded that everything be cancelled because I was no longer interested. I was then told that the previous man I had been speaking too would process my request to cancel and during this process he asked questions that I was uncomfortable answering and when I asked why he needed it he said it was so he could complete the cancelation request. I was then told that I was denied a cancellation but had been approved for a card through XXXX at 0 % interest. I became enraged and told them I did not want a XXXX XXXX and had not been told earlier in the interaction that they would be applying me for another credit card. I was told again that I had no choice and could not cancel the transaction. They then called XXXX and instructed me to tell them I wanted a balance transfer. At this point, believing I had no choice and would be charged anyways I did what they asked and ended the transaction. I did not provide them with my bank routing number as they requested and they said they would call back. Immediately upon ending the phone call I contacted XXXX and told them what happened and they transferred me to the Fraud department who assisted me in cancelling the card and balance transfer. Over the next few days I was called consistantly by a blocked number but did not answer the calls. I then received a message on XXXX that on Friday my bank account would be charged approx {$800.00} for their services and was given a phone number to call the manager back. I called back and spoke to the manager who told me that I had no choice but to pay even though I had cancelled the cards and received no benefit. When I told him that I had tried cancelling at the time because I had not been told previously about having to get a XXXX XXXX and did n't want to continue if that was the process. He basically told me it was n't their fault I did n't understand the process and I had no choice because I had made a verbal contract. He said then that my mandatory payment would be sent to a collection agency and would negatively impact my credit score. I have placed fraud alerts on my accounts but do not want to be negatively affected. I believe I was misled into agreeing to pay for a service when they did not dislose the entire process to me initially. I had even been told verbatum that my credit card number would not chance which I why I did not expect a different credit card account to be created. In addition to this I learned after that legitimate companies will not contact you regarding interest reductions like this and I was involved in a scam.

Capital One,"I recently received a letter stating that I was almost XXXX months behind on payments. I had signed up for online banking with my bank and they were suppose to make the payment on the day I scheduled but that did not happen. I now have 2 late payments on my credit report. I pay all my bills this way so I not sure what the problem is with Capital one.

Capital One,"In XXXX of 2013 I applied for a "" Sony '' card with Capital One after watching the TV show XXXX. I was going to have a XXXX in up coming XXXX and I was going to need a new recliner to assist me in the first month or so of healing. I was grateful for the card and there was no interest for the first year. 
My first several payments were substantial, and they almost immediately raised my credit limit from {$500.00} to {$3500.00} within two or three months of my making payments well over the minimum. 
Now I live on a fixed income and this card was tempting to have because many months I have to resort to using the food bank just to have enough to eat each month, so I used the card, and I used it often. Now my balance is over {$3000.00}, but I have managed, with the help of taking in a boarder to increase my income and therefore continue to make hefty payments every month. They are XXXX, XXXX and sometimes XXXX times the minimum required. My interest, once it began to kick in is 24.9 %, yet I keep making the big payments. It is hard to get the balance paid down to a reasonable amount because of this hefty interest. I have called XXXX times in the last almost two years, trying to get them to lower the interest rate, but each time they tell me no. They tell me that the interest rate only goes down with "" special offers '', yet in the almost two years I have had this card and been paying huge payments, I have never been offered a lower interest rate. 
This company is raking in XXXX, yet they ca n't lower my interest rate from 24.9 %? I am on social security and only earn $ XXXX month. In the winter, when my heating bill rises to over {$200.00}, my average cost of living per month goes from just over {$770.00} to well over {$920.00} and that leaves very little for gas and groceries. I also receive food stamps, but for some reason, I only qualify for {$15.00} in assistance, so that is not of much help at all. 
Why wo n't this company reduce my interest rate? I have proven that I can make adequate payments, even on my limited income, yet they refuse to decrease their profit margin made on the back of some poor XXXX retired XXXX. I think it sucks ... ..but it sure seems to reflect the greed and avarice that permeates the climate of this country as of late. 
It will take me years to pay this off at this enormous interest rate.

Capital One,"I am trying to improve my credit score and opened a {$300.00} credit card account with Capital One.I chose them because they were advertised on XXXX XXXX and they give the cash back option for all purchases. I started using it for everyday cash purchases and using the online function to pay the bill after it would reach a point as long as I had the amount in my checking account. I stayed in touch with Capital One 's call center and had suspicion it was n't in the USA but did n't want to be labeled a XXXX. I travelled out of town to California to visit my little brother who has XXXX. While doing so I made a payment and unbeknownst to me, a family member at home who has access to my personal bank account in case I should die, removed money for their valid use without my knowledge causing my payment to be rejected. When I returned home and found out and before Capital One knew about it, I called to notify them and let them know what I was doing to remedy my balance with Capital One. Shortly there after within a few days, I received a call from some foreign sounding man, telling me my bank had refused to give him my personal banking numbers, including routing, Social Security number, address, etc. etc. He demanded I give it to him, I refused, He got irate and wanted me to email him the info, i refused, he wanted me to XXXX call my bank, I refused and politely asked him to put it in writing on official capital one letterhead. He was n't happy and started threatening that he was going to suspend or restrict my card, to which I said something to the effect of give it your best shot and hung up. My account was restricted and I made numerous ( XXXX ) calls to follow-up and resolve it. I did receive a letter telling me they suspected fraud 10 days later and that I needed to call to resolve the matter. Nothing in writing said I had to provide my personal info in writing to Capital One. I did manage to get on-line and delete my bank info for online paying of my bill. The next day I was restricted from signing into my account. The following day I could sign in. I spoke to someone in the escalation department, again, they wanted that personal info. I said no, that 's not their concern and I was using it according to the rules. i then asked, If they did not release the restrictions to close the account. They atre refusing to close my account until I Provide Them the information. I have paid it down to XXXX and they still will not close my credit card account. I have asked numerous times for the name and address of an executive in the USA that I can write to that will have the authority to close my account and they refuse to give me that. Today I just got done speaking to them and asked to be transferred to a USA call center since I was connected to a XXXX call center, again I was transferred to a "" XXXX '' in XXXX. Again I did not get my account closed. This is not right and I 'm probably not the only XXXX. I suspect fraud on their side at the expense of elderly XXXX Americans. Why ca n't I follow the chain of command with Capital One and even get a name or address of a Company Ececutive that is making these policies and procedures. If it 's not an American Company that requires and has access to such sensitive information any company should have to identify themselves as such immediately right under their logo in the start of the procedure. If it 's not an American company, I would not have given them my business as a foreign country business does n't have to follow the same rules if they do n't want to, but they do get to use are laws against us when it suits them. ( sorry for the opinion, but it 's how I feel ). I request my concerns be addressed all set-up and interest fee 's be returned to me and my account closed with minimal or none affect to my credit rating.

Capital One,"I purchased a round-trip ticket from XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 using a credit card ( card # XXXX ) from Capital One. On the return leg of the trip, XXXX XXXX required me to pay a baggage fee, which I did using a DIFFERENT credit card ( card # XXXX ) from Capital One. The trip was then canceled and XXXX XXXX eventually refunded some of the monies ( about XXXX % of the round-trip ticket ) onto the original card to purchase the ticket. When I tried to get a refund for the baggage fee on the OTHER credit card, they could n't find the purchase in their computer system and nothing was refunded. I then disputed the purchase to Capital One. 

Capital One took my complaint, but then denied my refund since XXXX XXXX said they refunded the baggage fee onto the other card, yet they could n't find the baggage fee on their computer system when I called to ask for a refund? They also denied it because I did n't provide a refund receipt, which I never received from XXXX XXXX. Since XXXX XXXX has that data, should n't they be required to either give it to me in the first place or supply it themselves? I also want to know how an XXXX like XXXX can say they refunded monies to a credit card that was n't even used to pay for the baggage fee originally? Since I used card # XXXX to pay for the baggage fee, how can they say they refunded the baggage fee money to card # XXXX, even if that card was used to purchase the original ticket but not the baggage fee?

We knew nothing about this and was never notified about the lean if we had been we could have paid off the loan earlier. When we called and talked to the lawyer that was handling the loan he said they did n't have to notify anyone, if we had n't sold the building when we did they would still be adding interest to the loan and we would n't have known about it.

Into the conversation and after several questons that she could not pronounce well enough for me to understand she tells me that she ca n't activate my cards because she is not talking to me on the number listed on my account, but she is the one that called me. She tells me I have to send in documentation to prove who I was. I called back on Monday morning and talked to a supervisor and she told me the same thing about sending in documentation. I had the supervisor close the account. I understand their fraud protection guidlines, but they went above and beyond to treat me like a criminal. The strange thing is she trusted me enough from the information I gave her to close the account but, not activate it. I do n't appreciate it and would like for others to be wary of Capitol One.

Capital One,"I had ( XXXX ) XXXX Capital One Credit Cards. XXXX was for business, and the other personal. I had always tried to be timely on payments. I worked late a lot, and at the time their web page stated that payments could be made until XXXX. There were times there I would get home late from work and not submit my payment until close to XXXX. They would then charge me a late fee. I complained several times. They told me payments made after XXXX were late, but still accepted until XXXX. The web page did not say that at all. Then the real problem began. I would get on to make payments and I would get several errors like "" you request did n't go through '' or "" the site is down. '' This would happen frequently. This would then cause the payment to be late. I did not know what to do. I have tried several times to remedy this with them but they continue to claim that I never contacted them. I will attach several letters. Upon request, I have several letters from the Attorney General of Indiana also. I feel that they purposely mislead people on the payment acceptance. This caused me to go into default and now stuck in collections. I went into default because they would charge late fees, cause the limit to go up and then charge over limit fees. There must be a remedy to this before I am forced to obtain a lawyer. This has resulted in MASSIVE interest rates when trying to obtain credit from reputable sources, including countless hours spent researching and fighting this matter.

Capital One,"I applied for a Capital One secured card in 2014, which is advertised as a way to rebuild credit. I was approved with a deposit that I was told that I would get back after showing good usage of the card. I was even told that my card could be upgraded. However, though I 've never been late on a payment, when I attempted to get my deposit back, I was told I had to close the card. Capital One has even increased the credit limit on my card without an additional deposit and without me asking. 
Capital One can not advertise a card as helping to rebuild credit and promising people to get their deposits back when you have to close the card ( hurting your credit ) in order to get your deposit back.

Capital One,"Prior to my divorce, my ex husband was able to open up several accounts online in my name using my information. I have been able to get everything except an account he managed to open in my name with Capital One. After getting nowhere with them, I filed a dispute XXXX. Instead of removing it, I received letters from CO thanking me for my recent inquiries into my account. This is infuriating, as I have not had an account XX/XX/XXXX with them. I have tried to call them, but instead of listening they try to trick me into making a payment- which I am not going to do. This was not my account and I will not be making any payments to it. I knew nothing about this account XX/XX/XXXX, when I had my credit pulled by a mortgage company, hoping to get a home loan. 
I am tired of dealing with this, and I need some help. I worked very hard to close out any account that I had opened in effort to be debt free. While I realize that hurts credit too, I did not want to owe anyone anything. I need help with this.

Capital One,"We are having a problem with Capital One Bank and Menards. We opened a Menards credit card with Capital One to buy kitchen cabinets. The cabinets on display, which we fell in love with, were a higher quality than the exact same cabinets we purchased. The cabinets we received had staple marks on all the finished end units. XXXX cabinet had the toe kick plate missing. Another cabinet had an exposed nail bent over sticking out of it. When we brought it to the managers attention, he said this has never happened before. Yet, he said he would order us new cabinets to replace the damaged cabinets. However, the replacement cabinets would arrive with staple marks showing on all end cabinets. He ordered us skins to put on the end cabinets ; which we had to pay our installer to cut down to size and install. This was not told to us by the salesperson. She obviously wanted a sale so she omitted pertinent information we needed to make an educated decision. We still had issues with the cabinets and called Capital One to let them know what kind of company they were representing. They stopped taking and returning my calls after XXXX told me that Menards would have the cabinet company call me to fix the problem. To this day, they have n't called. I have since received a letter from Capital One stating that Menards did nothing wrong and my account would be removed from disputed status. Menards and Capital One must have one sweetheart deal going. Stick together and stick it to the customer! In my opinion, Capital One is now an accessory to fraud. Menards is refusing to partially reimburse me for all the aggravation and frustration we are going through, not to mention the extra money we had to pay to have our contractor install the corrections. They wo n't even exempt my account the late charges and fees accruing since I refuse to pay until the case is really settled to my satisfaction. I am hoping you can help me. Pictures are attached.

Capital One,"I currently have fico scores of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. My reports show perfect payment history and XXXX old collections, both of which have been paid in full. Repeated attempts to obtain a basic Capital One card have been failures, except the approval for a secured card which I recently closed due to this issue and I do n't need another secured product. General internet searches show that my credit file and scores exceed Capital One underwriting requirements for a basic card. I work with a person, I have seen his credit file multiple times as he has asked me to help him resolves some issues, who has lower scores plus multiple negative accounts, plus XXXX medical collections and a federal tax lien. This is factual information. Based on this and XXXX extending me XXXX in retail credit ( they use the same reports CAP ONE does ) and my credit file profile, I believe Capital One is participating in discriminatory lending. I come to this conclusion because no other rational reason exists for the denial in credit. While I understand I am not specifically entitled to anything, by extending credit to individuals with lower scores and credit profiles, capital has violated my rights as a consumer and FCRA guidelines. Credit Pulls Database shows scores of individuals with credit scores in the high XXXX being approved for a basic Capital One unsecured cards. I can provide documentation to support my claims about my score, credit profile, payment status, credit utilization, etc. I talked with CAP ONE executive resolutions and they said one reason for denial was high balance? number of unpaid balances.

Capital One,"As my issues were never completely resolved with my last submitted complaint approximately 50 days ago, I 'm submitting another. 

My previous CFPB # is XXXXCapital One Case # XXXXAfter about 2 months of fighting with Capital One, they finally gave me credit for the {$13000.00} balance transfer that was done in error the first time, and the second time never arrived. I was happy to hear from XXXX XXXX, in the "" Executive Team '' via telephone. She said to call her if anything else happened, or if I had any further problems. Well, I did try to call her, using the PIN codes she provided over the phone and by letter. I stayed on hold for over 30 minutes and never got a voice on the phone, and called back multiple times that day - never reaching anyone, only listening to music on hold. I received her letter which also went to you, of Capital One 's version of the events - It mentioned nothing of the hell I went through, how extremely unprofessional they were at all times, and how not one supervisor over there helped me for 2 months while they charged me interest on {$13000.00} and then shut down my card for late payment. It does n't mention how they broke the law by not responding to my repeated requests to refund my my interest, and to reverse this charge - the hours I spent on hold, and how badly this hurt me financially. If you want to hear about the events as they actually happened, please contact me. 

I 'm writing today because I had asked XXXX XXXX to do the following for me, in lieu of the mistakes made:1. Reverse the interest that I was charged2. Reduce my payment back to what it should be, as I could not afford to make a {$300.00} payment. 

XXXX said this would be done, and that they would not report my late payment due to their billing error to the credit bureaus. I was given permission to make an {$82.00} payment that reflected my true balance, and that the payment would be adjusted. Well, It 's been a month since I spoke to the "" Exceutive Team '' ie XXXX XXXX. Despite making the {$82.00} payment, my account has been shut down for the better part of a month, it says online that I 'm late, and that I owe a $ 160+ payment - which is not indicitive at all of my balance. And I have no idea if they reported me late to my creditors ( something they agreed not to do, as this is their error entirely ), but can only suppose that they did not honor what we agreed to in our conversation, as so many things continue to handled improperly. Though I appreciate what XXXX XXXX tried to do, I think, I still was given a number for her that proved to not get through to her, after many attempts, so this was not helpful. And after having called them hundreds of times to straighten this out, I can not keep doing so and expect a different result. I need my good credit in tact as much as you do, and if it 's not, this hurts me. I run a business and have affairs to manage - so I protect my credit carefully. I 've made all of my agreed obligations to Capital One, but this is just abuse. Not even after I reached the highest level possible did this issue get resolved, and I 'm in a much worse position now, from both a credit staindpoint and an overall financial standpoint. I 'm in complete disbelief.

I was told that I was being charged the extra fees for a cash advance. I told the rep that the info was incorrect and that I had never had a cash advance. They transferred me to a supervisor for better assistance. The supervisor told me that when I used the money transfer its considered a cash advance. I told her I never received any cash to me. At this time I was still trying to process the info and research to see if that information was correct. I started looking at my agreement with Capital One, and there explanation of fees. I could n't find anything that states that a online money transfer service is considered a cash advance. What I did find on there website that say 's understanding credit card terms. "" A cash advance is not a regular credit card charge. A cash advance allows you to withdraw cash from an ATM, bank or by using checks given to you by the issuer for use when paying with your card is not an option.

This is far more economically sound than using a credit card cash advance '' After finding several sources that explained this I quickly called back the supervisor and ask them to remove these charges. She declined with no explanation. I asked her to provide me where I can find on our agreement or on there website that justifies theses charges. She could not provide. I told her of my findings and explained that I purchased a service and that no cash was given to me.

Capital One,"I am writing in regards to Capital One Platinum credit card. I received an offer for a new Platinum credit card in the mail about a year ago.

After calling Capital One I was informed that they do not allow consumers to make payments in advance. 

How is it legal for Capital One to not allow me to pay in advance. I pay my car loan payment 3 months and I pay all of my other credit cards 1-2 months in advance.

This is why I am filing a complaint, because there is a hold on my account and it is totally unnecessary, because despite repeatedly telling them and the notes showing XXXX verified who I am and was supposed to remove the hold, but he did n't who the system failed, they would n't budge.

Capital One,"Identity thieves have obtained sufficient information about me to attempt to open credit card accounts. I have received notice of at least 3 attempts in the past 2 weeks of credit cards being sought in my name ( 1 time at XXXX XXXX XXXX and 2 times at Capital One ). I am concerned that Capital One Bank may not have adequate systems in place to prevent future fraud in my name. When I received the XXXX Capital One credit card I had not requested, I called and got it cancelled. When I got a XXXX letter informing me that another credit card was coming, I called back. I was getting contradictory information from the fraud line representatives - one person found the XXXX application for credit and another could n't. The last representative I spoke with said that they could not associate a fraud warning with my information. This does not appear an adequate solution. Will I keep receiving new credit cards that I have to cancel? I ca n't tell based on Capital One 's current response. I have also filed a police report and filed a fraud warning with the credit bureaus. I just fear that Capital One 's response is not adequate. It is also possible that the XXXX letter I received purportedly from Capital One is a sophisticated phishing attempt - but, based on Capital One 's response, I ca n't tell.

Capital One,"My XXXX 2015 statement contained a charge dated XXXX/XXXX/15 from "" XXXX * XXXX XXXX '' for {$290.00}. I have never purchased anything from this person or website. I disputed the charge as unauthorized. Capital One replied that the merchant substantiated the transaction and they would rebill me. What was provided to substantiate the charge was a printout of the merchant 's website ( which I did not recognize ) and a copy of the charge billed to the wrong expiration date, wrong cvv code, and wrong address. The only accurate piece of information was my card number, which has n't changed since I received the yard many years ago. 

I did research and noticed that this charge was also made by the merchant exactly one year ago. I did n't recognize it then either and the records show I disputed it and it was removed from my bill. 

I responded to Capital One 's rebill by letter indicating that the unauthorized charge was still disputed, that I never made this purchase, never used any product or service from this merchant, and to advise the merchant to stop billing me. I attached documentation of the previous dispute from a year ago. 

Capital One today sent me a letter saying "" your request lacks all of the previously requested information to validate your dispute ''. Please see the attached letter Capital One is referring to. I provided all of the information possible. It is not my responsibility to contact the merchant to beg for a credit for something I never purchased. Capital One claims a {$0.00} fraud liability policy and they have failed to abide by it.

They still have not presented the payment to my bank, it is now a week later. 

It seems clear that they are holding this payment until after XX/XX/XXXX because they hope that my bank account will not be able to cover the payment and that I will then have charges and a higher interest rate to pay. 

Is this a new way the credit card company has found to increase its revenue, Can they be doing this to others as well?

Their own evidence indicated that their are providing false information. Please see their bills that they have attached as a response to a CFPB complaint. They made no mention of the insurance program. They just wanted to be aggressive in collecting due amount instead of notifying me that arrangement can be made through the insurance. 

Thus, again this is part of my proof that Capital One made misrepresentation of material fact by selling me products that supposed to cover credit card payments if I am unemployed or disable. Capital One made monetary restitution. The representatives were more interested in hounding for payment instead of applying the protection benefits.

Capital One,"Good afternoon, I am submitting a complaint on the manner that Capital One managed a charge I dispute on my Credit Card Account. Following is a detail account of the events that transpired : On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I went on-line to find car rental for XXXX during XX/XX/XXXX. I used the XXXX search engine to review the different alternatives and choose XXXX of them. I booked the reservation with XXXX. The reservation total cost was {$370.00}. I prepaid the reservation in full using my XXXX XXXX. 
I received an e-mail confirming the reservation and the rental agreement. The reservation included unlimited mileage, taxes, airport fees, liability and fire insurance. The agreement stated in the terms and condition "" Upfront Pricing, and No Hidden Fees ''. 

Attached for your reference are the following documents : Confirmation and agreement of the reservation Full payment of the reservation with my XXXX XXXX. 

During XXXX 2015, I traveled to XXXX and used the reservation as previously agreed. On XXXX/XXXX/2015, I arrived at the XXXX rental desk to pick up the car. During this process, I gave my Capital One credit card as insurance for any accidental damages. I only signed a document stating that I was retrieving the vehicle in full working condition with no damages. I did not sign for or authorized any additional charges. 

I returned the on XX/XX/XXXX, as previously agreed upon. The car was returned in perfect condition with no damages. On XX/XX/XXXX, I notice that XXXX charged me an additional {$690.00}. I contacted XXXX to inquire about these charges and they told me that they were "" additional fees '' part of the rental agreement. I refused the charges, on the grounds that they were not previously disclosed or agreed by me. I had no luck with them, so I initiated the dispute with Capital One to eliminate these charges. 

I contacted Capital One to dispute these charges on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I provided a full written explanation and copies of the supporting evidence. As part of the investigation process, Capital One received an itemized bill from XXXX detailing the additional charges of {$690.00}. Capital One shared this bill with me. Capital One told me that this bill "" demonstrates '' that the charges are valid and the dispute would be closed in the favor of the Merchant. I immediately contacted them to state that the bill is fraudulent. The bill was not signed or approved by me. Furthermore, the bill was created and produced after the rental agreement was over. None of the additional fees in this new bill proceed either because they were fully prepaid by the reservation or they were not part of the term s and conditions of the original agreement. 

I contacted Capital One in numerous occasions though the phone, fax and e-mail to explain that the addional charges were never authorized by me, are not part of the terms and conditions of the original agreement and therefore do not proceed. Capital One did not gave credit to any of my explanations or supporting document. They only gave credit, to a bill which was fraudulently created after the rental agreement was over. Capital One closed my dispute in favor of the customer on XXXX XXXX, 2015.

Capital One,"XX/XX/XXXX, I was in XXXX XXXX and my wallet got stolen with all my credit cards and debit cards. Whoever stole the cards used my Capital One Venture card at a XXXX and charged {$2200.00}, {$2400.00}, and {$2400.00} all on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. The culprit also spent {$1000.00} on XXXX other cards which was XXXX XXXX and my XXXX XXXX card. I called all XXXX companies the day after ( Saturday XX/XX/XXXX ) immediately after I realized my wallet was gone. All the companies said not to worry and that everything would be taken care of and I was definitely not going to be held liable. After about a month, all the companies did what they promised and all charges were refunded. I then felt secure and went on about my life thinking everything was okay. Some time passed maybe another two weeks and Capital One sent me a notification that they were not recognizing my fraud claim and that it was not considered fraud. I immediately called them to figure out what was going on. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and they still will not take these fraudulent charges off my account. I have spoken to XXXX XXXX. ( they will not give me her last name ) in the fraud department what seems like hundreds of times, talked to her manager, and anyone else who will speak to me in the fraud department and get no where. They say it is my job to prove that it was not me who made the charges, which I have done to the best of my ability. I have done everything they have asked of me including filing a police report with the XXXX XXXX Police Department. They still are charging me! I have had arguments and explained to Capital One that they told me I am not liable and even took it off my account for about a month just to be put back on. They are basically calling me a liar and instead of being innocent until I am guilty they are saying I am guilty until I can figure out to prove my innocent which I feel like I have. I am not a lawyer and do not really no where to go from hear. I even told them that both other credit card companies recognized them as fraud ( thanks and great customer service from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) but Capital One says they do not care and that their fraud requirements are different. 

I am just requesting what Capital One told me when I signed up with them, that I would not be held liable for fraudulent charges and to take off the fraudulent charges. I have all detailed information to move forward with a resolution or if it is not resolved a lawsuit. 

Thanks for your Time, XXXX XXXX

Capital One,"On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I requested Capital One to remove a fraudulent charge, they refused.

Capital One,"1. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I did use a credit card to pay XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$2100.00}. The credit card was insured by Capital One Co. 
2. On XXXX/XXXX/2015, I found XXXX XXXX XXXX are cheating me for {$2100.00}. Please see consumer complaint case no XXXX XXXX of State of Hawaii. 
3. On XXXX, I called Capital One to dispute the charge of {$2100.00}. The Capital One dispute department not take their responsibilities to stop the charge of {$2100.00}. After few months, The Capital One still asked me to pay {$2100.00} and plus interests etc on my credit card which insured by Capital One Co. I think as a credit card provider, Capital One have the rights to protect their customer when a disputer case happened. 
4. On XXXX/XXXX/2015, Capital one send a letter to me that said They are not able to get {$2100.00} back to me. 
5. At this point, I am asking Government organization or consumer protection to investigate such case : Is Capital One really protected their customer? 
6. If Capital One is not able to protect their customers, why we need such credit card? 
7. I hope The Capital One is not related with XXXX to charged me {$2100.00}? 
8. I dispute the charges and related interests! 
I also did send this complaint to state of Hawaii and Utah.

Capital One,"First, I want to thank CapitalOne for resolving the previous issue with the credit line semi-efficiently, it 's just unfortunate do n't provide for such resolutions without involving the CFPB ( ca n't just email CapOne ) ... Unfortunately now have another issue but this time a slightly bigger issue. We tried to file a dispute online and the system was down, it was down for a week or so as we continued to try to no avail. We called and after several questions, were told to call back in a couple hours because the system was down ( this compared to, 'can we call you back once our systems are back up and running? ). I think companies are confused in thinking that consumers wake up seeking things to do so they are happy to spend half a day trying to resolve something that should take a simple email. I deal with things at odd hours and during those hours, really do n't care to discuss the issues on the phone ... 

So now via this complaint, CapOne needs to process the dispute we have been trying to submit. It 's for the purchase XXXX XXXX to XXXX for {$120.00}. Yes, we tried resolving this through XXXX and also through XXXX. Please also understand that we use our credit card with XXXX versus simply drafting from our account precisely for this protection that it affords ( we do n't need to buy using credit ). For the timeline and why taken so long which is part of the issue. Bought an item that shipped from XXXX so took a month to get to us so that takes us to midXXXX. Immediately installed it so within 24 hours of receiving it notified the seller that there appeared to be a problem ( it was n't completely dead, just seemingly not working right ). After that communication started I think in hindsight the seller began intentionally delaying the communications. Most every communication I had to follow back up and were given excuses like he was in the hospital, he had to wait several days for the XXXX factory to response, then XXXX XXXX XXXX ... which means another month ticked by and in the end, which by this time the unit completely failed, but the seller stated he did n't believe there was a problem and offered me {$20.00} ( {$20.00} for a {$130.00} unit that at that point was dead, obviously not a equitable resolution ). So at that point contacted XXXX who essentially said too much time had gone by even though they could clearly see the communications I detailed above ( the communications were a part of their messaging system ). So then contacted XXXX and also no resolution. All of that took a few weeks and then the issues trying to get this submitted with CapOne and here we are. Here I am also with a new heater I purchased which CapOne can find that charge a few weeks ago ( another XXXX for around {$140.00} ). 

So that is basically all of the info but if CapOne needs more, please email me as they did with the other issue. Of course they did n't respond after I responded and continued to try to call but clearly they have the ability to email which to me is more efficient.

A bank taking advantage on a tragedy since I keep making payments but I 'm falling behind trying to avoid charge off, but C.One do n't care because they are still getting payments. The other XXXX banks I do business with got a program right away for me and almost done with the accounts. Chame on CAPITAL ONE!!!!

Capital One,"In XXXX, my ex-wife opened a Capital One credit card as a joint account wherein I had no information.

Capital One,"I have received a promotion from Capital One to transfer balance to my credit card with 0 % for 18 months. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I transferred {$4500.00} to my account at XXXX and Capital One put {$4600.00} ( XXXX % transfer fee ) on my credit card. Due to restriction to the way of making transfer, I have made it online with expectation of funds arrived to my XXXX account in 10 (! ) days. I was wondered why Capital One did not simply provided checks for transfer considering that at the same time the bank offers balance transfer for my business credit card WITH checks. When I did not get money on my XXXX account in two weeks, I have contacted Capital One and XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Capital One representative said that they sent a check to XXXX, but XXXX representative said that they did not receive any checks for my account. I have written protocols of these chats and submit them with this request to CFPA. Finally, I 've been told by Capital One representative that he makes an internal request and somebody from their appropriate department will contact me in the next 10 days. Today, after waiting for 2 weeks I have decided to contact CFPA.

Capital One,"We received an email from our credit card company, Capital One, on XXXX/XXXX/16 Friday asking us to confirm recent purchases. We called on Monday, XXXX/XXXX/16 to confirm, and they said it was too late, that one of our merchant 's systems had been compromised and they may be collecting sensitive account information, so they were turning off the credit card. We asked which merchant, and they would n't tell us. We asked them to please not turn off the card because it is used for business expenses, but they said they could n't do that. They said they would send us a new card. We have waited two weeks, and still no card. Today, XXXX/XXXX/16, Monday we called to ask what the status was. They said the card was still in effect, but had just been labeled to restrict use. They never told us a new card was n't coming in the mail. We asked them to turn the existing card back on, and they finally agreed to that. Two weeks ago we asked them the same thing, and they would n't do it. This has caused an interruption in our ease of business, as the owner of the company has not had his business credit card to use for the past two weeks. Very disappointed in Capital One 's lack of communication and lack of customer service to service our needs.

Capital One,"Capital One fails to send bills each month ( especially when there is no activity on the card for the month ). When they do n't receive payment on the bills they never sent, they claim you are past due and try to charge fees.

Today, I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 from Capital One stating that they AGAIN WRONGLY updated the account as "" deceased, '' and that they notified the other credit reporting agencies of the same information. I immediately called them, once again, to notify them of this error. I am angered that this error and, more importantly, its delay in resolution negatively impacts my credit history and ability to obtain new credit or even basic services without paying prohibitive fees! This is unacceptable customer service and an unacceptable delay in correcting something as obvious as my status among the living!

Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I contacted a company by the name of XXXX on XXXX. This was an emergency clean up, for a couple who 's elderly parent was coming from XXXX. This was a Thursday, and I needed the service for the next day, Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 by XXXX. There was only a booking page and I booked the service. When I received the confirmation, it was scheduled for the next Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2016. I immediately emailed the company and told them this needed to be cancelled because I needed the service the next day. I have all of the emails. When they finally contacted me, the Customer Support, via email, said they would contact the XXXX company to try to accomodate the request. After going back and forth, they could not clean the home on the day needed. Not at one time during the emails with customer support did they tell me, in any way, that I could not get a refund. While waiting, I decided to chat with their on-line chat specialist. She is the one that said I could not get a refund, just a credit. At this time, I contacted my credit card company, Capital One ( XXXX ) .They issued the {$90.00} credit to my account while they contacted the merchant. A few weeks later, the merchant sent them some information, and they re-charged my account the {$90.00}. I was then told to send them all the info. I had ( which were emails ), there was never a receipt or terms and conditions, just an email confirmation. I sent these items on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The next day, the Capital One representatives told me that the merchant sent them terms and conditions and that the charge is non-refundable. This is not right. They never provided me with these terms and conditions and I have never used their service and definitely, I will never use their service. They are forcing me to pay for a service I never used and do n't want with vague, policies that they do not disclose upfront. Obviously, Capital One can not handle the situation. However, this XXXX company has n't provided any service and I am not paying for a service. I have paid all of my capital one balance except {$90.00} so that when this is resolved I can close this card. Customers should not be treated this way with a company trying to force someone to use their service.

Capital One,"After my recent divorce I changed my name back to my maiden name. On XXXX, 2016 I called Capital One credit card to make the change and was told that I had to speak with a supervisor. When I was connected with the supervisor I asked why I needed to speak with her and was told that there was a Cease and Desist order on my account by an attorney XXXX XXXX. They could remove immediately, of course. This was my ex-husband 's attorney. I asked how this attorney could do this when my ex-husband had no financial ties to this account nor had I been notified that this order was being placed on my account. While looking for the information I was disconnected. I spoke with my attorney the next day and she was very upset that this had happened and told me Capital One had no right putting the order on my account. She asked me to get a copy of the order. She is contacting the other attorney and getting information from that end. I called Capital One back on XXXX XXXX and after a lengthy on-hold I was told they could not find a written copy of the order, that it must have been given over the phone "" verbally ''. I could however make a request "" in writing '' that they continue to look for a written copy. When I asked them to explain exactly what this Cease and Desist order was they were very vague and what they told me made little sense. I feel as if my privacy was seriously invaded and I will be cancelling this credit card as I no longer feel safe with this company.

I received no letters or calls to warn me of this account closure or to request information. They say they sent letters and now today after 2 days on the phone, a rep said they did try to call. Their reps are not on the same page and must not have access to the same information. New information seems to materialize in their favor the more time I spend on the phone them! 
I have XXXX other cards with them, XXXX being a business card with the same info as the account they closed. They also took XXXX rewards points and applied them to my balance. 
I called them and asked them to reinstate the account and they keep saying they can not and that because they did not receive the EIN info by said date that they had to permanently close the account. They are claiming that it is against federal regulation to reopen this account. Their reps are dismissive and condecending. They do n't really seem to want to rectify the problem and they are not forthcoming with the truth regarding their choices.

The address they have for me is "" XXXX XXXX, CA '' which is for a closed account I had with them before. I applied for a new credit card last year with capital one using my XXXX XXXX address.

Capital One on XXXX XXXX credited my account back for the faulty product ( case # XXXX ) but when the retailer answered the dispute Capital One sent me a letter saying the charge ( {$620.00} ) would be placed back on my account because the T.V. transaction was a "" face to face transaction '' according to the Capital One rep and therefore there was nothing they could do. By a face to face I assume they mean the retailer did not deliver the item but I was never made aware of nor was I offered a delivery service. When I brought this to the attention of the retailer his response was "" they did n't have to tell me about the service ''.

Capital One,"I got a Capital One credit card simply in an effort to build me credit, and rarely ever used the card, and after a year came up, there was an annual fee charged to the card. I received the statement and it said that I did not need to pay because I had it set up on automatic payments through my personal XXXX account. There was an issue with the online banking and for some reason the payment was n't going through, which resulted in Capital One putting a 30 day late on my credit report. I sent this information to Capital One and they still would not remove the 30 day late that they applied to my credit report.

Capital One,"Captial One credit card has engaged in unfair, deceptive and abusive practices on my credit card with it. 

When I opened this account, there was no annual fee for the card, and I opened it because of this reason. Suddenly, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged a {$19.00} "" member fee '', without warning. XX/XX/XXXX, the only other charge on this card was {$14.00} for a telephone service, which was a balance well below the credit limit. This same amount was paid electronically on XX/XX/2016, before the due date. However, because Capital One charged me a "" gotcha '' membership fee, in contradiction to its advertised no annual fee for this card, it then charged me a late fee and froze the account because I did not pay it 's abusive charges. An electronic payment for {$53.00}, the entire balance on the card now, consisting mostly of these unfair charges, was paid today. Capital One should have this payment by tomorrow. 

Somewhat beside the point, I am away for the winter from the billing address and have not gotten Capital One 's last forwarded bill. However, it has gotten electronic, on-time payments regularly since the account was opened. 
"
Capital One,"Capital One offers a unique program to their customers through their website where a customer can combine XXXX credit cards. The minimum criteria are listed on the web site, with no other terms or conditions about the program available. XXXX of my Capital One credit cards meet this listed criteria. The website tells me I 'm still not eligible. I called capital one and spoke to a supervisor. I was informed that it was a back end decision, and although my cards meet the criteria listed on the website, their system has said I am not eligible. When I asked why, they informed me that even they did not know, and there was no way to find out. 

So on the one hand, I have met all of the criteria made publicly available to consumers. On the other hand, Capital One is saying I have not met the right criteria, and can not tell me why. 

I fully understand if there is criteria I have not met, but to simply be told "" You 're not eligible, and we ca n't tell you why '' does n't work for me, and seems more like false advertisement than anything else. If I were to be told exactly why I was not eligible, then that at least gives me something to go off of other than "" Better luck next time ''.

In XXXX, I chatted with Capital One and attempted to make a payment. The representative gave me an ID payment number, however, when I went to a bank location in XXXX to try to make a payment, they said they do not work with Capital One and I was therefore unable to make a payment. I have also tried to call Capital One multiple times to resolve this issue, but international phone calls were extremely spotty at best. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I made a phone call to Capital One, having arrived back to the US, in an effort to make an electronic payment to my credit cards.

Then, the representative said I was 120 days late and Capital One would lock my account. The representative was a bit "" wishy-washy '' and was not specific. It caused me a great deal of confusion.

I would like for Capital One to place the cards on my credit file with all late payments removed and a paid as agreed status and give me the opportunity to pay the {$180.00} to {$210.00} I owe on both of the cards collectively.

"
Capital One,"I am writing to file a complaint about Capital One. It is regarding my account numbers ending in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 
I have been an account holder of theirs since 2000. I have never paid any of the accounts late. Recently, I noticed that they increased my rate on my account ending in # XXXX to 23.15 %. They have also increased the rate on my account ending in # XXXX to 18.15 %. Both of these accounts have had balances, and they have been steadily increasing the rates on these accounts. I believe they have been doing this in a predatory manner, primarily because the accounts have balances. In comparison, my account ending in # XXXX is not in use, although it is open, and my interest rate is 10.17 %. It is also important to note that my credit bureau is in good standing, and all of my other credit cards have rates of less than 15 %. When I called Capital One to complain, I spoke with a rep named XXXX. She gave a fairly lousy excuse for the rate increase, stating prime had gone up. But she offered to lower the rate to 20.15 % for 7 months. I is also important to note that the XXXX credit cards with balances have lower cash advance rates compared to purchase rates, which makes absolutely no sense ; cash advances are a higher risk than purchases due to the nature of the transaction. Simply put, I believe they are increasing the purchase rate on my credit cards because of running balances that are not always paid in full each month. In other words, they are preying on my ability on whether I can pay the accounts off.

Capital One,"Again CapitalOne has failed in properly handling a dispute ( had issues with them in the past and they seem simply ill-equipped to deal with disputes ). We filed a dispute and then I provided all the information they asked, then we even attempted to contact them to ensure they received the information and no response. Then the other day got a notice that they never received the information so they closed the case ... Why do consumers have to be subjected to such incompetence when these companies make a fortune on the backs of consumers and businesses!?!?!?! 

I 'm attaching a copy of the information provided via a response to their email which I know they have received information at that address in the past and then also attaching our communication asking if they received the information and can see there was no response and their previous message was that at that one point they had all the information needed ...

Just prior to receiving this bill I made a purchase with this card. If I had known that this hike was about to occur I would have used a different card. XXXX with a lower interest rate. When I called to complain they told me my card was an adjustable rate card which once again I had no knowledge of that if it is indeed an adjustable rate product. When they sent me the original solicitation to sign up for the card a number of years ago that stipulation must have been hidden in the fine print. On both counts Capital One was deceptive at best.

They ask me if they were a credit counseling agency or a debt consolidation agency.

Capital One,"I have had a secured card with XXXX XXXX for almost a year now trying to rebuild my credit and have paid it off on a monthly basis with no issues. It has always been my impression that you have a 30 day grace period after your statement date with a credit card. I recently decided to get a new credit card with a {$1000.00} limit from Capitol One who would n't stop sending me offers in the mail. This particular offer said 0 % interest for 9 months and I also remember seeing this on the info when I received the card. I received my first statement showing a balance of {$320.00} on it, just over the 30 % mark that I try to shoot for. After about 3 days I paid {$320.00} dollars on it thinking I will pay a small amount of interest on the remaining {$5.00} once my next statement hits ( which I heard will help your credit even more ). Once he next months statement drops I see that because I left a whopping XXXX $ on there and did n't pay it off in full they decided I did n't get a XXXX grace period and so I did n't only pay interest on the XXXX $ but I also paid interest on the full {$320.00} for the few days I had that balance after my last statement dropped. The biggest problem is that they have a financial term for this it is called residual interest and it is a ridiculous sales practice so now I am stuck with this credit card that has 25 % interest ( ridiculous in the first place should be XXXX ) and I feel like I have to pay off in full the day after my statement drops.

Capital One,"I had a GM card for many years. I was living XXXX since XXXX and paying my card very regularly. I found that they had blocked my ability to pay over the internet XX/XX/XXXX because I tried several times and then it was too late to send a check. I suspect it was purposeful, since I had accumulated thousands of dollars towards a new GM car. Or maybe it was just a security issue about signing in from outside the XXXX. At any rate, I wrote them a letter that I wanted to pay and keep up my card, but they had put it up for collection almost immediately -- which makes me think they were purposely trying to get rid of some accounts that they felt were at risk. So now they canceled my credits and have caused me trouble with my credit report. I would like elimination of the sale of the account in the first place because it was done in a deceptive manner, and secondly to void the debt retroactively because they caused me damage and are preventing me from getting loans as I 'm back in the US now.

Capital One,"Capital one 's executive/fraud protection provides horrible service and inadequate protection for consumers. I have applied for XXXX credit limit increases and due to a fraud alert that is on my CBR, they have to call me to verify my identity. Their practices are antiquated and are not designed to protect the customer, but rather to discriminate and cause the customer undue hardship. They literally have it set up to call me once a day at the times I work. Due to me being unavailable at the time, they leave XXXX message, if they leave a message at all, explaining XXXX. I ca n't call them back to return the missed call, they ca n't call me when I am available, everything is centered around inconvenience and rude team members. I have taken this same complaint all the way to Capital one 's executive team last year in XXXX. I spoke with a nasty rude account executive and now I feel like Capital one is holding me hostage. I just have to take their subpar service and their is n't anything I can do about. At this point their practice needs to be investigated and changed.

Capital One,"I took out a credit card over seven years ago just before the financial meltdown when times were somewhat good and rents were still really low. Being that I had never had a credit card before and it had a low limit I thought I was doing okay. They kept raising the limit and the interest which raised the note each month I had to pay before I realized it and they knew on my account notes that I was on a fixed income. so I tried to do what I could. It finally got to be too much and I could n't pay on it any longer. They started with harassing calls, threats with a collection agency until finally I got the police involved. Now it is past the seven years that the FCRA says they can legally keep it on my credit, yet Capital One keeps it on there like a dog with a bone because they do n't want me to ever have a chance to start over. They want me to stay in the ditch forever. The whole point of the seven year rule was that you get to start over at some point. Not let it keep hanging like a noose around your neck forever. They also have an account of mine when I used to have a checking account which they activated some kind of auto debit which I did n't even know about and it overdrew my checking account by XXXX bucks. They did that thinking with my medical XXXX check going in automatically they would make money off of me. However, I was a little too quick for them. And so was social security. They were able to aid me in getting away from Capital One 's predatory tactics once and for all. They nor I however dreamed Capital One would chase me until my grave.

Although we can easily pay the bill, this gets to be a tight turn around and has nearly resulted in several late payments. Either Capital One is inadvertantly failing to mail their statements late, or they are sending statements too late in the hopes of generating revenue through late payment fees and interest. Or the postal service is not doing their job properly, but we have not had problems with other mail arriving late.

Capital One,"My Capital One credit card has been placed into "" Account Restricted '' status for over a week. Capital one had no good reason for initially putting the account into the status, and has refused to remove it. When I initially called the fraud department to discuss the matter on XXXX/XXXX/2016, the fraud specialist wanted to verify some balance transfers that I requested. We were able to verify that no problem. 

However, that is when the problem started. They wanted to verify two payments I had made from XXXX separate checking accounts on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. We had to conference call each credit union to verify that the funds have cleared. For the payment on XX/XX/XXXX, we were able to do that without a problem. Unfortunately, the credit union that I made the payment from on XX/XX/XXXX does not verify information over the phone for account security. They suggested that capital one fax in a request for information and they would respond by fax. Capital One indicated this was not acceptable. Instead, the fraud agent asked me to send in a copy of a recent statement from the checking account. I provided that information to capital one, and called back a few days later. They said that the information was insufficient to remove the restriction and I had to provide transaction details showing that the payment cleared from the checking account. I did that, and capital one said that was not sufficient to remove the restriction. I also provided a letter from the bank indicating that I owned the checking account in question ( the letter had my name, my address, and the checking account number and was signed by a bank officer ). That was also not sufficient to remove the restriction. 

Capital One 's payment verification system is incredibly stupid. Their employees continuously blame me because the credit union wo n't give out information over the phone. At no time prior to the payment being made did Capital One indicate that this type of verification would be needed to accept an ach payment from a checking account. Moreover, they are unwilling to return the payment and let me replace the payment from a different bank that they can verify. In fact, I sent in bill payments while the account has been frozen with the hope that would be sufficient for Capital One. It was not, and there is now a large credit balance on the account. I have never had a payment returned, or been late with a payment on this account. Capital One had no good reason to initially put the account under review. They said something about my protection, which is a complete lie. Mind you, the payment in question was made about 3 weeks ago. The payment has not been returned and Capital One refuses to release the account restriction or tell me what exactly they need to do so. This behavior should be illegal ; as it is unethical for the company to treat me like a criminal despite having no returned payments or late payments on my account.

Capital One,"I received email offer for a credit card with great cash-back benefits from Capital One Banking. I have a money market account with XXXX XXXX balance with this bank.

"
Capital One,"Firstly, I would like to point out that I am being penalized unfairly by a financial institution whose actions described herein appear to be at best arbitrary and at worst discriminatory. I have a perfect record of one time payments with the exception of a department store card issued by capital one. I own my home and have excellent credit. I missed a 30-day deadline for one of my credit cards during XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. All other bills were paid timely. I was out of the country and I made sure to pay my bills before I left however, this particular payment was an oversight. I had no idea that I was late with a payment, if I had, I would have immediately paid this bill over the phone. Further, I ensured that I had international phone service abroad for any emergencies that may come up while I was away. I never revived a call or voicemail indicating that my payment was late. Missing this payment had nothing to do with my creditworthiness as far as being able and willing to meet my financial obligations. When I returned to the country and realized that I had missed a payment, I immediately brought my account current. I submitted a request to the company to remove the flag in order to restore my standing and I explained that this was a one time error that would not repeat itself. They denied my request and did not give a reason as to why. I believe that this not only is a poor business practice, but it also penalizes me unfairly whereby others have been granted this request. I understand this company has a history of appearing to make credit decisions based on certain demographic information. I 'm XXXX and XXXX. That is the only notable difference between me and another individual who was granted this request. Although this is not a credit decision, per se, the denial of good faith action from a financial institution will negatively impact my credit for years to come. I came to my creditor in good faith to advise that this was a one-time error that was exacerbated by me being out of the country and unawares of my late status. For instance, I received no call or voicemail once my payment was past due, at a minimum I expect the bank to exercise certain actions such as a phone call when a payment has been missed. I ask that the CFPB intervene on my behalf and request that the credit card company remove the 30 day late flag from my credit report, and restore my perfect repayment history. Further, I would like to ask the financial institution to provide an explanation around the decision to deny a goodwill gesture or accept certain other requests.

Capital One,My credit account with capital one bank has been restrict because of fraud issue I spoke to many managers and nobody can resolve the problem. Had a three way conversation with my water bill so they can confirm that I 'm the right person. After verify ask me for more personal information. Sent and they told me that has been receive and have to wait 3 days after that when I call they keep saying that never receive anything. Bad service has capital one bank
Capital One,My friend add me As join account to his credit card but they restrict the account because of the fraud issue after summit all my information and validate my information gave me hard time in customer service because they never receive anything and always speak to someone who is out the country and have no idea about law in this country.
Capital One,"I have been a customer since XXXX. In the XX/XX/XXXX I lost my job and a payment that I made in XXXX of XXXX was returned, I obtained a new job and paid the late fees, returned check fees and all other fees to bring my account current. At the time, my account was over the credit limit and a "" restricted '' status had appeared on the website. I assumed that the restricted status was due to the over the credit limit and never questioned this. My husband and I are looking to buy a house this summer so we are improving our debt to income ratio and preparing, we suffered a file this past XXXX at my child hood home and my mother will be coming to live with us, so sale is very important to my family. Well last night I went on the website to ensure the payment in full of the account posted. I was surprised to see that the account was still listed as restricted, so I called the number it requested me to call and was transferred multiple times before speaking with the fraud department that told me my account had been closed in XXXX of XXXX due to my returned check. I became angry and asked for a supervisor who when I threatened the XXXX hung up on me. I called back, my first call has been 53:20. I advised of my concerns again and was again transferred to a fraud supervisor who informed me he did not have access to unrestricted my account and that his manager would need to do it but he had left for the evening. Call # 2 lasted 36:53 to be called I 'd get a call back. I decided to file a complaint with XXXX but still wanted this resolved, so I called the number on the bbb website once last night was resulted in my again being transferred this time to collections and now a case being opened with a callback within 7-10 days, this is unacceptable. I called again this morning to be transferred and told there was absolutely nothing anyone could do to unrestricted my account. 5 hours of my life wasted with no resolution and misinformation"
Capital One,"A few months ago, I contacted Capital One VISA to dispute several charges from a company, XXXX XXXX or XXXX, who over a 10 month period charged me approx. {$2000.00}. It started from an internet 'trial ' offer of {$3.00} to try eye serum and {$4.00} 'trial ' offer for face cream. Once it arrived, I discovered the pump on the XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX bottle was defective and required removing the lid and scooping the goo out with a finger. The face cream was greasy and did not absorb well. I decided to phone the company to discontinue the products only to find the number XXXX to be disconnected. From that point, I returned all future unopened deliveries and labeled "" Cancelled '' on each one, assuming I would be credited. It was n't until months later when I noticed the various, suspicious product names on the XXXX statements that seemed to rotate each month. These product names were XXXX ', XXXX ', XXXX , XXXX '. I never ordered additional products other than the XXXX trial offers that totaled less than {$10.00}. The first person at Capital One VISA customer service I spoke to in attempting to rectify the problem was employee # XXXX. She listened politely to my dilema and explained that Capital One would send a dispute letter to the merchant while temporarily reversing all the charges. If the merchant did not respond, the credits would hold and If Capital One VISA believed these charges to be fraudulent, all charges would remain dismissed as well. The maximum credit period was normally 90-120 days but could cover the entire 10 month period if fraud was evident. At that moment, it felt great that justice would be done in hopes that potentially thousands of other trusting consumers would not be duped as I was. My optimism was short lived as I received a letter XXXX/XXXX/16 from Capital One stating they were reapplying all the charges and if I still wanted to dispute these charges, I was to contact the merchant directly. I then contacted XXXX XXXX, also doing business as XXXX ' and XXXX XXXX ', etc. and spoke to XXXX. 
She explained they would only give me a 30 day credit until I told her I would file a complaint with Consumer Protection. She placed me on hold then returned to offer a 90 day credit. When I asked her why the change, she replied it was due to my threat to report the company to the Consumer Protection Agency. ( Frankly, I was a little surprised she would admit it. ) She e-mailed me confirmation to that agreement but did not send it to Capital One. Therefore, I did not receive the credits. All in all, I have spent over 20 hours and have spoken to 17 Customer Service people ( on the phone ) with Capital One VISA attempting to correct this cluster. The customer service supervisors were the least helpful, especially XXXX and XXXX who shared the phrase "" Capital One has done everything they can ''. Really?.... and I pay 17.9 % for protection? Hopefully, your agency can be of assistance. Thank you."
Capital One,"I filled out a application for Capital One on XXXX XXXX for Capital One they pulled my credit and then contacted me and said I needed to fill out another application that they did not have my social security number so I reapplied and another credit report was pulled. XXXX has already fixed the problem. XXXX and XXXX need to remove XXXX of the hard pulls each like XXXX did. It was Capital One Fault that this occurred. The records will show this. XXXX is on the reports according to XXXX. 
Thank You XXXX XXXX"
Capital One,I have been approve a capital one credit card after been approve they froze the account because I have cards as join account and they think it 's fraud but any way the problem now after summiting my personal information they do n't accept my passport because they said its from different country they are so XXXX ...
Capital One,I have been approve for capital one bank a credit card since XXXX 2015. They froze my account because of a fraud issue. Sent all my personal information many times every time I call customer service they restrict the accounts that I have as a join account too. This bank it 's really bad in customer services and policies. Someone has to do something against them because they affect my credit more.
Capital One,"Capital One offered what is called "" Choose it '' to help pay off a large purchase over time with no interest. I continued to pay off my "" Balance Due '' every month only to find out my "" Balance Due '' did not include the amount I had chosen to place in my "" Choose it '' "" bucket. '' ( I 'm using quotes because this is how the manager on the phone referred to these things. ) I do most of my banking on my mobile device. Therefore, I 've been paying my "" balance due '' every month thinking I 've long paid off the "" Choose it '' balance as well. No, they hide that balance still outstanding as "" SpecialPurch '' under the interest charge calculation on the statement. Additionally, it is at the very bottom of the statement. NOWHERE on my mobile device can I get this additional balance due unless I bring up my PDF paper statement. I trusted the "" balance due '' was indeed the WHOLE balance due and paid it off EVERY month. As I do pay my balance very month, I really should not have taken advantage of this "" special offer, '' but I did and now I am sorry. 
My concern is n't as much for me, although it makes me very angry. My concern is for others who need a break with interest charges and might not pay off the balance every month. 
Additionally, I feel it is BAD PRACTICE for Capital One to not put SOMETHING, ANYTHING alongside the "" Balance Due '' that states "" You may wish to pay off this Special Purchase balance off, too so you do n't incur interest by this date. Therefore your actual balance due is $ XXXX. '' Thank you,"
Capital One,Both of my capitol one credit card accounts are restricted. I can not get a reason why nor have this restriction lifted so I can use my cards.
Capital One,"Capital One credit card is in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX name. He passed away on XX/XX/2015 and died intestate and insolvent. I have disputed this claim and wish to have this removed from my report. XXXX XXXX, had total control over this account. It was not a joint account. When paying the account each month in full, if I disputed a charge they had to receive permission from XXXX XXXX to talk to me. They should try talking to him now."
Capital One,"I was already being sent a new credit card from Capital One as they had received information that clients may be comprised when shopping at a particular merchant. However, I got my new card, activated it, had it active for about a week, when suddenly i 'm charged {$190.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX for the old number! Not only was that number supposed to be deactivated, someone was still able to use it to make a new purchase. Capital One claims it is because they will allow subscriptions that used the old card number, to pass through to the new card number ; in other words they are still connected, despite being given the impression that they were not. I told them I have never shopped with XXXX XXXX XXXX and therefore this being a new purchase, regardless if it was a subscription, should have been denied as it was completely new, and therefore a new subscription that should never be allowed to be used on a deactivated card. I had already cut my card up too. The more I spoke with them the less confident I felt in their abilities to protect me from fraud, as because it was a subscription they would just let it be processed without calling me first despite it being an old number that was supposed to have been deactivated. I was told I can call XXXX XXXX XXXX with them to get them to cancel the subscription, but apart from that all they can do is block. But I do n't feel they will really block them. I am upset that they do not understand that if I have NEVER used someone, regardless of subscription, then why would you allow a NEW subscription to be used on a "" supposedly '' deactivated card?? I will be speaking with them more but am heavily considering canceling them."
Capital One,"XX/XX/2016, I noticed that Capital one had charged me a {$39.00} annual fee. I knew that I would never willingly sign up for a card that carried a fee like this. I called and complained and they eventual removed the XXXX fee. 
However, going back in the account I realized I had been charged this fee for the previous 9 years. I called Capital One and requested a copy of my original card member agreement. They promised to mail it to me. It never came. Then I called again. They again promised to mail it to me and stated they had mailed it to about a week prior to that call. Again I waited about about three weeks and nothing ever came so I called again and asked for a supervisor. The asserted that they had mailed it to me on XXXX XXXX. However, they also said they would mail it and fax it to me. It is now XXXX XXXX and I have never received anything. This process started XX/XX/2016. I feel that they do not want to provide it to me or can not provide it to me. As a result I can not show that I was overcharged {$350.00} during the past 9 years."
Capital One,"I missed a XXXX XXXX flight due to late cruise ship arrival at XXXX On Saturday XXXX XXXX, 2016. I could not call and I did not expect a refund. That day I called to make a new reservation for the following day. I then called hotels and found they we all booked due to weather issues. I immediately called back Spirit to cancel the reservation and was told that I could not because it was less than seven days since I made the reservation. Well that was obvious. I argued to no avail. I later found out that I could cancel the reservation within seven days as per XXXX XXXX on-line cancellation policy, see attached document. I then called and spoke to a Capital One reservation agent and described my plight the agent, name XXXX, Operator Number XXXX she assured me I would not get charged. I was subsequently was charged and disputed the charge see attached document dated XXXX XXXX, 2016. The charge was subsequently reversed. I was notified there was additional information from XXXX XXXX by Capital One on XXXX XXXX, 2016, but I did not receive any additional information until XXXX XXXX, 2016. Capital One stated that they were recharging me the {$490.00}. The letter XXXX XXXX sent see attached is completely untrue and they failed to follow their own policy. I received a letter on XXXX XXXX, from Capital One that completely ignored the issues I outlined in XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016 letter to them and they closed the case. Capital One did not follow required guidelines in resolving my complaint. The issue was not resolved within 2 billing periods as required by law. I have never felt so aggrieved by XXXX companies as I do these XXXX. Please help me to remove the charge from my account. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX of XXXX I realized I missed my XXXX payment which was due on XXXX XXXX. Prior to this I had NEVER missed a payment but dealing with XXXX XXXX, I forgot. I called Capital One IMMEDIATELY and got an offshore rep. She was kind enough to waive my late fee for XXXX ( since the XXXX payment was n't due til the XXXX, there was no late payment for that month, at the time the bill was {$65.00} ), she said with the credit for the late fee of {$25.00}, my payment due would be {$40.00}. I decided to pay an even {$50.00}. I asked the rep numerous times if this payment brought my account current through XXXX since the bill also included my XXXX payment and she said YES. 

I had to leave XXXX for my family members ' funeral and other family affairs so I would have been gone from the end of XXXX to the end of XXXX of XXXX, because I knew I would have limited phone and Internet service, I decided to set up automatic payment with Capital One. Needless to say, the setup failed and I missed XXXX 's and XXXX 's payment. I disputed with Capital One and they decided to remove the late payment and reporting to the XXXX credit bureaus according to XXXX different conversations I had with reps and supervisors combined. I was looking for the written confirmation and they said it will be in the mail and my report will update in 30 days. I received the letter alright, as well as an update on my report but it was nothing the reps and supervisors told me previously. The letter stated the error was not on their end in regards to the auto pay and the reporting is correct and will not be removed ( TOTALLY contradicting what I was told in previous calls with XXXX to XXXX different people ). I decided to take the blame as in truth and in fact, they never received the payment, whether through my error or their system. It was n't until I was scouring my report that I realized the XXXX payment that I made on the XXXX was being reported as late. 

I called Capital One and the agent explained that even though I received the credit of {$25.00} and paid {$50.00} ( a total of {$75.00} credit on a {$65.00} bill ) I still needed to pay the full {$65.00} that was due at the time, so essentially I was being reported late for {$15.00} because the rep at Capital One did not know her job and told me I was paid in full with her {$25.00} credit and my {$50.00} payment. The rep that I was speaking with ( who said he was a supervisor ) stated he will remove the 60 day late payment stemming from the XXXX miscommunication but will not do anything about the 30 day late from XXXX, I told him that was fair and went on my way, this was XXXX XXXX. 

I called on XXXX XXXX to make sure all was going according to plan and sure enough the rep I spoke with this time said nothing is being done and I was advised wrong but they will review the recording and if that is what I was told, they will honor it ( this rep was a supervisor ) I was told she will review this and be in close contact with me. I was given her name and personal number, I was called on the XXXX of XXXX to say they are still reviewing but after that, silence. I called and left numerous VM for her on the number she gave me and, NOTHING, not even a call back. I called the XXXX number, I tried getting through to this supervisor again and received nothing but crickets. 

Capital One and the agents as well as the supervisors are crooked to say the least and needs to be brought into the spotlight! Shady, lying people they are and as a consumer I am now suffering because these reps are untrained and could care less about the consumers, as long as it 's not their life then business as usual I guess."
Capital One,"Financed motorcycle through XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX. Paid off account to {$0.00} balance on XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Contacted Capital One about title and was informed original title was sent XXXX XXXX XXXX. Never received. Contacted again and was informed that Release of Lien was sent XXXX XXXX XXXX. Never received. Capital One phone representatives have claimed documents were sent to correct address via USPS with no tracking number. 
Included as an attachment is the statement noting that I have a {$0.00} balance on the account. Also included is a scanned receipt of purchase on XXXX XXXX. 
DMV confirmed that Capital One has to send me either the original title or the Release of Lien due to it being a paper copy. 

I originally contacted Texas Attorney General 's Consumer Protection who referred me to the Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner who referred me to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency who referred me to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."
Capital One,I see judgements for amount that I had no knowledge about. I also see XXXX Texas addresses where I never lived and wrong spelling of my mother 's middle name.
Capital One,"was told on hold on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. on XXXX XXXX XXXX saw my credit report I was 90 days late and owed XXXX dollars. called was told they would call back XXXX hours. wrote called 4 more times. sent payment. requested account be closed in XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. they refuse transfer my call 3 times an hour later they claim they will call me back .will not close account, give me my balance or send me a statement. please HELP."
Capital One,"XX/XX/XXXX, I was solicited by Capital One to consent to a pre-approved credit card, which was advertised as having "" No hidden fees '' on the promotional mailer, and in television commercials running at the time. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid my balance on time and in full ; on XX/XX/XXXX I was charged interest in the amount of {$110.00}, which was interest from the time of the prior statement cycle to the time my payment posted ( again, on time ). This card has no "" grace period, '' which is deceitful, and relatively unusual, if my other cards are any indication."
Capital One,"Regarding XXXX payment processing, CapitalOne has a business practice, which I believe is unethical and should be illegal. I have a PDF file ( attached ) with date/time stamp from my CapitalOne on-line account records to substantiate my complaint. Specifically, when I log into the CapitalOne website to pay my credit card 's monthly bill, their website states that I must make the payment before XXXX. in order for the payment to be posted on the same day ( It used to be XXXX XXXX EST a few years ago ). Currently, this payment cut-off deadline, at XXXX XXXX is four hours before XXXX on the due-date. If a card holder ( like me ) makes a payment ON THE DUE DATE, but between XXXX and XXXX, CapitalOne sets the posting date for the following day and counts the payment as a late payment, charges a late fee, and then use this event as XXXX of XXXX allowable late payment events per year to justify raising the APR rate - significantly. This happens even when payments are made on the due date before midnight within the same timezone as the billing address ( EST in my case ). I suspect that Capital One and other card issuers are using this tactic to collect fees they do not earn and to justify raising APR rates. This practice should be illegal and must be stopped. The correct processing is that all on-line payments scheduled by XXXX XXXX of the due date, should be posted as paid on the due date and accepted as an on-time payment."
Capital One,"Last year, I applied for and was given a credit-card by Capital One. Under their rules, a starter account is opened in the amount of {$300.00}, and then, per their rules, if you make 5 consequitive on time payments, they raise your credit limit to {$500.00}. I reached that level. In XXXX, I filed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy, and they ( Capital One ) closed my account even though I DID NOT INCLUDE THEM IN THE BANKXXXX! My payments were always on time, and when I last looked, I had a balance of about {$120.00}, which I tried to pay, but was locked out of the account. I have written two letters to them, and I get no response. I offered that if they issued a card again with either the {$500.00} or {$300.00} credit line, minus what I owed, I would pay it upon receipt. I had no intention of trying to get out of paying them, my intent was to start rebuiding my credit. I did not deserve to have my credit yanked for no reason. I never missed a payment, my payments were on time, sometimes before they were due, and I usually paid more than the amount due. They do not respond, they offer no relief or options, much less an apology for closing an account that was not delinquent. Recently! I applied for another one of their starter cards, and was denied, with the response being I did or do owe them money! I owe them about {$120.00}, and had they kept the account open, it would have been paid. This is blantantly misleading and wrong for them to not allow me to have the card, and secondly, since I did not include them, I should have been allowed to pay what I owed. I do not have the account no anymore, they can look me up by my social XXXX"
Capital One,"I applied for a capital one card back may of last year. this pass fall of last year i took out a cash advance. i sent in payments amount that should have paid XXXX of the cash advance amount. When i look at my XXXX statement i was shocked that my cash advance amount had not deminised at all. So i called capital one to see why my cash advance amount had n't went down. I was told that after they fees amount have been deducted then whats left over would be split and XXXX half of that amount would be subtracted from the purchase amount and the other half would be used to reduce the cash advance amount. So I decided to continue to pay far more than the minimum amount due so that was left over would completely reduce or in my case totally gotten rid of the cash advance amount. Three months late to my shock the cash advance amount was still the same. Being greatly concern and in anxiety about this I called capital one again. Now they tell me that I have to pay the entire balance on my card ( purchase and cash advance ) amount in order for the cash advance amount goes away.They said that cash advance amount would remain the same forever, and they will continue charging interest on the full amount continually forever otherwise. This is criminal, i would fair better at XXXX robbery. This is so wrong on so many levels."
Capital One,"I used this credit card with no problem before. I had a dispute still no resolved with them. Then it went into collection. Then A law firm is NOW involved with it, Please help me resolve this issue."
Capital One,MY ACCOUNT WAS BLOCK FOR USING THE WRONG ACCOUNT FOR MY CREDIT CARD FOR CAPITAL ONE NA I HAVE TRY TO WORK WITH THIS COMPANY SEVERAL TIMES DOING WHAT THEY HAVE ASK ME TO DO AND TO CALL THE OTHER BANK WITH THEM ON THE LINE AND EVERY SPECIALIST AND EVERY TIME I HAVE TRY TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON THE ACCOUNT CAPITAL ONE HAS REFUSE MY ACCOUNT. AND NOW HAS MY ACCOUNT OVER THE LIMITED.
Capital One,"I signed up for a CapitalOne card in XXXX, 2014, but somehow CapitalOne recorded my social security number incorrectly. Because ones social security number is required as confirmation to access your account to pay bills online and to speak with customer service representatives, I was unable to access my account to make payments until finding the time to complete a 2-hour phone call in XXXX, 2014 to correct my information. During this period, I missed 3 payments because I could n't access my account. I believed that these late payments should be removed because I was unable to access my account due to a mistake by the credit card company. 

I contacted CapitalOne to remove these late payments from the credit rating agencies ' records, which they said they would do. However, upon checking a month later, I found out that CapitalOne had not disputed the late payments, but instead had confirmed them to the rating agencies and preemptively filed a dispute correction. When I asked for them to send me a copy of the"
Capital One,"XXXX XXXX reported my credit card ending in XXXX as 30 days late for XXXX 2016. I made my payment using the app. They had just upgraded the app with new features. I added a new bank account and made my payment using the new app. They called me a few days later telling me that my payment was returned. I told them that this was not possible. I asked which account did they use they advised of my old bank account. I explained to them that I added a new account. I explained that it must have been an error with the app. I made a new payment and was assured that I would not have a problem. I just checked my credit and they reported me 30 days late. I plan to litagate this matter. I closed all of my accounts with them. The agent I spoke with tonight admitted that he could see the mistake, however after he spoke with a supervisor he came back and said he could no longer get the item corrected and that I had to do a dispute. His supervisor advised him that my account is reporting accurately."
Capital One,On XXXX/XXXX/16 my XXXX credit report showed that there were a Capital One and a XXXX bank hard inquiries. I called both banks and they both reported not to have any information on the matter. On XXXX/XXXX/16 XXXX reported again that Capital One had another hard inquiry for trying to open an account. I called capital one and they reported that as a matter of fact someone tried to open an account with Capital One. The representative said she closed the account that was opened on my behalf and report it as fraudulent.
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX fraudulent transactions appeared on my Capital One credit card in the amounts of {$250.00}, {$120.00} and {$500.00}. All of these transactions were with Nordstroms ( the merchant ). I have never shopped or purchased anything from Nordstroms in my life. I received a text notification regarding these charges on XXXX XXXX, XXXX in the afternoon and within moments, contacted the Capital One fraud department. Capital One neutralized all three of these charges on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Nordstroms credited my account with {$250.00}. The effect of this was that my account was credited in the amount of {$250.00} two times, once by Capital One and once by Nordstroms. I recognized this was an error and paid Capital One, rightfully so, {$250.00}, which neturalized that transaction again. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX Capital One adjusted my account by adding {$250.00} and {$500.00} to my balance. As mentioned above, I neutralized the {$250.00} double credit. I received a letter unsigned, but dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX from Capital One, apparently from XXXX XXXX from the Customer Fraud Protection unit stating that {$500.00} was being added to my account because the account was credited two times in the amount of {$500.00}, once by Capital One and once by Nordstroms. A few days later, I received the exact same letter from Capital One. This is NOT CORRECT. Nowhere on any statement or account activity document does a {$500.00} credit from Nortstroms show up. I initiated numerous calls to the Customer Fraud Protection unit at XXXX, the number on the letter, These calls were an exercise in major frustration mainly because it was so difficult to understand the so-called customer service representatives because of the lack of their English language skills ( and yes, I did press the correct selection for English ). I left a return number for XXXX XXXX on several occasion XXXX and never received a return call or message. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I managed to get connected to XXXX XXXX ( I think XXXX stands for XXXX ). She went over this situation thoroughly and told me that this was a mistake made by someone other than her and she would see to it that {$500.00} would be removed from my account. She indicated that another department made this mistake. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and the {$500.00} remains on my account. I made several more calls to the number on the letter and was unable to convey my concerns in a manner that was understood by the customer service reps ( again, a language issue ). All they could say was that the issue was under investigation. So, This issue has been around now since XX/XX/XXXX and I seem unable to resolve it with Capital One. I am not sure whose fault this is, Capital One or Nordstroms, but I do n't believe it is mine. I called and reported the fraud, answered all questions asked of me ( which were mostly what my account number was ) and received a new credit card with a different account number. I am a reasonable savvy person in the financial and banking arena, but I have never, ever had a situation like this remain unresolved for so long. I am not sure what kind of problem Capital One has and I feel totally helpless and at their mercy."
Capital One,"I applied for a capital one XXXX business card for an llc for which I am a member. The card is now reporting to my personal credit report. I called capital one and they said they would switch it to the company credit report. However, they called me weeks later and informed me that they added the TIN to the card but will not remove it from my personal credit. This is not a personal debt. It is the debt of the company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and paid for by the company. If it were a personal card, it should not have been marketed as a business card and to the business with the business name on it and reporting to the business credit report. If it is indeed a business card, then it should be taken off my personal credit report. One of the other llc members also has a XXXX business card, that includes me on it as well as the business name, and capital one will not allow me to close that account because they are saying that is her personal card, even though it has the company name and tin attached to it also."

Capital One,"Filed a complaint with Capitol one credit card company requesting that they investigate credit card fraud. My information was stolen and used without my permission. And pursuant to the request that they cease in reporting it as a delinquant issue on my credit report. I recieved an answer that they verified that it was my card, however that wasnt the complaint the complaint was that it was used fraudulantly. They refuse to close and remove the negative information from my credit report. I work for the DOJ and I am a Military VET this is hurting my ability to advance my career and also buy a home for me and my family."
Capital One,Capital one sent me new cards with new numbers they did not have the info from my other card before doing it. All my payments and charges were all doubled on the bill. I knew I paid it off a few times yet they refused to acknowledged the payments made on the other cards. They have done it 3 times with XXXX card. Having no record when using paperless makes it easy for them to deny they payments it also helps them to rip people off if they think you have no record of the info. I think paperless is a nightmare.I have requested that they go over the bills 5 times now each time I pay more money it 's gotten out of hand. I am a XXXX woman my husband is XXXX we have no help with our problems. Please help me get to the bottom of my problems.
Capital One,On XX/XX/XXXX I recieved a letter from capitol one concerning a application for a credit card. This application was NOT submitted by me. I called capitol one and talked with XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and informed her I did not apply for credit.XX/XX/2016 recieved letter confirming that application was fraudulent.
Capital One,"Capitalone is asking for a high minimum payment in the amount of XXXX, the account is past due and over limit currently, which I understand. However, they are asking for such a high amount as it almost exceeds my weekly paycheck. I requested the amount lowered, however, was denied saying the account is again over limit and past due. The account is past due because I have fallen behind on payments with the account as well as other credit accounts I currently hold. I take care of my mother and have been paying for her medication ( s ). I did make a payment in the amount of XXXX, however, a stop payment had to be placed due to insufficient funds. My paycheck amount this week is lower than usual due to a payroll discrepancy, a stop payment had to be placed as the payment was already in process."
Capital One,"My wife and I have a Capital One credit card. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I received a fraud alert regarding a charge over {$19000.00}. 
I immediately alerted Capital One that this charge is fraudulent. 
On the phone I was reassured that Capital One recognized the charge as fraudulent. 
Over the next months, I had numerous phone calls with Capital One representatives, including several managers. The representatives told me that the charge will go away when their "" internal investigation '' is finished. I was told this could take 2 months but in the meantime Capital One would erase any fees and interest. However, for six months I keep on getting the monthly statement with the charge of {$19000.00} and with new fees and interest. 
A few months ago I was assured that the charge will definitely not show up anymore and neither would any fees and interest. However, again, every month I continue to see this charge with new fees and interest on my statement. 
I have spent hours on the phone. It is a very high charge and I feel helpless get this issue resolved."
Capital One,"In the course of getting approved for a credit card from Capital One, I reviewed my credit reports and discovered they had conducted a "" hard inquiry '' on several of my credit reports multiple times without my express authorization. Fortunately, my XXXX report was frozen and not able to be accessed. However, my XXXX and XXXX reports were not, and now have a total of XXXX hard inquires from Capital One! This is ridiculous, and unnecessarily damages my otherwise excellent credit. I authorized only XXXX inquiry when I applied initially, not XXXX. As a result, while applying for another card I was denied. On the adverse action letter it stated the reason for denials was "" too many recent inquiries '' ... unsurprising I suppose considering the damage Capital One recklessly incurred to my credit reports. This denial of my applications has had a tangible and negative effect on me ; I was counting on getting approved. I am hopeful the CFPB can assist me in getting this situation remedied ASAP."
Capital One,I am a victim of identity theft and I have advised the company the account was opened by the person that stole my identity. After several attempts of disputing this with the credit bureaus and contacting them directly they still say I am the one that opened the account which is completely false. I have requested copies of all documentation on the account and they have failed to provide this information. I am currently working with a lawyer to resolve this issue as well. I just need to clear my name from this company.
Capital One,"I opened my Capital one card after being sent a letter telling me that I was preapproved based on my credit score. The card is supposed to help build your credit and I was told that after making on time payments for XXXX consecutive months, my credit line would be raised $ XXXX {$300.00}. After the 5 months, I received a letter stating that because I had demonstrated such responsible use of the card, they were raising my limit {$500.00}. I continued to use the card and make all my payments on time. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I log onto make a payment and see that my account is being restricted. I call customer service and was transferred to "" the executive office '' where a rather rude and XXXX tells me that my account has been closed and I was mailed a letter. I asked her why and she said this was due to pending or past legal action against me. I asked her for the date of the alleged legal action and she tells me she does not know, but that I can call my XXXX office or the state. I requested to speak with a supervisor after she transferred me back to the main customer service line and was told that the department was closed and I could not leave information for a callback. For the next several days I contacted my XXXX and also the XXXX Court ( State and Federal ) in my state to inquire about the legal action Capital one is saying was the reason for my account being closed, no one has any record of legal action against me. I even paid for a background check on myself and again nothing! I requested to not be charged a late fee due to the lack of information and being told I would need to address the issue with outside agencies. This morning I receive an email from them saying that I am now being assessed late fees and penalties from them as well."
Capital One,capital one bank keeps trying to collected money from me and i paid them and i cant even get another credit card because of them they keep threatining me
Capital One,"In reviewing my most recent Capitalone statement it came to my attention that, though the beginning balance on my statement was {$5000.00} and I made payments during the statement period totalling {$4400.00} leaving a remaining balance of {$630.00}, I was charged over {$100.00} in interest for that period. I saw on the statement that the amount that was used to calculate the interest was {$5400.00}, which made no sense to me. 
When I called to inquire and ask why the interest was calculated on that amount rather than the {$630.00} that represented the remaining balance, XXXX ( laughing ) told me that the interest is based on the "" average daily balance '' inclusive of new purchases? I asked her when this changed as I have had this account and used it regularly for nine months, have always followed the same pattern of paying as I go with this account and have never paid any amount of interest before. Continuing to laugh, she said she would refund the {$100.00} and make a note in the file. I advised her that in all my years of using credit cards, not XXXX company has ever charged interest on new purchases before the statement is even issued. She continued to laugh and I advised her that I would be contacting you with a complaint. She laughed again. I told her I was happy she was having so much fun on her job. I think it 's time to close this account as I have been hearing this company has not been treating consumers fairly. Now that I have had my own experience, I believe it 's a good idea."
Capital One,"I have a dispute with XXXX XXXX over a a cancellation fee they are charging me. The merchant has provided capital one dispute team, with inaccurate false information and Captial one 's dispute account managers are not doing their due diligence in investigating the situation. I have been told misinformation since XXXX XXXX, 2016 and my last encounter with the rudest account manager i have experienced there is what has drawn me to file this complaint. He proved to me that they are not reading the submitted materials. They are interpreting hard facts in the favor the merchant. THe last account manager, Said he was the HIGHEST person I would be able to talk even if the information he provided was inaccurate. I asked him for his name and ID and his name is XXXX. His attitude and knowledge exemplifies the on going problems that Cap One has with proving customers with accurate, timely information."
Capital One,"I disputed charges on my credit card XX/XX/XXXX with Capital One. It appeared my credit card information was stolen as there were almost {$1100.00} in charges that I had never seen before in a period of two hours on one day. I notified Capital One and spoke to XXXX different people confirming the matter. I was advised I would not be charged for it and the charges would come off my card. They did and a new credit card with a new credit card number was sent to me. The case was then closed. Fast forward to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and I received adjustments on my new card of over {$1100.00} for those same charges!!! I called as soon as I saw that and after XXXX minutes and no less than XXXX representatives, I got nowhere. I received XXXX different answers and a promise that a manager would call me to resolve this by the next day. No one called. I then tried resolving via online chat to no avail. That rep told me managers do not call customers ... I demanded to speak to their manager via chat who was of NO help. He refused to give me their legal department 's contact information and told me I have to call in ( again ). I told him repeatedly that I do NOT have time to waste another 40+ minutes for their mistake in which they are now reporting that balance to the credit reporting agencies. He would not assist and kept repeating I must call in. I made it very clear I was going to resort to a complaint with the CFPB as I can not repay {$1100.00} that I do not have. I am a XXXX person with medical bills that must be paid or I die. I am devastated by all of this and just want it resolved. Capital One will NOT address the matter. They claim a letter was mailed ... I never got a letter. They will not resolve via phone ... I keep getting transferred or told I need to call back or placed on hold for large periods of time. 

Please help me. I do n't know what to do at this point."
Capital One,I have a family member listed as a authorized on my account. I received a letter that Capital One to destroy the card because the authorized user was removed because of past criminal activity. They were arrested but never convicted. I called and was told the decision woul not be reversed. I am responsible for the account not the authorized user. Again arrested but not convicted. Thank You.

Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX I received a fax through my job fax machine it was for a vacation package and it stated it was through XXXX and it was also from my HR department. So I called the XXXX number on the flyer I asked them in a ton of questions I also asked if he was XXXX he told me yes he was XXXX after speaking with the man I felt comfortable I gave him my credit card over the phone I asked for confirmation he said once I sign my credit card slip I will receive my vouchers and my confirmation and all the links to pick my hotels. So i esigned the credit card statement then I got my vouchers and I also got my emails I clicked on the link when I got home and something did n't seem right I did a lot of investigating and I found out that they have reports that this was a scam I look them up and sure enough they were on the scam list I called them back the next morning and I told them that this was a scam and they hung up the phone on me, I then called back and tried to cancel they said I could not cancel my vacation package because it was Final sale. I called my credit card company Capital One they told me not to worry that they will get my money back and I will not be responsible for this they did an investigation and then I received a call that the investigation was closed and they could not retrieve my money back. After they called me and told me that I ca n't receive my money back, i called again and I told them to call on three-way with me to show them that this is a scam they said they did n't receive enough documentation but I told them that I did n't receive any documentation from the vacation all I had was what I sent them. So the people from Capital One called the vacation place, XXXX with me on 3 way she then told them that she knew this was a scam and that I need to get my money back they told her no they freaked out on her and hung the phone up on her Capital One has all that on recording and they still do n't want to pay me my money back. They told me they have to follow procedures but how can they follow procedures when they clearly heard that it was scam them self. Please do n't ever try to get a vacation package through American vacations and also be careful what Capital One tells you because they do n't really back you up"
Capital One,"On or about XXXX 2015, I was going through a divorce and had to change my bank account on my automatic payment service on my Capital One credit card. I changed the bank account number and am positive that once I changed the account number that I re enrolled in the automatic payment to deduct the minimum payment due for each month. Two months later, I receive a call from Capital One saying that I have been 60 days late on my payment. I was shocked as I know that I set up automatic payments with Capital One, as I do with all of my credit cards. The representative said that my automatic payment was not enrolled. 

Fast forward to this month, I am applying for a mortgage for a new home. My lender says that there is derogatory items on my report. XXXX late payments totaling in a 60 day late on my credit report on XXXX and XXXX 2015 from Capital One. 

I called Capital One and explained the situation but they are telling me that the information is accurate and they are obligated to report to the Credit Reporting Agencies ( XXXX ). 

Because of Capital One 's negligence or glitch in their system my credit score has dropped significantly and now am unable to get an excellent mortgage rate to purchase my new home. 

I 've never missed a late payment with any of my credit cards. 

This is a mistake on Capital One 's part and I should not have to be inconvenienced by their mistake or glitch in their system, as I DID re enroll in the automatic payment thru their website. I 've had credit cards and car loans through Capital One and for them to not rectify this problem is absurd."
Capital One,"Dear, My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, I had XXXX USD master credit card transaction with the XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2016, which is an unlicensed binary option brokers. 
XXXX XXXX who is from XXXX contacted to trade for XXXX. I lost everything. 
So, I had opened the dispute for the charge back from the XXXXCredit XXXX ( Capitalone ) against the XXXX. 
The reason is that merchant is failed to performance service described according to master card charge back code XXXX. 
I provided all of XXXX Chat Script and the script are showed how I lost my money. But XXXX said the chat script can not be used the evidence, and they closed my dispute. 
I would like to reopen the dispute and get the money back from the XXXX XXXX."
Capital One,"I had a XXXX master card. I got this card initially in XXXX and it was serviced by XXXX. XXXX sold their XXXX XXXX master card portfolio to Capital One in the beginning of XXXX ( I think? ), then in XXXX this XXXX portfolio was purchased again by XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. The problem I am encountering is actually submitting the credit dispute with Capital One, because they do n't have my information and when I call the current servicer/owner of the XXXX portfolio, XXXX, they tell me they can not help me because the account was transferred to them in a "" closed '' status and because capital one is the one reporting me I have to dispute it with them. They advised me that Capital One did n't send all the information they should have when they obtained the portfolio. They can give me general information, but not any information for me I need. I asked them if they could send me my statements from when Capital One serviced the account because when the card was opened I got statements from capital one electronically which was just an email from them saying, '' hey just log in online. '' Which helps me zero. All of those emails I got wont help because I cant access the links included in them because again the portfolio was sold. 
Honestly this is not fair, because my credit is being impacted and I am trying to prepare to purchase a home. 
I am trying to dispute XXXX, XXXX and XXXX reporting from Capital One for this card. They reported to the bureaus that I was late 30 days for XXXX, and 60 days past due for XXXX and XXXX. This was all caused because of an annual fee. This annual fee of roughly around {$50.00} reopened the XXXX capital one account AFTER it was supposed to closed. 
This was a system error that Capital One eventually took ownership of and they credited back the charge and closed the account. This happened in XXXX but the reporting to the bureaus remained. Which is XXXX item I wanted to dispute. 
I also wanted to dispute the account reporting in XXXX of XXXX. Which on my report shows that it was 90 days delinquent. Again this was NOT correct and is relevant to the above XXXX to XXXX dispute because Capital One sold and transferred the account in XXXX to a collection agency. Whom I paid in full. 
The problem with that is that i have confirmation emails of making payments in XXXX, through XXXX. So how could I be 90 days past due? Why was I ever transferred to a collection agency in XXXX after making monthly payments each month? 
Thankfully I signed up for automatic emails during this time confirming my payments each month but the sheer lack of process from both XXXX and Capital One to get this process finished has honestly been nothing but frustrating. RESPA prevents this from happening in mortgage servicing, but apparently if a credit cards are purchased between banks or financial institutions it does n't matter how the consumer is treated. 
I will attach the payment emails I have received in XXXX for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. and the credit report I disputed. XXXX was able to remove similar occurrences that happened in XXXX. When XXXX transferred the XXXX XXXX portfolio to Capital One."
Capital One,"A company advertising as XXXX online trial for skin cream. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I ordered the trial. I careful looked to see if there was any recurring charges on this ad as this XXXX becoming an epidemic when ordering products none was shown. I ordered the product and my charge was billed for the trial of XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I noticed a charge on my credit card for XXXX. I had not authorized any charge and called my credit card company. I was told that it showed preauthorized and asked to call the number on the charge receipt. I did so and it was an overseas company. The representative indicated that I had ordered the trial and by doing so I agreed to recurring charges. I shared that no such language was on the original order site nor was it on the emails confirming the shipment. I was told it would be canceled. The company showed the cancellation was made as of XXXX/XXXX/16, however I called on XXXX/XXXX/16 and then called back on XXXX/XXXX/16 as I had not received a confirmation of the cancellation. I was told I would receive this and to date it still has not been issued. I am submitting this to CFPB due to the fact that this company, though they show my cancellation still expects to get paid for a product that was never shipped other than a trial. I disputed the subsequent charge to my credit card company in XXXX and on XXXX XXXX received some documents from a different company about an agreement for recurring order on a different product. The company changed its name & product. I ordered XXXX, which is on my original order receipt and a company called XXXX XXXX responded to my credit card company. I never order anything from XXXX and never agreed to any type of recurring shipping of the product nor did I receive any subsequent order of the product. I believe this company should be investigated for fraudulent advertising and charging consumers."
Capital One,"Requested a validation of all account level information, and the company can not provide this information. They have not been able to provide any of the requested information and have made no attempt to provide the information to me. I have an increasing balance and charges on a closed account that are not explainable as well as other issues as being requested in the entire validation of the entire account from opening."
Capital One,"I requested a credit line increase, the reason why I did n't get one was, "" We are unable to obtain your most recent monthly payment data from the credit reporting agency. '' Very unlikely reason since every time the wind blows, I get a alert about my credit report from them. Plus, it 's no where to be found on their reasons for denials."
Capital One,"I contacted Capital one late XXXX to complain that a credit card I had that was discharged during bankruptcy I filed during XXXX was discharged at that time. I was contacted by phone and in writing that this was an error and the item ( Capital One Credit Card charge off ) was removed from my credit card. I received notification in XXXX of XXXX that Capital one has once again "" re '' reported this to the credit reporting agencies. This has caused me to pay deposits, turned down for lower interest credit card offers and made it impossible for my borrow money to make home improvements to sell my home. See below for how these accounts have been reported to XXXX. XXXX and XXXX are reported in similar fashion based on my understanding of reports ( see below ).

Capital One,Capital One takes centuries to approve a new credit card. The agony does n't end there-almost a month since i was informed about my card being mailed to me and nobody has a clue where the credit card is.
Capital One,I applied a credit card from SAKS FIFTH AVENUE and I received the card on XXXX XXXX. I found it blocked and I made the phone call to unblock it on XXXX XXXX. I provided all the document required to verify my identification. Now it 's still under review and I can not get any estimated date. I can even not login my account online. I can also not cancel this card. It 's really stupid and the customer service just keeps saying they can not do anything while it 's under review.
Capital One,"I requested a line of credit increase from Capital One on my Secured Card. At the time I opened the my secured card account I read on the Capital One website : credit line increases would be considered either by additional deposit of funds or review by Capital One. I received an update on the Capital One Message Center stating my request was denied for the following reason : "" Unsecured credit line increases are not available upon request on Secured Card account. '' I chatted with Capital One to find out : 1. no funds maybe deposited to increase my line of credit, 2. the message I received concerning denial was not the real reason the line of credit increase was declined, 3. Capital One does not conduct periodic reviews or have a review schedule for a line of credit increase. I came away from the chat with the following : 1. additional funds may not be deposited which is contrary to advertisement, 2. inaccurate reasons for denial are provided by an account rep and communicated to the customer on the Capital One Message Center 3. The customer looking to improve their credit will not have a periodic review 4. Capital One does not have a periodic review schedule for any type of line of credit increase"
Capital One,I have not applied for a credit card of Capital One. I checked my credit report and noticed that someone had open an account under my name. I am not aware how this happened. I disputed the credit card account and it is under investigation and the issue has not been resolved.
Capital One,"On Friday XXXX/XXXX/2016 I tried to withdraw cash from an ATM with my Capital One CC to no avail. Contacted their CS XXXX # and realized I was entering wrong pin #. This was after 3 failed attempts. Then entered correct # but ATM refused to accept. The establishment we were at agreed to advance {$20.00} on a tab. I was attending a charity fundraising event and needed cash to tip performers. When I attempted to close my tab Capital One had frozen the acct for possible "" fraudulent activity. '' I then contacted CS again ; they transferred me to the Fraud Dept where I s/w XXXX at approximately XXXX A.M. After giving ALL my pertinent security info ( SSN, DOB , address/phone #, security code, etc ... ) I was then asked XXXX different security questions RE addresses I have been associated with -- -some I 've not lived at in over XXXX years including my grandparent 's address where I never lived! The Fraud CSR, XXXX had an apparent XXXX accent and was difficult to understand. Due to my XXXX, XXXX, we had the entire conversation on speaker phone. My roommate/caretaker was talking on my behalf. This created deep concern on XXXX part ; to say the least her accent, my roommate 's impatience and mutual confusion caused the situation to escalate. XXXX informed me that, despite following every security procedure successfully, I would now be required to submit my ID via email link/fax to further verify my identity. 
To say the least it was HIGHLY EMBARRASSING & DEHUMANIZING to deal with all of this and NOT be able to pay my bill! Earlier in the month, XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, I had made two {$100.00} payments - XXXX of my monthly XXXX limited income. To say the least money was on the acct and I 've done my best to be a responsible customer. 
Within one hour of receiving the email link I submitted a scanned copy of my XXXX state ID. I immediately called CS & s/w XXXX, a senior Fraud Dept Mgr, at XXXX He verified that my emailed copy of ID was received. However, it would take 72 business hours for the ID to be verified before a decision could be taken to resolve the blocked CC. I expressed my DEEP FRUSTRATION & ANGER and this was completely unacceptable. 
On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I called Capital One CS Dept again. At XXXX I s/w XXXX and expl 'd the entire previous night 's events and that I demanded immediate resolution since EVERY security precaution had been followed and request for info/documentation had been complied with. I was then transferred to Senior Fraud Dept Mgr XXXX at XXXX Once again I relayed the entire previous XXXX hours events, demanding immediate resolution. He graciously explained regret but that their system could not be circumvented by any human and I 'd have to wait the XXXX business hours for any resolution. 
Today, Monday XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One corporate HQ in XXXX and demanded to s/w CEO XXXX XXXX or his administrative assistant. I was transferred to their Executive Consumer Resolution Dept in XXXX where I s/w XXXX at XXXX CST. Once again I relayed the whole story. She was very gracious, empathetic and patient. XXXX explained that this event would be "" red flagged '' but could take up to 3-5 days before I might receive a call back. 
In the meantime I 'm still unable to access MY funds while needing to obtain Rxs and pet food for my animals. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!! I 've followed EVERY security procedure and identity verification!!! IT 'S SAD AND DEPLORABLE when there is no procedure in place for human beings to override computerized systems in a verifiable special circumstance when the consumer meets EVERY requirement and is still punished for no fault of his/her own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Capital One,"I am an authorized user on my ex-husband 's XXXX credit cards, XXXX with XXXX and XXXX with Capital One. He has called each of these companies and asked that they remove me as an authorized user multiple times since XXXX, each time they assured him that I would be removed. I refinanced my truck in XXXX XXXX and they told me his accounts were still showing on my credit report. My credit score was XXXX at that time. I never applied for any credit after that, but I pulled my free annual credit report in XXXX and saw that his accounts were still on my credit report. He called the companies again, and was assured that I 'd been removed. In XXXX XXXX I applied for a mortgage loan and discovered that his accounts were still on my credit report, and by then my credit score had dropped from a XXXX to a XXXX. He called the companies again, and was assured that I 'd been removed. Now I just re-applied for a mortgage loan and discovered that his cards are still on my credit report, showing me as an authorized user, and because my ex-husband has gone over the credit limit on XXXX of the cards and has a past due payment on XXXX of them, and has over 30 days delinquency on the other card, all of those factors have negatively impacted my credit score significantly. My credit score has gone down from XXXX in XXXX XXXX to now a XXXX in XXXX XXXX. I do not have any negative items on any of my accounts that I have ever had in my life, or on any of my current accounts. I have never had a late payment, over credit limit, nothing negative whatsoever, my credit was impeccable. And now, because these companies have repeatedly ignored our requests to remove me from his cards as an authorized user, my credit score has dropped significantly and now I ca n't get a home loan. I want XXXX and Capital One to remove me as an authorized user immediately and I want them to restore my credit score back to where it should be."
Capital One,"I setup autopays with Capital One. My monthly minimum payment was usually at XXXX per month. I checked my account today and they had a payment in the amount of XXXX pending to be withdrawn from my account. I called them immediately and asked why such a large payment? After sitting on hold for 5 minutes they came back and stated that I requested a payment on top of my autopay. Well of course I did n't do that and if I was stupid enough to do that then would n't there be multiple transactions? I informed them that the funds would not be available, that they would have to stop that transaction. I was of course informed that they could not and that if I stopped the payment through my bank I would be charged a late fee but if I could pay XXXX right now then there would n't be. They said that was my minimum payment so again why XXXX? I informed them that I would not pay them XXXX right now and that I am going to stop the payment, in which I did my bank informed the payment is n't even pending yet but charged me XXXX to make sure the XXXX does n't get processed. Capital One automatically restricted my card use. I have no problem paying my minimum payment but I feel that the XXXX was being withdrawn unlawfully and then they tried to strong arm me by giving me a late fee, raising my interest and restricting my card. I will not pay this card until all charges are refunded and a honest reason of why they tried to charge me XXXX is given"
Capital One,"I just lost my job and now I have time and wanted to consolidate my bills, call the credit card companies and set up payment plans. I called this number XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/16 at XXXX. A man answered me and asked for an account number which I could not give. He said something about it had to be transferred to customer service, then there was dead air. I said 'hello ', 'hello ' and no one answered, I got nervous so I hung up. I did not bother calling back. I did call CFPB as I wanted to make sure that what I was doing was right. I spoke to a very kind lady who gave me good advise and gave me a number to non-profit financial advisors should I wish to seek advise/guidance. 

At around XXXX, and my aunt sent me a message asking me to give her a call once I got to Pa. 

I called my aunt once I was in Pa and she told me that there was a court summons, the neighbor called my uncle because the neighbor did not want to sign the court summons addressed to me. 

I guess someone signed for it as my Aunt had the copy of the summons. I feel that my privacy was violated. It seemed fishy to me that I gave them a call, someone answered, there was dead air and suddenly someone showed up with a court summons dated XXXX XXXX, 2016."
Capital One,"I returned an item to XXXX, but they did not credit my account. I sent documentation and letters to Capital One indicating proof of lack of indebtedness but they claim I have not. I received a small claims judgement against XXXX, but Capital One refused to credit my account."
Capital One,"The fraud department has had our business credit card accounts on hold for several weeks now due to payments they want to verify. Although we disagree with the fraud hold initially, we understand the need for security. What we do not understand is why the fraud hold has not been released almost 30 days after the payments were made. 

The fraud department has indicated that they want to verify the payments in question by calling the banks that the payments came from. Unfortunately, XXXX of the institutions do not disclose any information about customer accounts over the phone. The capital one fraud department needs to find a better way to verify payments, and absolutely should have a means of automatically removing security holds after several weeks. In any case, I have attached statements to this complaint, and highlighted the payments showing that they have cleared. I have also attached photo ids of the account holders."
Capital One,"I had XXXX XXXX call me at home ( cold calls ) and offer insurance policies as I was not insured and I had been looking on the Federal Exchange. I asked specifically if they covered the doctors I was using as I am XXXX now and they said they "" looked it up '' and answered absolutely YES. The insurance companies were from out of state. When I tried to tell this to Capital One the card I had charged the premiums to they said the companies submitted all their paperwork where I had signed up, although I never received anything from any of these companies. They told me not to use the policy for 30 days and directed me to a website to print up a temporary insurance card, nothing else. The card is refusing to credit me for the money I spent on these policies they blatantly lied about. I am XXXX and have no income. I believe they sold policies on fraudulent premises, lies. I have written several letters to Capital One explaining this to no avail. Capital One is siding with the insurance companies. I called and cancelled these policies within the required 30 day period which now the insurance companies are denying. I got no paperwork or confirmation numbers when I cancelled these policies which is what Capital One is asking for. Which is why I am guessing they did n't want me to file any claims for 30 days."
Capital One,"This bank voluntarily undertook to lend me money but the lending was not accomplished with due care and increased the risk of harm to me through ( 1 ) an inability to access the proper amount of funds to properly grow my business of providing legal services particularly on or about XXXX XXXX, XXXX which is when I filed for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy ( which was dismissed ) and after the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Supreme Court order of suspension from the practice of law ( which I am challenging ) but at which time a proper amount of loan funds would have allowed me to redirect my law practice to potential customers in XXXX and XXXX ( as my law licenses in XXXX and XXXX is valid ) as well as ( 2 ) through the negative mark on my credit reports and presumably resulted in harm to others who would have benefited from my business of providing legal services ( or at least the lower cost of legal services gained by more competition in the marketplace ).

Capital One,"Capital One Venture card telephoned to say my card was blocked but, other than to say there was an indication of possible attempted use by unauthorized user would not provide any information. I verified all outstanding charges. They still demanded I send them a photocopy of my Social Security card, proof of identity and proof of my address, and they would not accept telephone or on-online verification of my identity. I ( perhaps foolishly ) sent them copies of my Social Security card, passport and utility bill showing my address -- so now they are in a position to participate in identity theft should they not be completely honest. Nonetheless my account remains "" restricted '' meaning I can not use the card or get any information from them online. I have filed an online complaint with Capital One and not received any response. Attempts to contact them by telephone result in very lengthy delays on hold and then a refusal by staff to provide any information or assistance, only evasiveness even when I speak with a supervisor. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I wrote to them to close the account and credit the small rewards balance I have earned against the small outstanding balance on the account. Obviously it is too soon to have received a response."
Capital One,"The company, Kohl 's Dept Store NY is contacting my cell phone ( my cell # XXXX ) everyday at 10 times per, calling me after XXXX ... They use several phone numbers as follows : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX,"
Capital One,"I have been a customer of Capital One for a few years now and have XXXX credit cards with them. Over the last year and a half, I have requested credit limit increases on both cards and have been denied. XXXX was receiving a message of denial stating that my payments were XXXX small. I increased the payment amounts and started receiving the following denial of credit message : "" A credit limit increase is currently not available upon request because Capital One is evaluating account activity at assigned credit limits. '' I have been receiving that message for 8 months now. Additionally, my other card has been receiving the same denial message for 15 months now. This message implies that an evaluation is being performed on the account and that at some point there will either be an increase or a reason for denial based on this evaluation. The fact that these messages started showing up after I increased the payment amount are not a coincidence. I feel that Capital One does not want to provide a legitimate reason for denial and do not have a concrete reason. The evaluation period seems to have no end. So, I contacted their customer service and their customer service was no help. All they were able to do is state that currently they are reviewing the credit limit increase policy. However, the letter does not state that they are reviewing policy ... it states that they are reviewing my account activity. So, either the letter itself is not factual or the customer service representative lied to me. I simply wanted to know when the evaluation period would end or if they could provide me with a concrete reason. I believe this is a violation of regulation B and the FCRA as I do not feel like they are providing me with sufficient reasoning for the denial of credit. I will be attaching a copy of the most recent letter I received - although they are all the same. Additionally, I am attaching the conversation I had with the customer service from Capital One."
Capital One,"I had my card shut off and contacted the company. I was told my payments would only be {$55.00} a month and had been paying roughly $ 75 monthly just to help pay a little extra. I started getting letters saying my payment was falling behind and that my minimum payment was {$140.00} which was not the agreement. I then tried several times to contact Capital One and when I spoke to customer service, they were very disrespecful and accused me of lying to them and giving false information. I was told the account number I was providing is not in the system yet I keep getting letters saying I 'm behind on my payments with that account number. I contacted the complaint department that is listed with the company on this site just to receive XXXX messages to call them. I since have called numerous times and never can reach anyone. I have even left a message asking to call me back with no such luck. And now its going against my credit. I have filed with the XXXX and they did n't really help and said with no documentation they could n't do anything even though everything was on a recorded line. 

I have since been in constant contact with Capital one attempting to do everything on my part to get the issue resolved. I have the names, dates and times of everyone I have spoken with. XXXX XXXX ( spelling? ) Is who I have XXXX been in the most contact with. After a month and a half of calls back and forth and being told to make payments he later told me that no matter what I pay my balance would increase and there is nothing they will do to help. 

Also on the photo I uploaded. It only shows online payments made and will not show payments mailed in or made over the phone."
Capital One,"Hi, I made a payment to my credit card in the amount of {$3700.00} and an other of {$100.00} ( the full statement balance ). These payments were made on Friday XXXX XXXX 2016. My husband two hours later made a payment of {$240.00} to his credit card ( the full statement balance ). All payments were paid by my external XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on Monday XXXX XXXX 2016. My husbands credit card was paid and the balance currently is showing {$0.00} and a full credit line. However, my credit card is reflecting {$67.00} available credit, this even after being charged {$51.00} in interest. 

Today I had my husband call Capital One to find out why his Capital One account would have money applied accurately and timely and mine was not. He spoke with a "" Supervisor XXXX '' who 's Agent ID was identified as XXXX. She indicated that she did not know why, but that Capital One 's policy is that they can hold money for four ( 4 ) days. XXXX could not identify what indicators would trigger this business practice. XXXX also indicated that Capital One has reported to the Credit Bureaus that my current balance is {$180.00}. My husband voiced his concerns that this policy is an unfair and deceptive business practice when applied arbitrarily without rhythm or reason nor justification. My account has never been paid late, considered a slow pay account or otherwise given any trigger that I am not an honest, credit worthy, credit responsible customer. XXXX 's response was she was following Capital One policy ; or politely saying she did n't care nor does Capital One! 

My concerns are, Capital One holding funds, then charging interest though the statement balance was paid in full, is not only unfair but deceptive. Capital One reporting to the credit bureaus that payments were made in the amount of {$3800.00} but an available credit of {$51.00} could impact my debt to income ratio and lead to potential lenders in their underwriting processing questioning my credit worthiness. This is not only deceptive but unfair. Is this because I am female and do not make the income of my spouse or my male counterparts at Capital One? Do they enforce these same practices with their own employees or executives? They did not with my husband! Last, when asked to speak to XXXX 's supervisor or to someone on Capital One 's Corporate Escalation Team, she refused. XXXX 's actions demonstrated that she did not care about my issues or in resolving my concerns. I 'm very disappointed with Capital One and their poor customer service.

Capital One,"Dear Consumer Representative : Capital One Bank is sending me pre-approved application for a credit card. I 'm getting the mailings on a weekly bassis, mean while everytime I 'm being denied a credit card. Also, the director is mailing me a personal letter and never approve. I would like to know what is going on and get approved.

Capital One,"I spoke with a company called XXXX and explained that I could n't afford to make a payment on my Capitol one account that day but I would call back on XXXX/XXXX/16 and set up payment arrangements on the account. I am not sure of the date that I spoke to them about the payments but I believe it was around XXXX/XXXX/2016. 
Today I recieved a phone call from a relative that I have n't spoken to for two years saying she spoke to someone from the same company who told her that I was in default on my Capitol one credit card. They gave her my balance, told her that they spoke with me about my account and that I told them I would call back to make payment arrangements and never called them back. They gave her a date that they spoke with me and everything!! Now that relative has told my whole family that I can not pay my bills and is dragging my name through the mud. I called XXXX agency and spoke with a manager named XXXX and he told me he would look into listening to the call and apologized for what happened. After speaking to him I decided to call back and make a request to hear the call, and XXXX stated that he did n't believe there was a way to do that. I have contacted my lawyer because I believe my FDCPA rights have been violated."
Capital One,"I am unable to actually pay my bill, or my balance on the card that I have with Capital One. I got this card XX/XX/XXXX, and I have had several issues regarding Customer Service. As well as with the Fraud Department. I have verified everything I have ever needed to verify. As well as went back and forth between the corporate people at Capital One, and the Fraud Department. I have had to stop payments from going through to their company, because they absolutely refuse to offer a solution for this issue, or any of the other MAJOR issues I have had with this company. I can no longer speak to the corporate office, because they tell me my issue is a, "" Fraud Issue ''. This situation has been going on for months, with no end in sight. My account is currently restricted, and the reason/reasons it is currently restricted ( even though proof has been given, as well as many phone calls have been made by my bank to this company ) they are not willing to budge in any way. Even after doing what was asked. I am always told a different story, and I am always connected from corporate to the Fraud Department. I have had nothing but issues with this company, and this card since I opened it. I get plenty of notifications that my bill is due, but why pay the bill when Capital One does n't even know what they are doing? As well as moving me back and forth between rude, and disrespectful people. They have caused nothing but hurdles for me. With NO-WAY to take care of these issues. All I end up with after I have spent almost 2-3 hours on the phone with these people is a pathetic apology. I need to speak with someone that can handle these issues without me being transferred all over the place. I refuse to speak to any more rude/disrespectful Customer Service OR Fraud Department people at Capital One. The past few conversations I have had with Capital One I have had people laugh at me in a mean way. I 've also had people yell at me, along with insult me. I have made several attempts, ( So has my bank ) to clear these issues up."
Capital One,"Capital One ( XXXX ) called my cell phone and home phone several times since XXXX XXXX, 2016 looking for a relative with a credit card situation. I do not and have not done business with Capital One and want the calls stopped. I consider this to be harassment.

Capital One,"capital one is hitting me with a 30 day late on my credit report. 

between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX i had setup automatic payments via their website. the payments were supposed to come out of my account on the XXXX of every month. for some reason capital one never withdrew the money from my account. 

Capital one didnt contact me via phone until i was 36 days late. i immediately paid the balance owed. 

now i have a 30 day late on my credit report if capital one system would hav eworked correctly or they had contacted me prior to the 30 days, this would not be an issue i dont think my credit should be stained because capital one system didnt work properly. 

at this point capital one has told me there is nothing they can do. i know this to be false. 

i havent been late on this or any other card in the last 7 years."
Capital One,A credit card I had not requested supplied incorrect address to credit bureaus.
Capital One,"My credit score randomly dropped XXXX points after a dispute was resolved in MY favor for a credit account of mine. I called XXXX to inquire about why my score had dropped so drastically, only to be transferred at least 5 times and have each representative give me their "" bogus '' version of what may have happened. FINALLY the last representative informed me that my credit card account ( whose dispute was just resolved ) was now showing up as a REAL ESTATE account instead of a CREDIT/CHARGE account. When I asked if the error could be fixed since was in the underwriting stage of getting a home, they refused and told me to take it up with the creditor. I am extremely upset and still filed the dispute with both XXXX and the creditor. I did not have this issue on any other credit report and now I am out of my dream house because of this inaccurate info that I STILL have n't heard anything back about. Simple and obvious errors SHOULD NOT take 60-90 days to correct and I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with the customer service that was provided as the majority of the individuals that I spoke with on the phone lacked both knowledge about the reporting process itself as well as the ability to understand their customer 's concerns."
Capital One,"I have a Capital One card with a 25.1 % interest rate, but it was higher than that for years. I have been calling for years to lower that rate but they never help me. I ca n't seem to get it down, and I am only working part time XXXX. I was laid off my full time job a year ago and I just want to get rid of that card. I also have another card with them and have always paid on time, and more than the minimum payment.. They just tell me to keep calling back and I do call back and get no results.."
Capital One,I opened a credit card account with Capital One in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX XXXX is reporting that I opened it in XXXX. This account should be taken off my credit report as it has been over 7 years.
Capital One,"I have very high interest on my credit cards and when calling the companies they never will lower my interest rate, yet when I call XXXX they can get lower interest rates. Why are these not available to the Consumer through the credit card companies rather than having to go through a Debt relief. I am paying all of my bills on time however the interest rates are so high I ca n't get them paid down. Every time I call, the companies say there is n't anything available. Why ca n't they offer a lower interest rate to consumers rather than having to go through a debit relief company which I do n't want to do. These rates were all raised in 2009 before Obama said no rate increases in interest. I was involved in Hurricane XXXX at that time evacuated to another location for XXXX months and was still receiving my mail XXXX.so I missed some of the offers to not increase the interest rate. I feel that the consumer is not being treated fairly with not offering the consumer similar lower interest rates that a debt relief company can offer. Please help with this issue."
Capital One,"I have a Capital One Visa card, to which I have several automatic payments attached. Within the last couple years, I had to close the account ( get a new account number ) once when my son lost his card and then again when Capital One changed to chip cards. Changing account numbers is a real hassle for the consumer who has payments tied to the card. 

Several times the fraud department has declined transactions, even though they were n't fraudulent. Typically, I could respond to a text or email and retry the transaction, but this is n't very convenient if others are waiting in line behind you at a store ( especially at a grocery store checkout, for example ). 

Yesterday was the last straw with me. I received a call from the fraud department regarding some small charges, none of which were fraudulent. In fact, one of the charges they asked me about was a regular monthly charge that has appeared on my account for over a year. Apparently, their computer program "" suspected '' that there was a fraud problem, and they insisted on closing the account. I spoke with a supervisor in the fraud department and told her that I did n't want my account number changed yet again, especially since it was a chip card ( supposedly more secure ) and there were no fraudulent charges. She just gave me the spiel about the computer suspecting something and insisted on closing the account. I asked to speak with her boss, and she told me she does n't report to anyone, which I find very hard to believe. So I told her I 'm done with Capital One. Apparently, they do n't care about losing business. 

Questions : Can they close my account against my will even though there were n't any fraudulent charges? Are there any credit card issuers whose fraud departments are more reasonable to deal with?"
Capital One,"The following inquires are on my credit report and I did NOT give approval or permission to run my credit. I 've sent letter to the creditors and the Bureaus and have not heard back from them. These inquires needs to be REMOVED.

Capital One,I had XXXX credit cards with Capital One at an introductory rate of 12.99 %. I have had them for several years but I recently paid them off and kept receiving bills for interest charges at a rate of 25.93 %. They would not reduce my rate below 20 % and said they could not lower it below the introductory rate. When they checked the introductory rate they told me it was 22 % which can not be true as I do n't use credit cards that often and certainly am not going to pay that kind of interest. I believe Capital One is being unfair in their interest rate practices. I paid these cards in a timely manner and always paid more than the minimum due? Changing interest rates at random should not be allowed. They do n't put a note on your bill telling you your interest rate has changed. They just change it. With the prime rate being low these credit card companies should not be allowed to charge this kind of interest. I have paid and cancelled these cards. They will no longer be able to rake me over the coals with their high interest rates.
Capital One,"For my monthly statement with the due date XXXX/XXXX/2016 ( XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX ), the new balance was {$3000.00}. However, Capital One then reported my balance being {$3100.00} without notice and added a {$59.00} membership fee also without notice, seemingly attempting to put my card greatly over the limit, which brought my credit score down from XXXX to XXXX within the FICO reporting months of XXXX 2016 to XXXX 2016. I have paid {$100.00} and the minimum was {$97.00}. These are unfair practices by Capital One. The should at least warn me when they will add a membership fee."
Capital One,"I am a XXXX American XXXX veteran. I have been a customer with Capital One for years. I was hospitalized from XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I was in XXXX at the VA Hospital. A merchant charged me for a service billing my credit card XXXX. I did n't approve this charge. Even though this merchant House Detectives did n't have any signed invoice by me, Capital One charged me. They did n't consider the fact that I was hospitalized at this time in XXXX and my doctor said due to my condition at that time I should n't be responsible for any financial obligations."
Capital One,"I went through a credit consolidation company to reduce my debts, the program was to be be completed XX/XX/XXXX. Instead of closing my account with Capitol One, Capitol one took the payments that were issued to the agreed account, after it had a XXXX balance and applied them to my other card. The card that had payments placed to it was not in the consolidation and caused my account with the consolidation company to remain open, where I incurred service fees monthly. At no time was there any arrangement to pay on any other account, only the 1 that was listed in the consolidation contract. I feel strongly that this was a breech of contract with Cap.One and highly illegal. At no time did I approve my payments to go to any other account. The accounts, including one in my wifes name, were receiving payments. The consolidation loan was only in my name, so not only did Cap. One make payments that were directed to accounts not in the consolidation agreement they applied money to an account that was n't in my name. I have contacted cap one and their response was it is in their practice to take over payments and apply them to other cards. ABSOLUTELY NOT! That can not be legal. A consolidation company works with the debtors to drop interest and reduce the payments, the open accounts had not been included in this. Had this account been paid off my consolidation payments would have finished XX/XX/XXXX for all the companies in my debt consolidation. being that it was not, I had several months where my payments were being divided between Cap one and a separate debt. So not only did I pay out XXXX months of unnecessary service fees it lengthened my pay off to the other account."
Capital One,"Well Capitalone is doing it to me again. The card that was originally issued through them has an interest rate of 22.9 %. They increased this card limit to XXXX dollars on XX/XX/XXXX. They then increased the limit on this card to XXXX dollars on XX/XX/XXXX. That is a span in time of about a year and a half. Keep in mind I started out at a XXXX dollar limit on this card. I have never had one late payment and I pay way more then the minimum every month. Although I am sure they wish I did n't because they would make more money in interest off of me. The other card which was first issued by Orchard Bank was bought out by them and had an interest rate of 14.9 %. They bought the card and knew what the interest rate was. I am still at a limit of 2000 dollars on that card. I keep it up towards the maximum because the interest rate is cheaper saving me money. I have never been late on this card either with payments and again have paid way more then then the minimum payment each month. The limit was raised to 2000 dollars on XX/XX/XXXX only because I filed a complaint with you at that time. At the time of that complaint they had me at XXXX dollar limit. My complaint is the same again today. They hold me back on the credit limit of this card because they make more money off of me on interest on the other card. My credit is good and my payment history is good. It is now XX/XX/XXXX roughly a year and a half on this card also now. I feel they should reimburse me some interest from the other card and increase my credit limit to at least XXXX dollars. You know in this day and age there are a lot of balance transfer offers with 0 % interest, some for a year, some for more time. I am really thinking about doing that if they do n't stop doing this to me. I am giving them the benefit of the doubt like they gave me after my bankruptcy. I am not unappreciative I just feel like I 'm being ripped off again. Please help."
Capital One,"Acquired a Capitol One Venture Card for trip to XXXX 6 or so weeks before the travel. 
When the cards arrived we called to inform them of the specifics of our travel, and requested a pin number which arrived by mail shortly. We called to change the numbers ( I believe this was automated ). 
On arrival in XXXX, we could not get cash with our pins. We did get one or two uses of the card, and then it was blocked. No call was received as is usual on our cell phone, nor on our home number when I had a relative check. As we had a back-up card and bank debit card, we switched to that use rather than incur the cost of phone calls to Capitol One. Calling today, Capitol One did not have the travel times, nor the cell number and claimed our home number was out of service ( a relative was here ). 
So, consumer beware.

I have also requested to have all complete account information, including the original account applications to be forwarded to me.

Capital One,"Thought card was on autopayment, it was not. I attempted to submit payments online through Capital One 's website and thought everything was good. I 've paid on time with Capital One ever since I opened my account. They sure were quick to report me as 30 days late on all credit bureaus. I contacted them and they told me they can not do anything. I contacted all XXXX credit bureaus and they informed me to contact Capital One. I 'm stuck in this endless loop. I understand that they do n't have to make any adjustments. But, I believe their website had issues and I do n't understand why they are so adamant about not helping me."

Contacted Capital One again, and now in the period of the last 3 days they have changed the date my funds would be available from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and now XX/XX/XXXX. They flat out lied to me, and then tried to cover it up. They claim that funds are held "" At random '' but this occurs on my account every single month.

Capital One,Capital One continues to report business account and further states that I am personally liable for charges. No information supplied by Capital One to substantiate account ownership
Capital One,My Capital One card initially called to assist me with payment so that I could avoid being late on the payment and mislead me and it keeps reporting the late payment. I had contacted them numerously about this and they refuse to rectify the bad reporting to the credit bureaus.
Capital One,I applied for a business credit card with Capital One. Capital One ran my credit ( score of XXXX ; see attached ). I have a fraud alert on my credit report so Capital One was supposed to call me and ask me questions about my report to verify my identity. Capital One never called me at the number provided. I received a letter from Capital One dated XXXX XXXX ( attached ) stating that they were unable to reach me concerning the fraud alert.

Capital One,"We purchased a ring from Helzberg Diamonds for my wife on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and opened a credit card account that night with Capital One to save 10 % on the purchase. Helzberg did not give us a 10 % discount but rather a 5 % and 5 %. After the sale we turned around and wrote a check to have a zero balance on the credit card. It was a beautiful ring but unfortunately we took it back because the stone was not changing colors ( XXXX ). I received my money back immediately that was paid from a debit card. I called Capital One when I received the credit card in the mail and canceled the account. I received a letter in the mail dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 stating that the credit card account was closed. I was also told that I should receive the money back we paid from using the credit card within 10 days. I have called several times because the check was not in the mail and I was told each time it was. I also received a billing statement from Capital One that was dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 which shows a credit on the account. Finally on XXXX XXXX, 2016 I spoke with a manager and Capital One who informed me that my check would be overnighted and would arrive on XXXX XXXX, 2016 due to XXXX. I told her that would be fine. I check the mail today and still no check from Capital One. I called and spoke with a different manager today and she told me that the check was not even in the mail. It has been 27 days since the ring was returned and I still do not know when I will receive my money back from Capital One. My wife and I will never make a purchase at Helzberg Diamonds again. We will also never use a credit card that has anything to do with Capital One."
Capital One,"On a visit to a nightclub in XXXX, XXXX several unauthorized charges totalling over {$9000.00} USD were incurred on my credit card - I also lost the card that night and reported it as lost to Capital One the following morning. 

I initially filed a fraud claim for the unauthorized charges, but that was declined because as I was physically at the club for part of the night - they then transferred this to the dispute department and that was also declined as the merchant claimed the actual receipt copies I provided were not from their establishment, but those are the only receipts the merchant provided to me and these are the charges I was expecting to pay for. 

The interesting thing is the timestamp of the receipts I provided are around the same time the other fraudulent charges were incurred so do n't understand how I could be in XXXX places at once. 

Additionally, I did some internet research and found out that this merchant has been involved in several other credit card fraud complaints - I also provided this information to Capital One, but that was not taken into consideration. 

One of the fraudulent charges is for {$5000.00} and another is for {$2500.00} - these are quite huge amounts and yet I did not receive any alert or phone call from Capital One to indicate a possible fraudulent transaction or get confirmation on whether I approve the charges .... However, I was in a bad part of XXXX once and made a {$35.00} purchase and that triggered a call about a possible fraudulent charge. 

I have not made any payments for any of the amounts claimed by this merchant and I have stopped using this credit card - please let me know what options are available as this is grossly unfair and seems Capital One does not care about my side, but I do feel they should bear some responsibility for not alerting me before authorizing such huge charges, especially in a foreign country."
Capital One,"Capital One Credit only accepts payments up until XXXX EST to be credited for the same business day or face a late fee. If you live on the west coast you have 3 hours less to pay and may be subject to a late payment as a result. Not everyone lives on the East Coast. It seems plainly unfair that people living in one part of the country should be given an advantage over others, just based on where they choose to live."
Capital One,"I have been trying since XXXX/XXXX/2015 to communicate with Capitol One regarding a payment plan to stop collection efforts and make regular payments towards the amount owed. Since then, they have continued collection efforts, as well as charged-off the account, and worst have put my boyfriend in the line of fire with his credit as well. He was to be only a USER on the account, and has NEVER agreed to be on the card as a co-borrower. No contract has ever been signed by him. Therefore, both my credit and his are currently being destroyed by this XXXX company. I have made many efforts to contact them ( see attached ), to when they only respond with a letter ( see attached ) that says to call them and that they can not respond in writing. I refuse to call until I know my rights and my boyfriends rights are being upheld by the company - and currently, they are not."
Capital One,I am upset with Capital One credit card company regarding my account. They are charging me outrageous interest charges. They are charging unlawful service charges. I am really upset because they believed a casino ATM withdrawals that I was charges and they believed the casino and not my complaint I never got the ATM money the machines were are the blink and the managers of the casino told me they were having problems. You will see all the money from the XXXX XXXX on my statement. Also you can see all the charges that I have been charges in interest charges and other illegal service charges. I also am complaining that the balance should be made XXXX balance as I never asked for a credit line increase the company just added it to my account. I feel this is illegal because they did it so they could get more money from me and others.
Capital One,"I went online to choose a credit card becuase i have some travel plans coming up and need to purchase tickets now. I read and compared offers, I choose the Capital one venture card because it offered zero percent for a full year and then stated would be 12.99-22.24 % based on your credit worthiness. I was also looking at this ending score after one year. I was approved for the card right away but was given the offer of 22.24 %, my credit score XXXX, I feel it 's pretty good, maybe not the absolute best. I feel their company is providing false advertising. Many companies are trying to pull this, if after one year the ending score is over 15 % I through it away. They should n't tell people 12-22 % when they have no intention of giving that interest rate. I called them to ask if I could negotiate this rate and they told me its all computer calulated so NO!!!"
Capital One,"I got a credit card from Capital One, then due a variety of unexpected events I ended up with a higher balance than I intended. I understood when I got the card that I would have 0 % interest until XX/XX/2016, after that I would start paying interest on any balance after that time. Because of this I began pursuing other methods of paying my balance in a more manageable fashion than dealing with the oncoming high interest rates of this card. I then received an offer from Capital One regarding balance transfers. I called to ask questions about the offer and to see if it would affect my current balance. The person I talked to said the offer would n't affect my current balance, but that was irrelevant because I would never have to pay any interest on my balance anyway. This was news to me so I had him further clarify. He then told me that only purchases after XXXX XXXX would incur interest, and that any regular purchases I made before that date would not ever incur interest. I then stopped perusing other methods of paying off the balance, and made other purchases on the card. 

However, after XXXX XXXX I saw I had a substantial interest charge on my account. I called Capitol One to dispute it because I had n't made purchases on the card from XXXX XXXX onward. The person said that it was the interest on my entire balance. I explained what had been told to me during my last call and she thought I simply did n't understand what my terms were, but I made it very clear that I did understand how my card worked. I said that if they were to go back and listen to the conversation I had with the representative, they would clearly hear him explain that I would not be paying interest on regular purchases before XXXX XXXX. She said there was nothing she could do, so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager said that he would waive that interest change, then the call dropped. When I called back they said I would n't be able to speak to that manager again, but they could get another manager for me. When the new manager got on the phone she also claimed that I simply misunderstood how credit cards worked and tried to explain it. Again, I had to make it clear that I did in fact understand how it all works and that before talking to the person in my original phone call, I thought that was how my card worked. It was only after I was clearly told by this representative of Capital One, did I understand it differently. I took the representative 's word because I should be able to assume that a representative of Capitol One would have a better understanding of how my credit card works that I do. If I was in fact mislead by your company, I, the victim, should not be the one responsible for that mistake. She said she understood I had been misinformed by the company, but that the only thing she could do at this point would be to take off the single interest charge, but it had already been done. She said there was no way to remove or prevent future interest charges, even if I had been mislead. I asked for the recording of the original conversation and she said they do not give the recordings to the customers. I then asked if could at least have a lower interest rate, and she said no. 

Because a representative of Capital One grossly mislead me, my original plans to pay off the balance have fallen though, I made purchases I would have never made had I still had my original understanding of my terms, I have to make much higher payments than expected, I might not even be able to make a dent on my balance because of interest charges I am now stuck with, and my plans to return to school in the fall could also fall through. They did almost nothing to correct their company 's mistake. On top of all this I was repeatedly treated like a dumb girl who does n't understand how credit cards work."
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I reviewed my credit profiles from XXXX, and discovered Capital One Bank is erroneously reporting XXXX derogatory credit card accounts on my credit report. I contacted the Capital One Bank fraud department on or about XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and spoke to a fraud account manager, XXXX, and explained that I am a victim of identity theft and that I never opened credit card accounts with Capital One Bank, and requested that this information be removed from my credit files. XXXX requested that I forward all supporting documents and said he will investigate the fraudulent activity. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I completed gathering the requested supporting documents along with a cover letter stating, "" On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I realized I may have been a victim of identity theft and immediately filed a police report at the XXXX Police Department ( copy enclosed ). 
As promised, I have also contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and obtained a copy of the claim relating to fraudulent activity on my account, specifically XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) unauthorized ( ACH ) electronic debits paid to Capital One Bank between XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( copy enclosed ). 
I have just today reached out to XXXX XXXX fraud department and initiated a claim in connection with the XXXX XXXX XXXX transaction for {$280.00}. I will advise of the outcome of their investigation and any documentation obtained as well. '' To date, Capital One Bank has failed to remove the fraudulent information from my credit files."
Capital One,"On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I made purchased a furniture set for roughly {$1000.00} on Kohls.com. This order number is XXXX. 

My formal complaint is regarding their credit card marketing and the misleading approach that they use. I had planned to use my XXXX XXXX yesterday and when I submitted all information in the ordering process a pop-up window appeared. I was on the very last submission page about to click "" submit and finalize order. '' This pop-up says, "" Apply for a Kohls charge card and you can save 20 % on this order! '' My order totaled {$920.00}. I am not XXXX to take out credit cards, but this was enough of a discount that I thought it would be a good idea. I had used a coupon code prior on the site, but it says under promotion codes you can use up to XXXX. I also looked at the fine print ON the pop-up ad and no where led me to believe I could n't use the discount especially since they already had all of my order information. I moved forward with the application process to be approved. As soon as I went back to the submission page and submitted the order I realized it had not taken 20 % off additionally. I called customer service and they told me that it was due to me having a discount already. I see this as nothing, but a misleading marketing ploy and they even agreed on the phone that it could be misleading. Even though they seemed somewhat sympathetic to me they were not willing to return my grievance of 20 % ( {$180.00} )."
Capital One,Lord and Taylor credit service is after all these years just now charging XXXX interest rates on its store credit card balance.
Capital One,"I opened a Lord and Taylor account on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I made an initial purchase in store, and was supposed to receive my card in the mail. Two months went by, and I realized that I never received the card. I called the Capital One/Lord and Taylor credit company and made a payment on the account, which I was assured was the full payment. They would not tell me my account information over the phone, and assured me that I would receive a card in the mail. Once again, this was never received, but since I had paid my account off in full, I figured that it did not matter. I just received my credit report, and it appears this account is over 180 days past due since I made my payment, and I still have not received any information about the account such as the card number or account number. In speaking with a representative over the phone, they told me that there was nothing they could do about it."
Capital One,"I purchased a Body Camera from XXXX using my Capital One Visa Card. The camera was supposed to record video and download it to my computer. The camera was able to record but I spent many hours working with XXXX Technical Support and was not able to get the video to download to my computer. I even tried using a second computer, but it would not work either. I returned the camera to XXXX but they would not issue a refund because they said there was nothing wrong with their product/service. They said the camera worked fine with their computer and there must be something wrong with my computer. I did a dispute with Capital One, but they would not return the {$1000.00} because they say XXXX told them the returned camera was damaged. I thought that using my Capital One Credit Card would insure that I would be able to get my money back if the product I bought did not work right and I returned it. Capital One will not return the {$1000.00}. I was never able to get the camera to work and I returned it to XXXX Supervisor XXXX XXXX was the last person I spoke with at Capital One regarding this matter."
Capital One,"Please look to the enclosed document to explain the rest of issue. Then came the CREDIT CARD bill from XXXX which was a month behind from the accounts and we noticed right away over {$600.00} worth of issues and let XXXX know. We told XXXX and they were suppose to look into it and get back to us. Around XXXX 2012. We had a lot of business stuff going on and other things and cause of all the issues I decided to go the SECURED route way of getting XXXX small CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARDS with {$600.00} deposit on an {$800.00} card, {$400.00} deposit on a {$600.00} card, {$200.00} deposit on a {$200.00} card and {$400.00} deposit on a {$600.00} card. {$1600.00} deposit and {$600.00} line credit from CAPITAL ONE. And we had a XXXX card {$200.00} deposit on {$300.00} credit, {$100.00} credit line from XXXX. With all the issues we were having we felt this would he a safer bet, XXXX secured cards between XXXX of us, small incriments with deposits made by us. Right from the get go there were major issues with CAPITAL ONE. Not only will me phone records show, but XXXX was witnesses on many many occassions., but anytime I made a CAPITAL ONE SECURED CARD payment it was senf from a CAPITAL ONE BANK account. Evertytime I made a payment I did it over the phone. And everytime ( 25 times or more ), CAPITAL ONE SECURED CARD confirmed the payment went through card was ready to use. In every instance, when trying to use the CAPITAL ONE card, it would not work, funds were not there, to pay bills, groceries or gas, or going out to eat and finding out your money not there. I would have to call CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD back, they would have call CAPITAL ONE BANK, so it was not only the one phone call to make my payment, but I would have to call up to three times just cause payment oddly kept falling off the card even though they said it was there. It would disappear causing extreme situations and the time consumption was ridiculous. As well, in XXXX 2012 robbery I be discussing, someone stole XXXX of our XXXX cards and tried to use it, the merchant was the one to notify us of this. And, this happened three times while we had these cards. As well, we received a CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD for a XXXX attached to my account that we never authorized. We not only never missed a payment, in fact we paid full balance each time. We ended up speaking to someone in FRAUD over the weird card showing up and the fact people were using our cards without permission and we decided to close all CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT DOWN. The headaches alone of spending 5 to 10 hours a week dealing with calling over the deposit disappearing and us being out places looking like idiots was enough in itself to close cards. At the time WE HAD NO MONEY OWED ON CARD, we put {$1400.00} secured down on {$1800.00} credit. When cards were closed we were owed {$1200.00}. Instead CAPITAL ONE put all XXXX cards in collections, and here is how you can immediatly identfy their error. They reported each card at the exact dollar amount the card had value. So if the card was {$800.00} card, {$600.00} of that was our secured deposit. So why would they put in collections we owed {$800.00}, and how come each card was rounded off to the exact dollar amount the card was worth. So we are suppose to believe if there was any last minute charges coming in after we closed accounts, they just so happened to add up to {$800.00} on the nose dollar and cents. All XXXX cards. This has caused severe damage to XXXX peoples credit. And they are still dinging our credit. This has cost us so much heartache. We have tried to contact them several times, we never had a missed payment and they owed us a balance. To this date, CAPITAL ONE SECURED CARD has not only refused to respond, but refused to show proof. They knew we were idenity theft, they knew we had issues with payment dropping and peeople we did n't know trying get cards on our account. These issues with CAPITAL ONE SECURED CARD have in 4 year time cost us an"
Capital One,I contacted Capital One about my credit card 's annual fee and what other cards I can get because the one I currently have does not seem worth it. It was assured that my annual fee would be fully waived/credited so I would not have to pay it to keep the card since they were not allowing me to upgrade to the no annual fee card that has the same exact benefits ( even though my credit score is in the range for that card ). My fee recently posted and they now are telling me all they can do is credit {$20.00} of the fee. I feel like I was scammed and this is a bait-and-switch. This is very unprofessional and I feel like I have no power since all representatives I called are not honoring their word.
Capital One,"I made 2 payments 1 ) XX/XX/2016 {$570.00} 2 ) XX/XX/2016 {$570.00} Capital one made balance adjustment on XX/XX/XXXX of a total {$1100.00} I asked to open a case on XX/XX/2016 XXXX ( supervisor ) acknowledging the payments did come from me, refused to open a case talking about misapplied payments to another account holder. I told XXXX I was contacting consumer finance"
Capital One,I settled both of my Capital One accounts with the law firms handling the debt. I have disputed the balance multiple items on my credit report to show updated as paid in full and Capital One is refusing to update it which is causing my credit score to remain really low. They ca n't do this and it needs to be removed from my credit report now since they are reporting inaccurate information.
Capital One,"I have new credit cards from CAPITAL One Bank, I was miles reward program which was converted in XXXX $ cash bonus if I spend XXXX $ during 3 months, I call several time to CPAITAL One award department and customer service told me that I was approved.

Capital One,"I work in the corporate office at Saks Fifth Avenue. My Saks credit account, ending XXXX, is in default after entering my updated XXXX checking account information into the SAKS Online system as well as made a payment though there even though no payment was due at the time -- the account on XXXX XXXX, in fact, reflected a credit of approximately {$100.00} in the Saks Online bill pay service. 

Then I signed in to update my account with my new banking information and made said payment with my new bank account to make sure it worked. When I got in today, five days later, I see I received an email that the payment did go through, although there are sufficient funds in my new XXXX checking account. This morning I 've called Captial One and XXXX XXXX Customer Service several times -- the first call, the operator, XXXX, could not locate my account at all. The second call was disconnected. The next few calls, the Customer Service rep suggested I speak with Saks , Inc. Human Resources and double-check that I entered the correct bank account #. I did everything asked by Saks , Inc. as well as Captial One Card Service representatives. I just signed in and re-entered my new bank account information, and YES, it says it is the same bank information entered last week. However, it will not allow me to use this information for the account, but this is my checking account. PLUS -- the account is now in default, Capital One has charged me fees, but I can not review the complete charges and I 'm being charged an interest rate of 24.24 % as well. As I try to recieve answers and help, my credit score will be affected, and if it is, will make it IMPOSSIBLE to maintain housing within the NY State. In fact, if this happens, I will be homeless, at least temporarily, until it is cleared with credit agencies, and restored to good standing. The last call ( of several on XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) with Captial One Services, I was transferred to "" XXXX '' ( who would not give me her last name ). I 'm being forced to repeat this story several times as I 'm transferred, and during ONLY working hours, Now XXXX told me I need to speak to my bank, but would I like to "" make a payment now? '' If I knew what I was paying for and could review the charges to my account to make sure my account security was not compromised, I would gladly make a payment. However, I can not view statements on the Online payment system -- or transaction history, it requires they be sent by mail only -- in which interest fees and late fees will accrue and my credit score will be affected. Any help you can provide is sincerely appreciated."
Capital One,I had numerous accounts with Capital one and have paid them all. There is one that is not mine showing on my credit reports. I have submitted my documentation on numerous occasions to resolve this matter and they keep sending me the same letter stating send documentation. This is not my account and I want it removed from my credit reports asap.
Capital One,"My wife and XXXX sons ( ages XXXX & XXXX ) went to XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The CapitalOne credit card she was using was hacked on XXXX XXXX, 2016. CapitalOne balanced out the fraudulent charges and closed the credit card account and told us that they will have a replacement card shipped to her, in XXXX XXXX, within XXXX5 business days. I called CapitalOne after 5 days when she did not receive the replacement card and was asked to wait for another day or XXXX. I called CapitalOne again after two days when the card did not arrive and demanded a tracking number and after several minutes on hold, I was told that they had an issue sending the card to the XXXX address, which the rep and I spent nearly 15 minutes to make sure it was correct, and that they took the liberty to send the replacement card to my XXXX home address via USPS and did not have a tracking number available. 
Reluctantly, I waited again for couple more days and never received the replacement card. 
It seems that they do not have any records on file of ever shipping a replacement card to my wife in XXXX XXXX or to me at the XXXX home address at this point in time. 

On XXXX XXXX, I gave up on trying to resolve this issue with the phone reps and decided to take my issue on their corporate XXXX page. I got a response stating that they would relay the message to a group that would call me soon ... which I never got a call back from, but for the interest of being fair, I did ask them not to call me until they had a resolution, meaning, I wanted them to take action to ship me a replacement card as soon as possible. I also sent an email to the CEO ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ) with no response. On XXXX XXXX 2016, with no other options left, I took a chance and sent my wife my CapitalOne credit card with my name on it via XXXX XXXX XXXX mail, hoping that she would not have any problems using it since it did not have her name on it ... and on the same day, I got a call from a rep from CapitalOne who reviewed the issue and took action to send me a replacement card to my home address overnight and the card arrived the next day. I sent the new card to my wife via XXXX XXXX XXXX mail again and she received it today ( XXXX XXXX, 2016 ). The entire process took 28 days and during the process, we were forced to spend what little cash we had while paying for various international bank fees for the transactions with our personal checking account. The vacation was planned for XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, 2016 and nearly half of the time was wasted waiting for the replacement card. I feel that CapitalOne has failed to meet the minimum quality of service and should be liable for their neglect."

I missed my payment by 4 days and made an in-store payment ( more than the Minimum amount ) on XX/XX/XXXX, 4 days late. 
The statement closed on XX/XX/XXXX, 2 days later. 
On my statement, I was charge a {$25.00} late fee and a 0.12 "" interest '' penalty on the late fee. 
I then proceeded to pay my Balance "" in full '' and a portion of the Late Fee. 
But, I was still charged an interest on the Late Fee. 
I requested a courtesy Refund of the Late Fee plus interest. They agreed to it. 
However, why is there no regulation preventing a Bank from charging interest on a Fee "" during '' the month that the Fee is incurred, before the consumer is even aware of it? When I asked the Credit Manager why do they do it? He just said, because there is no regulation that says they ca n't. That just does n't seem fair."

Upon reviewing my payments made on the Capitol One website, it clearly shows only XXXX payment credited to the acct of XXXX, yet XXXX payments were debited from my checking acct. On XXXX I received a letter stating that XXXX payment was paid on XXXX for acct XXXX and the other payment was for XXXX. I do n't have a Capitol One card with the last XXXX of XXXX!

Capital One,"Capital one has harassed me i told them many times that i had fraud charges on my account. the account was closed back in 2014. they were to remove the fraud charges but never did. after many many calls we got nowhere. they then tried to sue me for this debt for XXXX i was served with legal paper. this company was a joke they have made my life a nightmare. after all this i refused to pay a debt that was not mine but my wife offered to pay it and i refuse. She said she wanted to just be done with this so she called capital one many times they assured her once the debt was paid it would be a XXXX balance. she settled the debt for XXXX i believe, they promised her due to the fraud charges they would put the debt to XXXX dollars. and after everything they put us through you think they would stick to their word. They did not. this debt is still on my credit report and its still showing that i owe them when in fact i dont."
Capital One,"Capital One denied charges incorrectly stating they were fraudulent. 
Upon first request for information, they advised that a previous charge was potentially fraudulent because they did not receive XXXX ( which is odd, because the charge was swiped and approved ). Then they advised that the charge in question was out of pattern ( which is also odd, because they 've approved transactions at the merchant before ). 
Finally, they decided to cancel my account and could do nothing to assist in continuing the relationship because it was a secured account. This seems in complete violation of good faith negotiation and federal law and would not guarantee any kind of resolution or response to my complaint. Therefore, I felt compelled to file it with the CFPB."

Capital One,"Capital One Bank Credit Card - While out shopping card repeatedly kept declining. My first thought was that is fine since I had not used the card for shopping in quite sometime. I use monthly for Fitness Membership. 
So I decided to contact the fraud department to advise them that yes it is really me using the card. They were okay with that and said thanks for calling in for clarification/verification. I work in the XXXX XXXX Field so I really appreciated the Fraud Dept. looking out for my best interest. The only problem thereafter is that the card declined basically each time I tried using it and each time I called the fraud department. I was repeatedly advised that Capital One suspects fraud. Called the Executive office at XXXX and file a complaint with XXXX. I was advised it would take 7 to 10 business days for review. This was XXXX/XXXX/16. 
I called back to check the status XXXX/XXXX/16. XXXX with XXXX who advised me she would advise XXXX or whomever to please check the status of open case # XXXX. I called again today. XXXX called me back to let me know the case is still pending. I am contacting you because I do not feel they are taking my case seriously. I plan to travel out of the country XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/2016 and do not have faith my card will be authorized if used. I have never missed a payment with Capital One Bank. In fact, sent them a check for XXXX back in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/2016 thus paying off the card in question ending in XXXX and a good chunk of the one ending in XXXX. I commend their fraud efforts as a XXXX worker. However, they are taking it to the extreme. It 's almost like they do not want to be in the credit card business. It is so embarrassing trying use to use my card to be declined in front of a bunch of strangers."

As a precaution to help protect you against fraud, we 're reissuing your card with a new account number. There 's no need to call us unless you see transactions you do n't recognize. '' I called the company, Capital One, today, Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 at XXXX to ask what company had the data breach and what personal information was stolen. 
After speaking to a service rep and getting no where, I asked to speak to an account manager and was told that the company could not provide me with that information. 
I told the manager, XXXX, that I am entitled to that information. He again said they could not provide me with the information. 
I find this difficult to believe and would like you to investigate this nonsense and have someone provide me with the information I requested from Capital One. 
I want to know which company had the data breach so I do not shop there again."
Capital One,"I applied for a 0 % XXXX transfer credit card with Capital One, I was planing on using it to transfer a credit card balance of XXXX. I was approved for XXXX. I called them once I got the card to make the transfer, I was told I had to wait XXXX days. When I called after 10 days I was told there was no balance transfer offer approved for me, this was news to me! I called back and spoke to a different person who told me I did have the transfer offer on my account, so I just made the minimum payment on my other XXXX. When I called back to initiate the transfer I was told again there was no such offer for my account. have a credit score in the neighborhood of XXXX, besides my mortgage this would be my only debt. I have a networth of of over XXXX, so not a highrisk customer. 
Because of there missrepresantation I ended up having to pay interest on my othercard which I could have avoided if Capital one had honored the offer I was approved for."
Capital One,I paid my Capital One credit card off and I have a new XXXX but it still shows up on my credit report at least XXXX times
Capital One,I applied for a secured credit card through capital one XX/XX/2016 on XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX I was told my card was mailed out through an email and when I called in the rep told me my card was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told many times to wait 6-10 business day after that period I still did n't receive a card and was frustrated due to the long wait. I called 3 more times and asked if they could over night or send another that I have to sign for and was told they could through XXXX rep which he then transferred me but then I was told they do n't do that. Supposedly they send a XXXX card and cancelled out the first and I waited again 2 more weeks and still not XXXX of the XXXX cards came. I called again and asked for the cards and the account to be cancelled completely and for my security deposit back which was {$200.00} that was taken from my checking account in XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( it cleared ). The rep said he 'd cancel the overall account and I spoke to many managers and supervisors and here it is XXXX XXXX 2016 and I still have received neither of the cards they claim they sent or my security deposit check. I 'm worried because I 've read their reviews and it seems as though this may be common with capital one. I do not want to be ripped off for my money that I need and it 's mine to begin with. So if someone can please do something about this and stop companies from deceiving customers I 'd appreciate it.
Capital One,"Capital One 's Fraud Department sent me an email asking to verify possible fraud on my account. I was attempting to verify that it was fraud and accidentally hit yes on the email and then I attempted to call them once I realized that I had selected the wrong option and I was on hold for 45 minutes mind you. Long story short, Ive had fraud on my account, and I did not receive or benefit from any of the services. I know for a fact that my signature was used to sign for any goods or services and almost 3 months later they are trying to hold me accountable for fraudulent charges that I did not make. Charges were made to big retailers like XXXX and such and I have already closed account the account."
Capital One,"I applied for credit and received a letter stating that my credit bureau indicates I was deceased. I called both the credit reporting agency and the card company but no one could tell me why the bureau said I was deceased, and Kohl 's could not tell me anything about the application."
Capital One,"I believe I 've been the victim of a timeshare fraud in XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I entered into an agreement with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. They agreed to pay me {$15000.00} for my residence at XXXX XXXX, which I purchased in XXXX, if I paid them {$110000.00}. The transaction was headed by a gal name XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I have included all the pertinent contact information for both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, the contract and all the information, pertaining to my dispute, which I sent to my credit card company. I 've also included the emails I just received from XXXX XXXX. 

The reason I believe it is fraud, is that the same thing happened to another person with whom I had a conversation, and the exact details of my experience were the same as theirs. They employed the services of an attorney and finally were able to retrieve their money. 

The promise of this deal is that if I give them the {$11000.00} they will pay me {$15000.00} for my XXXX XXXX property within 90 days. The bottom line is that they get their money but for various reasons I will never see mine."
Capital One,"Capital One Bank ( USA ) , N.A . ( "" the Bank '' ) is engaging in unfair, deceptive, abusive acts and practices by violating my rights under the account holder agreement for my Capital One Visa Platinum account. I recently relocated to a new state and updated my billing information with the Bank. Apparently this modification triggered a fraud alert in their system, which prevents me from accessing any account information ; information I need to remit payments and review ( 1 ) my balance, ( 2 ) account activity, including debits and credits, and ( 3 ) a copy of my rights under the account holder agreement. At the encouragement of the Bank, I foolishly enrolled in online statements, I do n't receive paper statements regularly. As a result, this system that is now prohibiting my access is my only source of this data. 

While I am not particularly concerned about ever using this account to make purchases again, I believe that Capital One is violating a number of consumer protection laws by not sharing my current balance or transaction data with me until I produce an onerous amount of documentation to prove who I am ( apparently the multiple telephone identity verification processes and desire to pay my bill are not sufficient proof of who I am ). The Bank does not have the authority to make such a demand or, if they do, I would n't know because I am unable to access a copy of my account holder agreement to review my rights. 

A large bank like Capital One should know that there are many identity verification services such as XXXX XXXX or even the USPS change of address system that would provide ample proof to the Bank of who I am and that I relocated. 

This action may be pervasive and affecting consumers at large. I encourage the CFPB to issue a Civil Investigatory Demand ( CID ) to the Bank to determine whether or not this is a widespread issue. This fraud block prevents a consumer from accessing information needed in order to pay their bill, potentially causing severe harm to consumers. I believe that this demonstrates, at best, willful neglect on the part of Capital One Bank who would certainly continue to charge additional interest and late penalties, furnish data to credit reporting agencies or charge off this account should I fail to remit regular payment on this account. 

Other, more responsible financial institutions, have implemented effective alternative methods to ensure that accounts with suspected fraudulent activity do not incur additional charges while still allowing the account holder to access relevant data about their account. 

I was able to obtain an unverified total current balance from the fraud manager who I spoke with after I was told it was a violation of their policy/procedure to provide this information to me. I have remitted a payment for this full amount to the Bank, although I have not had an opportunity to review the transactions which make up this balance."
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX 2016 I received a notice from CapitalOne "" XXXX Credit Card '' about an apparently fraudulent charge of {$880.00} to my account. I confirmed to them ( by phone ) that I was unfamiliar with the company making the charge, and had never had any dealings with them. They assigned a case number : XXXX and sent me a letter acknowledging the problem. I have since had repeated messages on my answering machine from XXXX of their agents stating that they require more information to settle this matter, and instructing me to phone back. XXXX attempts over a period of several days to reach this agent at the phone number he provided have been directed to his voice mail, which claims that he will phone me back. He does n't, and my attempts to reach him are in vain. A protracted conversation yesterday with a customer-service representative resulted in her earnest promises that I would be called back with 18 hours. I have heard nothing since. I am concerned that having no opportunity to provide CapitalOne with whatever information they require about this fraudulent charge will result in their holding me responsible for it. I need someone to prod them into accepting my calls."
Capital One,"Went overseas XX/XX/XXXX taking only XXXX credit card : Capital One. I went out of my way to research the best card for travel, especially in terms of rental car insurance and other travel benefits. At some point after being in XXXX I received email that they were sending me another card as they were updating to chip cards. I called and to tell them ( although they already had notice I was overseas ) that I was not at that address and could they send overseas ; I was then at a hotel in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. They said they could send overseas by regular mail. I told them that was not a safe, smart or responsible thing to do and that by the time it arrived ( if it ever arrived ) I would probably not be there. I pleaded to send via XXXX at my cost. The said they would not. Of course I never received the card. I called their customer service several times to say I had not received the card. I was assured my card was still good "" till XX/XX/2016 ''. I went into hospital when in XXXX and card was declined. Hospital would not complete treatment until card is approved. Spent over an hour on the phone with them at hospital and finally got payment approved. XX/XX/XXXX I was able to return to US. Before leaving XXXX called Capital One to verify that card would still be honored -- I needed it to rent a car once in US etc etc and again, it was my only credit card. I was assured the card would be honored -- this time I was told it would be honored indefinitely not just till XX/XX/XXXX. Landed at XXXX, took shuttle to XXXX XXXX where I had a reservation and card is declined! Called customer service and they said I should be using my chip card! I explained why I did not have a chip card and explained the assurance I was given before leaving for the US. Agent was able to verify I was given erroneous information by their agent. I asked what they can do to help me, ( esp. as I was in this dilemma due to their errors ) and that I was stranded at XXXX. Even after much pleading, trying to reason with them, they said there was nothing they would do. I ended up getting XXXX to accept a Visa debit card I was also carrying. Just before dropping off car in XXXX I accidentally scraped the rear door and punctured a tire with a rock bordering a parking lot. Only then I realized although I had put it on a Visa card, I had no rental car insurance. If I would have not been given erroneous information by Capital One, or if they had sent me the card overseas as I pleaded, I would not be in this problem. As it is I am waiting for XXXX XXXX to tell me how much I owe them. I imagine it will at least be several hundred dollars."
Capital One,"I received my first statement from Capital One XXXX the day before they called me last week. The due date was XXXX XXXX, 2016. They made me pay XXXX because they said it was late. The due date was XXXX XXXX 2016. They were late mailing the statement out then. I paid the XXXX late fee but if I do n't receive a statement then how do I know it is late then? I can not read their minds."
Capital One,Each month I receive my credit card statement I make a payment usually the minimum amount due and sometimes a little more. Once I make a payment the amount paid is reflected as my available credit plus any credit that has remained from the last statement. Example : I receive my statement and the minimum amount due is XXXX. I make the payment in the amount of XXXX dollars and my credit card account shows XXXX dollars available credit plus any existing available credit remaining from the last statement. The issue or concern I have is that when I receive a new statement I have a new minimum amount due and my available credit has been reduced subtracting interest that has accrued instead of the interest being calculated along with other transactions that would give me my monthly minimum amount due. It 's almost like I am being double billed. It is my understanding that the interest charges are calculated in the minimum amount due each month and the only time available credit would be reduced is when purchases are made.I do n't know any other bank or financial institution that reduces your available credit because of interest charges.
Capital One,Had cash back bonus available & over 3 months ago I called to have it applied to balance. Now the status of the card has changed and because they never did it 3 month ago now they wo n't. The card was Capital One and I just wanted my bonus to be used towards paying my debt and they did n't do their job then or now.Why is that ok that they do n't have to uphold their end of the contract but I do!
Capital One,An unauthorized credit inquiry was made on all XXXX reporting agencies by capital one. I continue to get solicitation from this company even after I requested that they stop
Capital One,"In 2013, I had a XXXX Credit card with Capital One Bank on which I defaulted. Their collection efforts were unethical as they harassed and intimidated me to settle the account in full. I felt harmed by the stress and intimidation they caused me."
Capital One,"I had transferred a balance to the Capital One credit card with promotional rate of 0 % interest. However the promotion was ok in first month but Capital One started charging interest on the balance, increased my minimum payment, which resulted my automatic payment to fall short and charging more fees on top on the interest rate. I called XXXX XXXX and they "" opened '' a case saying they have to review the call recordings and in 2 to 3 weeks someone will call back. i said that is too long, the rep supposedly increased the level and said someone call you in a week. Its been about month with no calls and no change in the account regarding interest rate and promotion. I called after XXXX weeks passing and still no answer i am told by a manager capital one needs few more weeks with no guarantee and they are waiting for another info from another department and giving me no information nor working with me to resolve the issue, which initially they said they have to listen to the call, if they listen to the call its clear on the call and they will see the truth. This is costing me over {$200.00} in interest fees and much higher minimum payment resulting in financial problems. I need this taken care asap. Its a simple fix. No one transfers {$18000.00} with interest rate of over 20 %. All they have to do is listen to the call that i made the transfer on. It is clear on the call. More time passes they are gon na they do n't have the recording anymore. This is fraud and stealing money."
Capital One,I was notified in an email of a fraud alert on my credit card and was asked to provide some documents to verify my identity. I provided such documents and after 6 weeks noticed that my account was in the same status. I called to determine the nature of the problem and customer service personnel informed me that they needed further proof of my identity. No one had called me or emailed me during this time to say that additional information was needed.
Capital One,"I lost my job and I had protection on both of my Capital One credit cards. In the meantime, my partner, was the person who always paid my card payments, monthly from HER account. This went on for 4 years approximately. When I was laid off from my job XX/XX/XXXX, I waited the 30 day period Capital One requests before the protection can kick in. When I called they had informed me that I did not have this protection and that it was cancelled XX/XX/XXXX, I advised them I was not the person who cancelled this and that it was possibly my live in partner, who I did not authorize to do so. The woman told me that there was nothing she can do and that I would have to wait for them to pull the tapes and investigate the call. Ironically, I also was informed that this was the same month and year that Capital One stopped offering XXXX XXXX in cases of someone losing a job. I voiced my concern with this, as well as me not authorizing anything to be cancelled and informed her of my partner wrongfully taking my credentials to do things soley because SHE was the one paying for my bills at that time. A few days later I received a phone call and the woman I spoke with rudely told me there was nothing they can do and that the voice tapes states its me who infact cancelled these services and that they were refunded back to my account. I told her I was NOT the one who did this and that I wanted to escalate, she told me that I could not because they pulled tapes. I said well, how do you have proof that it is me? Anyone can call in that is a female, as long as they have the proper information, state they want to do anything to an account. Which is what happened with my ex girlfriend. I told her if I had another females credentials, I also can do the same. Just because someone stated they were me, proceeded to give information, does not mean they are me. I also explained that I found it funny that this was the second time in several years that Capital One had "" claimed '' my protection if I became unemployed was "" cancelled '' on both cards. This also happened XX/XX/XXXX to me. In which I added it back on and let it go. The woman told me the only thing she can do is adjust the account, which STILL has n't been done, but that is all. She can not help and I am left hanging with payments now behind on both cards due to unemployment."
Capital One,"My husband is on a solo bicycle trip In XXXX XXXX. Not wanting to take cash, he took XXXX credit card Capital One Visa. While In a very remote location, without any warning Capital One Visa deactivated both my husband 's and my cards and All transactions rejected. I am not In need of the card but my husband is stranded in a remote arena without means to pay for food or shelter. When he contacted Capital one, they connected him to the Fraud divison. They said the card was rejected and wo n't give a reason why. They requested him to send them certain identification information He did tthis. Capital One Visa response was that this was not sufficent and requested he send more information which he did not carry with him. He called me In the US & I sent the additional information. I have confirmation that they recieved it, yet they say they have not recieve it. I sent the same required Information to my husband in XXXX & he resent it. This dispite capital one Viisa Venture card is requesting personal information that was not required to even qualify for this card. Im concerned & suspicious In addition to being very upset with the non concern, rude treatment from the members of the Fraud staff. They even told me that this capital One Visa Venture card is not connected to Capital One Bank. I am afraid this is a scam and invollves the Use of giving bonus points after spending {$3000.00} dollars within 3 months. We paid them {$3900.00} within one month and they canceled the Capital One Visa Venture card at the most inoportune time possible, to avoid the bonus offer. No reason, No help, and it appears possible data mining & possible identification Fraud from the "" Fraud Dept '' of Capital One Venture Visa. I reguest you please investigate this company and prevent others from this most distressing experence."
Capital One,"A Capital One credit card was opened in my name in XXXX/XXXX/2013. I did not apply for this card and I never used the card. Capital One can has NO receipts with my signature. 

I am asking that this account be removed as it is not my account. I never applied for it."
Capital One,"Capital One credit card phone representative agreed to remove XXXX 2013, 30 day late they reported as an error because of my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Immediately Auto Pay was fixed and payment has never been missed in excess of 29 days or more."
Capital One,"Purchased {$300.00} worth of merchandise online with my Capital One Visa Card on XXXX, XXXX, 2016. Merchandise came severely damaged about one week after purchase date. I contacted the merchant who stated they would resolve the problem and pick up the merchandise and issue a refund. Merchant never sent carrier to pick up merchandise. I disputed the charge on XXXX XXXX, 2016 with Capital One. My letter of dispute clearly stated what the merchandise was, the date of the charge, the amount of the charge, that I had attempted to resolve the matter with the merchant, and that I was disputing the charge. On XXXX XXXX Capital One writes back asking me to reiterate everything I already told them plus asked questions that were irrelevant such as : 1 ) Date I expected to receive the merchandise? 2 ) Did I receive a contract? 3 ) Was there a trial period? 4 ) Did I review the cancellation policy? 5 ) What is the merchants return policy? 6 ) Did I abide by the return policy? 7 ) A second opinion from another merchant on a company letterhead and signed by the other merchant. 8 ) A signed and dated proof of return. 

I also included a statement in my return with the XXXX page letter that the merchant was free to pick up the box of damaged merchandise at any time as it was waiting to be picked up. 

After filling out there XXXX page letter of immaterial information that is not required by the XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, Capital one provides a credit to my account of {$300.00} on XXXX XXXX, 2016. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 Capital One reverses the credit and reapplies the charge to my account now stating that merchant "" confirmed the charge is valid '' The merchant provided no statement that they attempted to pick the merchandise up ( they did not ) or that I refused to allow them to pick it up or anything to that nature. Just that the customer made the charge and it is valid. The merchant provided no reason or care that they delivered damaged merchandise. The merchant did not dispute whether or not the merchandise was damaged. 

It is well known that in a long distance ( mail/online order ) transaction that is shipped it is the sellers responsibility to get the merchandise there in good condition. The buyer has the full right to reject the merchandise if is not as ordered or otherwise damaged. See FTC bulletin on the Fair Credit Billing Act that clearly states the Act covers : "" charges for goods and services you did n't accept or were n't delivered as agreed '' at XXXX. Instead Capital One ignored the XXXX and recharged the card with no rebuttal from the merchant regarding the damaged merchandise or why they did not have it returned back to them. 

My complaint pertains the failure of Capital One to follow the guidelines as set out by the XXXX. There is/was no authority to place the charge back on my account. 

I phoned Capital One on the XXXX of XXXX and was told that I now have a right to send another letter. I asked what would I possibly put in the next letter that I have not already stated? It is real simple. I ordered merchandise. It came damaged. I called the merchant and reported it damaged. The merchant never solved the problem. I had already said this XXXX time previously plus Capital One now wants me to say it again plus they now tell me it may take 90 days to get a final decision all the while I have the charge back on my account. 

My complaint here does not pertain the XXXX that is due me. I expect I will eventually get that back and reserve the right to open another complaint if I do not within 90 days from now. The real issue is the way Capital One handles disputes. It seems that Capital One keeps sending the same request for information hoping that I will forget to send back a letter and then use that to close the dispute against me. All unfair billing practices."
Capital One,"My husband and I had an Identity Theft problem which effected several areas, someone had taken payday loans out of our local bank, this was resolved by the bank internally, and the bank drew back over {$5000.00} from the payday loan companies to replace the money they had taken. Several credit card companies also harrassed us for some time, we reported the problem to the Federal Trade Commission, the A.G. office, and we filed Identity theft forms with several agencies. XXXX XXXX has now filed a lawsuit on a credir card company, Capital One who wrote off the claim, and sold collection rights XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX from Capital One was issued in XX/XX/XXXX, that is the card that we are being sued for an amount of about {$1800.00}. Capital One issued a Capital One credit card to my wife in XX/XX/XXXX, why would the same credit card company issue another card when the other card, different number issued again in XX/XX/XXXX. We asked XXXX XXXX to produce a signed application document with Capital One to prove that my wife never signed for the credit card we are being sued for, they never provided this or a complete paper trail we asked for, what else can we do? 

XXXX XXXX"
Capital One,"Contacted by XXXX XXXX stating they can help me get 0 % balance transfer for 12 months and if I pay on time they would continue to renew the 0 % every 12 months until I paid off the credit card. I ask them to put it in writing on company or credit card letterhead. Instead they sent me an Email, and when I call them back and told them this was unacceptable, they started the process without my approval. Capital One issued a credit card and stated the balance transfers were for 3 months only. I was not aware that the company applied for the card and I decided not to activate the credit card. I contacted Capital One to get an understanding and concluded they could care less. They became disrespectful, so I told them that I did not want the card, please clear the credit information on my credit report, and they told me that they will report it as a closed account ( which will lower your credit score ) even though the account was never activated. This is wrong, but they did not care."
Capital One,"Had some fraud on a credit card so my financial institution. Capital One issues me a new card on the same account. I have some recurring transactions on the card and was updating that information but had n't gotten around to all of the vendors. At one point I logged into XXXX as I saw a charge on my new card from them I look and I see that they have my updated card information. I initially thought that I had updated the card and just did n't remember, so I shrugged it off. But then I saw a charge from XXXX, XXXX and I KNEW I did not give them my new card number because I had intended to move that recurring charge to another form of payment. I logged into my account and not only had the charge gone through but now XXXX has my new card number. I had never given to them nor authorized anyone else to give it to them. 

I called my financial institution and they said it was XXXX. I called XXXX and they said it was my financial institution. I did some digging on XXXX 's website. And sure enough they sell it as a service to their merchant customers. XXXX No one will tell me how I opt out of this or even if I can opt-out. But I find it an unacceptable security risk that someone is providing a third party with my private financial data, my credit card number, without my express consent. 

I understand the convenience this provides both businesses and consumers, but I feel this is something I should have to opt-in to, or at the very least be able to opt-out of."
Capital One,XXXX of my customers file a dispute on a transaction after buying a scooter from me and keeping the items. Contact Capital 1 to get my money back on my account and fax proof of purchase and as of today Capital did n't credit my account back. Transaction amount of {$800.00}.

I had an issue with my senior dog being aggressive, contacted the company via XXXX and explained. They advised to bring the dog back. ( conversation attached ). they then only reimbursed me 50 % of the price. I left before an altercation started. I came home to file a credit card dispute. The dispute with Capital one was first filed in XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I receive a letter stating they decline the dispute. The Merchant, altered the contract and added a return policy and submitted to capital one as evidence. I immediately called capital one again and escalated to a manager. After a 3 hour conversation, the manager finally compared the contract and agreed! She re-submitted the credit card dispute. That was XXXX XXXX. Now we come to XXXX XXXX and I again receive the same message. This time no additional evidence from the Merchant, but Capital one again looking at only their contract. I attempt to escalate to XXXX different managers asking them to look at the documents and compare them. All tell me I signed a return policy. I have been a perfect paying customer of theirs for years, now have no other option as I have proof of what I signed to wait to go to court. I do not owe {$890.00}"
Capital One,I had a Capital One Credit Card account that was opened in XXXX and paid and closed in XXXX. Recently Capital One reported my account to the credit agencies as a charged off account. I contacted Capital One and the representative stated that the information was a mistake and the derogatory account with be removed the credit reports. I recently checked my reports again the information is still appearing on my reports. Once again I contacted Capital One and another representative stated I owe {$1800.00} I stated this account was paid in full at the bank. I send Capital One the receipt and about 2 1/2 weeks later they apologize ancestors once again the stated the the information will be removed from the reports.
Capital One,I received a letter from XXXX stating I had a balance from a capital one credit card. I asked them when this was opened and to send me the proof that this was my debt they said it could take ninety days I responded with you have thirty according to the law that is enough time for you to get me the information. They then sent me a letter 36 days later without proof the debt was mine and said they had just opened an investigation into the matter thirty days later. I called in response to this letter and asked them to stop their collection efforts and to remove this from my credit file immediately since they could not provide the necessary information in the time slotted.
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I made a charge to my Capital One Master Card in the amount of {$48.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, WV for a deposit on a lodge reservation. I called XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and cancelled our reservation, which was within their cancellation policy, and they were to refund the deposit. XXXX XXXX made the refund to my Capital One Master Card on XXXX XXXX, 2015, however ; they erroneously made the refund for {$590.00} instead of {$48.00}. XXXX XXXX tried to do a charge back for the erroneous balance but it was declined. I have been working with XXXX XXXX since then in calling Capital One to have them return their money. Capital One refuses to return the balance to XXXX XXXX. My account is currently on hold due to payment issues as I am XXXX. This should not even be an issue as Capital One is only entitled to {$48.00} credit which was the original charge amount. XXXX XXXX has told Capital One that they made the error. I am being held hostage by Capital One as they will not release the money back to XXXX XXXX until I pay my account up to date and keep it current for 60 days. This is not in any way my error and I do n't understand why Capital One feels like they can keep someone else 's money. This has been going on for weeks with phone calls and XXXX!! Capital One should return the money to XXXX and deal with me for my personal account which has nothing to do with the merchant! This in my eyes is illegal and the XXXX has thrown my XXXX XXXX putting my health in a bad place right now."
Capital One,"Applied for a credit card with Capital One. Application process makes you jump through all these hoops, including income verification through fax/snail mail, which is insulting considering no other credit card issuer requires that information ( and considering my previous account with CapOne ). I subsequently provide the necessary documentation through their antiquated methods ( i.e., fax ). Three weeks go by without hearing back prompting a call to customer service. Customer service is inept, ca n't find the info to process the application, refuse to do anything else to help. Absolutely done with this company, they 've lost a customer for life."
Capital One,"I disputed the following charge online, since the merchant and the transaction are completely unknown :. Despite I filed a dispute online, the charge was reapplied to my account XXXX. I also provided additional information in writing ( online chat - I do not have more information since the charge is unknown ) which was not considered.

XXXX/XXXX/2016 Capital One Chat XXXX ... XXXX Please"
Capital One,"In XXXX XXXX, I was notified by Capital One that there was fraudulent activity on my account. Since that time ( now XXXX XXXX ), I have called twice a week, every week, to inquire to the status of my account. No one seems to be able to assist me and instructs me to inquire at a later time, by file is being handled by a "" fraud specialist '', whom is never available and has n't returned a SINGLE phone call since XX/XX/XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, I was notified by a credit report monitoring service that a late payment has been posted ( 60 days late ). Not a single person at Capital One would accept a payment from me while the case was being investigated but meanwhile the interest and payments were accruing. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I 've had to deal with the most inept, incompetent individuals and they have cost me a great credit score, all the while, now telling me that the situation was rectified in XX/XX/XXXX ( however, I just called and was told that was one still being investigated ). They accepted one payment from me on XXXX account, but not another. I want the late payment removed from my account immediately!"
Capital One,"I feel harassed by the Capital One credit card division. In the last 30 days I have received two emails form Capital One stating as below ( in quotes, italicized ) : "" Our fraud defenses flagged one or more purchase ( s ) below as unusual for your VISA SIGNATURE card ending in XXXX. Do you or an authorized user recognize these purchases? If we 've already spoken about this, you can ignore this email. 

Some things to consider when reviewing your purchases : If a dollar amount differs from your record, it could be a pre-authorization. For example, many gas stations pre-authorize an amount ( usually between $ XXXX- {$75.00} ) because they do n't know how much gas you 'll pump. 
If a purchase is legitimate but you want to cancel it, you have to contact the merchant directly '' Email XXXX XXXX, XXXX : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$79.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$9.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX {$20.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX {$13.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX # XXXX {$21.00} Email XXXX XXXX, XXXX : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$79.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX {$26.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX {$13.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX # XXXX {$84.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$50.00} In my opinion, there is nothing unusual or suspicious about the listed transactions, as these are recurring payments ( such as XXXX or XXXX ) or purchases in the XXXX miles radius from the place where I live. My FICO credit score is above XXXX. I had paid in full the card balance listed in each statement since the commencement of the card, so I assume that is a reason that for Capital One may label me as a "" bad customer '' who can not be charged late fees and interest. I have over XXXX reward points for my purchases on my Capital One credit card. 
In my opinion, Capital One is making consolidated efforts to take away these reward points by discouraging me from normal use of my credit card. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I had spoken twice with Capital One Customer Service supervisors asking why I am getting cited emails and which transactions are suspicious. Last conversation was with XXXX, ID # XXXX. Neither supervisor was able to explain why I am getting emails, and which transaction triggers it. However, they confirmed that my credit card might be suspended if I do not validate transactions listed in the email. In both conversations my request for a written explanation was denied. Agents of Capital One also denied fixing an issue and any written assurance that Capital One will make any necessary steps to avoid closing accounts and sending emails for non-specified reasons. 
I am finding the actions of Capital One as a consistent and elevated effort to violate card agreement by the discouragement of customers like me to use their accounts and gain rewards that are part of the agreement, or to further to take away reward points. 
In summary, I am asking The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to record my complaint and possibly check if Capital One 's practices fall into standards of the banking industry."
Capital One,"A few months ago, I file a complaint against Capital One Credit Card regarding XXXX fraud alert letters I received from its Fraud Department. 
I had been instructed to send a copy of a state identification card, social security card and proof of street address. Before sending the same, I verified the validity of the three letters. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I faxed the requested document to the number provided by Capital One. To date, the company still claims that it has not received the same. I, in turn, notified all XXXX major credit bureaus regarding the fraud alert. I received a reply for XXXX which stated Capital One had frozen all XXXX accounts because I had exceeded my limit on XXXX and failed to make the XXXX XXXX payment on time. As a result, my credit score was dropped to XXXX. When I contacted Capital One, I told the Fraud Department representative that based on the letters from CO, the accounts were frozen because of alleged fraud. As well, I had to verify my identification with CO, yet, it allowed someone to open a XXXX account under the pretext that the person was me. 
Last week, I contacted CO about a payment on XXXX of the legitimate accounts and I was reprimanded for failing to provide requested documents verifying my ID. I explained to the representative that I failed to understand how CO protect my identity when it allowed someone to open a XXXX card. 
I was told that the account had been closed and removed from my credit report. 
CO never notified me of the same, nor, as it claims, was CO able to verify identity. I never received any notice ( letter, email, or telephone ) clearing the Journey account and I need to know what CO is doing to resolve this matter. As present, CO is damaging my ability to apply for credit or a loan. I need CO to resolve this matter quickly and amicably. 
As for the purported late payment, I obtained a receipt from my bank indicating that the payment was paid on time on XXXX."
Capital One,"Capital One is requesting a high minimum payment of XXXX, the account is past due and has been, which I understand. However, this amount is too much to pay and is more than my weekly paycheck, it will have to be lowered. I did attempt to have this amount lowered by speaking with numerous reps, all were in the collections dept. They are more interested in making a payment arrangement than actually lowering amount due, an arrangement is just to get some payment out of me regardless if any additional fees or assessed. Please advise them payment amount will have to be lowered."
Capital One,"The available credit on my account with Capital One is down from over XXXX available from yesterday to only XXXX today, XX/XX/XXXX. The attached screen shot shows all transactions both posted and pending, they still do not add up to show difference in available credit. Despite chatting with XXXX different chat reps, both slow/inept with bad English, I am unable to figure out the difference from having over XXXX available yesterday to XXXX today. The reason I am concerned among others is because I had a transaction get declined from XXXX due to low available credit. Also, there appears to be some transaction ( s ) which are not showing as posted or even pending which is cause of the problem. The attached screen shot from today shows all items posted and pending, do not account for difference in available credit"
Capital One,"I signed up for XXXX insurance based on assurances from the insurance company that my XXXX was in their network and XXXX were covered. It cost me {$100.00} to start the insurance and the monthly amount of {$37.00} was to be drafted on my Capital One credit card. After I received the information from the XXXX, I discovered the discrepancies in what I thought I was paying for and what I actually bought. I sent an email on XXXX XXXX, XXXX cancelling the coverage and requesting a refund. No response from the XXXX company, Upon checking my XXXX XXXX Capital One card statement, I saw a charge for the XXXX payment. I called the company on or about XXXX XXXX, XXXX to ask why I was being charged since I cancelled via email on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I was told by their customer service representative that they would look into whether they had received my cancellation email but I would not be charged after XXXX XXXX and XXXX received a refund of my XXXX XXXX payment. I was assured that my 'membership ' was cancelled effective XXXX XXXX and I would not be charged in the future. It was n't until XXXX XXXX that I saw I was still being charged {$37.00} for the insurance membership on my Capital One credit card. I immediately called the company, sent them the email from XXXX XXXX, XXXX and requested a refund. The customer rep told me she would research whether they had received the XXXX XXXX email but could not do it that day since it was time for her to get off work and it was a Friday. She was to call me the following Monday but my membership was cancelled effective XXXX XXXX. She was not sure if management would refund my payments from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. The company never contacted me. Any contact was initiated by me on this matter. In the interim, I requested Capital One to reverse the charges/payments for this time period for this company. I sent them a copy of the XXXX XXXX, XXXX email cancelling the insurance membership. Capital One did reverse the charges but them sent me a letter stating I did not send copies of receipts of the charges so they reapplied the charges to my account. Since these were automatic drafts or charges to my account, I never had receipts for the charges. Therefore, I am filing a complaint against Capital One. I would also like to file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX."
Capital One,"I have sent Capital One several requests for validation and investigation regarding XXXX accounts listed on my credit report. I first reported them as fraud but Capital One said they had limited information. I 'm not sure how else to say it 's not me!!!. I asked for validation and investigation including my original signature and they keep sending letters that say they need more information. The letter Capitol one sends only has the last XXXX numbers in an account showing- the accounts listed on my credit report do n't show the last XXXX numbers. There is no way to match them. I sent 3 request to the credit reporting bureaus and they can not validate the accounts either, Capital one needs to delete me from their system they have had more than 3 months and multiple requests to provide complete and accurate information and they have not done it."
Capital One,"Charges to my credit card in excess of the available balance are being approved rather than declined. I contacted the bank to see about changing this and seems I can not. There is no charge for going over the limit, but I do not want my account to be able to go over its limit. If the account is over limit during a statement it will get reported and effect my credit score. The account was not always this way and it seems some recent change I dislike but seem to have no control over."
Capital One,I XXXX XXXX filed bankruptcy chapter XXXX four years ago case no XXXX curently i '' m selling home and the tile company find XXXX judements against my property capital one and XXXX XXXX -credit cards. Tile company offer me they will hold the amunt of the judements for 150 % and return too me after 2 years when the judements wiil be expired Atorrney who represent me durning bankruptcy is XXXX XXXX.
Capital One,"After eleven years in business, my partner and I were forced to close our company on XXXX/XXXX/16 due to insurmountable financial difficulties as a result of the economic downturn over the past several years. Since the company was an XXXX, I was responsible for all credit cards where my name appeared on the card along with the company name. 
Both my partner and I each had several credit cards to deal with. Since the company had no assets whatsoever, I contacted each of the credit card companies and all were resolved except XXXX, Capital One which I first contacted on XXXX/XXXX/16 in an attempt to secure Debt Forgiveness in the form of a settlement so that I could begin to move on and deal with additional company issues. I was told on that date that XXXX XXXX could not offer a settlement "" at this time '' because the account was not overdue long enough. I then called back on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. Over the course of these calls, I spoke to approximately XXXX different reps / supervisors and more than once I spoke to the same person twice. I was told on XXXX that in order for my request to be considered I should write a letter and fax or mail it to the General Correspondence Department at Cap 1 explaining my circumstances which I did and I faxed it to that department on XXXX. Two days later I received a letter from Cap 1 saying that they were "" unable to fulfill my request through written correspondence '' and that I should contact them at the XXXX # listed below. When I called, the merry go round started all over again. I have spent approximately XXXX15 hours in total on the telephone with various reps and account supervisors with no resolution in sight. 
Not one of these reps / supervisors ( I was told ) was authorized to negotiate a settlement nor could they transfer me to anyone who could nor could they give me a reason as to why my request could not be resolved except to say a settlement was not on offer "" at this time ''. In essence, they have been stalling while my interest rate has increased by 13 % causing the total of my bill to increase significantly as well. Maybe this is their strategy. 
Despite the fact that I am retired, collecting Social Security ( not even the maximum ) and without a pension, Cap 1 refuses to negotiate with me in good faith. This is in complete contrast to what they claim on their website regarding Debt Settlement. It appears that Cap 1 is misrepresenting their policies and is engaging in unfair business practices. 
Insofar as all our other creditors have met us half way, I never expected my dealings with Capital One to be so difficult and stressful. The manner in which they do business with their customers who fall on hard times is appalling and abusive. All of their reps seem to be reading from a script / talking points, unable to offer any help whatsoever. They all say the same thing, "" no offer is available at this time ''. 
So, "" at this time '', I am exactly where I was when I started except that I am now further in debt to Capital One."
Capital One,"I hesitate to take the time to write another review after the hundreds of bottom-scraping reviews of Capital One credit cards that are already online. However, since people have different situations maybe this review pertains more to you. 

Background : My credit score is XXXX out of a possible XXXX. I 've never once had a late payment to anyone over the past fifty years. I 've recommended Capital One many times to friends because they do n't charge 1 % for charges overseas. 

My reward for the customer loyalty is utter incompetence on the one occasion that I 've had a problem. Capital One 's Fraud Department is grossly incompetent. 

Brief rundown after more than two weeks of daily phone calls : 1. Despite obvious fraud ( {$15000.00} at an XXXX XXXX halfway across the country from where I live ) Capital One did n't catch this. There was no credit warning. I found the charges online and had to call them. They took all my information and shut down my account saying the case would be addressed within 72 hours and that I would receive a phone call. 
2. No phone call. When I called them after 72 hours nothing at all had been done. There were no notes in the account of anyone in the Fraudulent Fraud Department having even looked at the issue. They then told me that to initiate the investigation I had to drive 45 minutes to my bank and have the bank manager call them to identify me. I did that. Capital One then told the bank manager that I 'd received incorrect information and that I had to email them a copy of my driver 's licence. 
3. I emailed them my driver 's license and waited another 72 hours. Again, no one called. I called them. After many long holds I was told that the driver 's license was n't what they needed. I needed to find my original Social Security Card from XXXX years ago and send them a copy. 
4. I did send them a copy of my SS card along with a bill stating my name and address. Another XXXX hours and no contact. I called them back. 
5. They then told me that the SS card and bill were not adequate, so I needed to drive to the bank and have the bank manager call to identify me. See # 2 above. Second trip to the bank. 
6. The bank manager called Capital One. They took his number at the bank and said they would call him back at that number. Forty-five minutes ; no call. The bank manager called back. They had copied down his number incorrectly. 
7. They said that they had contacted me through a text to my phone. I had told them previously that the thief had also stolen my phone number. Capital One insisted on texting information on how to gain access to my account to the THIEF. I asked several times for them to take my new phone number. They refused to take the correct phone number. 
8. Their phone lines drop calls constantly and they will not allow you to speak to the person who just spoke to you, nor will they take your phone number, so you start the process over time and time again. 
9. When I finally got someone competent on the phone his first reaction was that he was stunned. He could n't believe what had happened, beginning with no fraud alert on an obviously fraudulent purchase and ending with the fact that no one in the Fraudulent Department had taken note of which purchases were fraudulent. ( This was at least the tenth call. ) So he took note of the problematic charges and STARTED ANOTHER 72 HOUR INVESTIGATION. 
10. He did issue another card finally, which I will close as soon as I extract my rewards points. However, he also shut down my online account. I need to login again when the new card comes for security reasons. The problem is that Capital One has taken so long that I have a payment due in two days. I asked the Capital One employee what to do and his suggestion was to pay off the {$15000.00} of fraudulent charges made by the thief, hoping that it would be refunded whenever the Fraud Department completes many more 72 hours reviews in which they"
Capital One,"I opened a credit card with capital one XX/XX/XXXX. For some reason, they blocked my card before I could use siting fraud/possible identify theft reasons. I submitted everything they needed to prove my identify including my social, drives license and bank statements."
Capital One,About 18 months or maybe a little longer Capital Once Credit Card informed me my account was restricted from further use. I have been in XXXX for last 4 years. I placed some employees on my card as authorized users. They wanted me to send copies of each authorized user 's driver license and social security card. I sent in that information via fax more then one occasion. After going back and forth trying to talk with the person who was authorized named XXXX. Who was the only one that could talk to me about my account and was never available when I called several times. I have asked several times to have my account closed. I have paid off these cards and do not use them. Instead I now have charges from the annual fee they charged me although I am unable to charge anything on these cards ; I find it very convenient they allow only their charges to be placed on the card.
Capital One,"I called capital one and informed them of a fraud that occurred while I was I. The XXXX XXXX at several gas stations and I do n't have a car in that country. They awarded my funds back in my account and then when I arrived back in the states an agent called me and told me that those charges are good because they are consecutive and there 's a pattern of the same charges. So I did n't argue and the only thing I said was thank you but I want them to send me the pattern or to anyone that shows that this is a pattern. Now she says if my card is not stolen there is no way for someone to use it. Now today as I 'm seating I. My house I got an email that my other capital one card was compromised and they stopped it and blocked it, so why could n't they do the same with the other card. They need to refund the fraud that occurred or I will keep fighting it it 's unfair."
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I made arrangements with the Capital One # XXXX to settle my outstanding debt in exchange for my payment the company agreed to remove the account and all references from their records and the XXXX credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ). As agreed I sent the checks and a letter to support that the payments were a part of our agreements. After 60 days I noticed that all three of my credit reports were not updated to reflect the agreements and the items are still being reported as delinquent accounts. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I mailed a letter to the creditor to request that they uphold our agreement and I sent a copy of the agreement letters, proof of delivery, bank check payment verification for all of the accounts listed. As XXXX XXXX, XXXX the creditor has not removed the account from my credit reports, they have not responded to any of the proof that I sent that the accounts were paid in full and per the written contracts the debt is still being illegally reported and they accepted the terms of our agreement by cashing the checks. Capital One withdrew the money as an ACH from my personal bank account although I sent them a check via US Postal mail and they received a physical check. My credit bureau disputes are being ignored and my consumer rights have been violated."
Capital One,"I am XXXX years old ; I was XXXX at the time of my wife 's death on XXXX XXXX, 2014. I contacted Capital One to close my wife 's account. I was not a co-applicant, but an authorized user. I was advised that I could then have a credit card and my wife 's account would be cancelled due to her death. However, her account was not closed, but they replaced me with my wife as the primary card holder. Capital One is now holding me accountable for XXXX of debt that should have been cancelled upon my wife 's death. I live on a fixed income and can not not pay. As an authorize user, I used the account thinking I had a clean slate ; I have tried to rectify this for two years. I have struggled to pay them {$400.00} each month, while waiting for resolution, that never came. They are not able to produce the original application, which will revealed that I was never a joint applicant and did not apply for this card. Please provide any assistance that you can."
Capital One,"The quicksilver capital one credit card sent me a letter for me to sign up for their credit card. 
I called their customer service number to see if I can be taken off their mailing list. They make it impossible to be removed from their mailing list if one has a XXXX with the USPS which I have. They asked me to leave my name on their recorded along with my address and phone number. They are obviously doing something wrong. They also are in business with XXXX."
Capital One,"I, XXXX XXXX, had Capital One credit card for few years. I had some balance transfer to capital one from other credit card companies and was paying the payments til I found out there are some extra and unknown charges in my account. It was about 2012 that I contacted Capital one to clarify the charges, they just promised to send me detailed information like any signed receipt/slips, but since then they never did except keep sending me all statements from beginning. The Capital One said they can not provide any transaction receipt to me. I was paying monthly fee and expected to receive any response about my inquiry but no response since then. I stop paying my payments and sent them letters and letters and inquired at least a copy of singed receipt by me but the Capital One ignored and said they believe all charges are correct. The Capital One sent my case to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX office and they filed case at court and got the judgment against me while they promised me to provide clear information about the charges and I was paying the minimum payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as they demanded. I have asked the Capital One and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX many times and disputed the charges but they Just send me letter that they verified the charges and found out all are correct. If they verify the charges and believe all charges are correct then why they can not send me any proof that charges were done by me. They asked me to provide them any documents that confirms otherwise. I am wonder how can I provide them documents that the charges are not mine.They have to send me proof of charges that have taken place by me. Although, I accept some charges are mine but not all. They do n't want to verify my charges with me and neither are working with me to solve the problem. They asked me to send the a statement for all charges that I confirm, which I did. But instead of checking my charges, The Capital One keep sending me pages and pages of statements without any receipts that was signed by me. I as an social security income receiver can not afford to hire an attorney so I need your help."
Capital One,I would Like to File a complaint on Capital one bank inference to reporting negative info to the major credit reporting agencies. I have sent them proof of payments and they still claim that my payments were late. Capital One is in violation on the FCRA.
Capital One,"I have been receiving harassing, threatening and XXXX threats telephone calls from Capital One Bank representatives in regards to a credit card account and debt of {$320.00} I do not owe. The account or debt do not belong to me. I have never applied for a Capital One Bank credit card. I am a victim of identity theft."
Capital One,"I have been forced to pay an annual fee of {$59.00} to Capital One for a credit card that I can not use due to its "" restricted '' status, for two years in a row. Capital One refuses to close my account because they say they can not verify my identity, even though I sent them, via email, all the official ID docs they asked for ( social security card, proof of address, drivers license ). They said they think I "" altered '' my own ID documents. Therefore, I 'm trapped in this cycle of trying to cancel my account, they refuse, they charge an annual fee for a product I ca n't even use."
Capital One,"I opened a secured credit card account with Capital One several years ago. As of XXXX XXXX, 2016 they held {$2800.00} of my money. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I closed the account and was assured by Capital One they would return my funds within XXXX billing cycles. Now, on XXXX XXXX, 2016 after XXXX seperate calls to Capital One, they still have not returned my money. They have lied to me every time."
Capital One,"The retail company switched the finance company which handled their company credit card. Through the process they discontinued my auto pay and did not notify me of the change although they had my contact information. They finally called me when my account was 32 days late to inform me my account was 30 days delinquent. I have since brought my account current and setup auto pay once again, but they refuse to remove the XXXX missed payment in my credit history, which was due their internal process errors and lack of proper notification"
Capital One,"I purchased a XXXX from an XXXX seller and it was not as advertised. The product was damaged. I contacted XXXX support and they asked me to return the item back to seller and I provided both seller and XXXX with a tracking number. The tracking number for the item I shipped back is XXXX XXXX. XXXX told me they could not refund me the amount owed. The product is {$1000.00} and I paid an additional {$89.00} to ship the item back to seller. I called Capitol One and asked them to dispute the charge of {$1000.00} after I gave them the appropriate documents by email and also submitted to them the tracking number for my return. Capitol One told me I had to wait 10 business days to receive a refund. I contacted them again after 10 business days and Capitol One told me to wait another 10 business days. I feel like I will not be getting my refund of {$1000.00} especially when the tracking number proves I returned the item back to seller on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and I am still not issued a refund. Capitol One is also charging me interest charges for the amount I am disputing as well."
Capital One,"Capital One Credit Card Company has wrongfully placed "" Account in Dispute '' Flags, in XXXX places on my credit report. 
The subject Mastercard Credit Card from Capital One is no longer in use. The card has been destroyed. 
Date of last usage of credit card : XXXX ( more than 8 years ago!!! ) Balance Owing : XXXX Amount Past Due : XXXX Payment Due : XXXX I contacted Capital One Credit Card Company by phone and demanded removal of "" Account in Dispute '' Flags. Multiple Capital One representatives told me that they have No financial records under my name and social security number. Despite this, they have not removed the "" Account in Dispute '' Flags from my credit report. The subject wrongful "" Account in Dispute '' Flags from Capital One are preventing my application for home mortgage refinancing from being approved. I demand immediate removal by Capital One of the wrongful "" Account in Dispute '' Flags from my credit report. I further demand that Capital One be assessed a {$500.00} punitive fine for their wrongful actions."
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, I received an email from Kohl 's, alerting me that my contact email address had been changed. There was a contact number where I could call if this was not a request I had initiated. I called, but what followed was over two hours of phone trees, endless hold times, and conversations to others who ultimately insisted I ignore it and that everything was fine. At one point, the gentleman who answered the call ( in another department ) could n't even verify that the address had been changed. 

I finally got to someone who informed me that a {$45.00} charge had been placed against my card, which I most definitely did not initiate, and it became evident to me that my account had been hacked and my privacy & identity had been compromised ( this was after the conversation with the man who had actually advised that I ignore the situation altogether ). Yet again, I tried to call -- this time their Fraud department -- but yet again, nobody was answering calls. I was unable to log in to the account online to dispute the charge, since my email address had been changed, so I had no options with respect to that, either. 

I was quite flustered, so I went up to an actual store location to simply close the card, in order to keep the fraudulent charges from coming in. Incredibly, at the store location itself, I was informed that I 'd have to call the corporate office to do so, which boggles my mind -- the account can be opened at the store, so why ca n't it be closed there, as well? 

At the end of this entire 3 hour fiasco, which now included a trip to a physical location, I have finally been able to successfully close my card, but I still have n't been able to contact anyone about the fraudulent charge, nor do I have any idea how many other fraudulent charges may be forthcoming, nor do I know the extent to which this possible case of identity theft has been extended."

Capital One,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied and received a Capital One credit card. When I applied I requested paperless statements. On my records the card had an 18-month no interest grace period. 
XX/XX/XXXX the card charged interest. Upon calling, it came to my attention that the company could not find the original terms and did not provide them to me. The company agreed to waive the interest for that month and find and send the terms. I just received the letter -- it has NO indication of the grace period and no mention of any terms. It looks like a regular account of their fees and other practices. 
I 'm at a loss as to how to proceed."
Capital One,"In looking over the documents you sent, not only did you skip over the main issue all together, but I can assure you, your research, which I appreciate, is not accurate. 
# 1, I do have proof that there was a card in the name of XXXX sent to my house on my account, I had a witness present. 
# 2 As well, I did not have a card with CAPITAL ONE that was not secure, card ending XXXX was indeed a secured card. We did not have any cards at the time that were not secured. 
# 3. On every account, I made my payments on time. And just to make mention of XXXX card, on card XXXX, the amount of deposit was XXXX for a XXXX credit. You were in possession of the XXXX security deposit and I made XXXX payment. The cards are not unlimited cards in that we went well over the XXXX balance. So If I had a XXXX deposit, and I made a payment of XXXX, Assuming that I did use the whole balance on the card, then the card balance would have only been {$170.00} in which the XXXX deposit should have taken care of that in which you would have owed me money. The issue, is all the cards, I see that I made a payment after, and each card had a secured deposit of well over half of the value of the card, and I must assure you that we did not have a XXXX card that was unsecured. 
# 4. I spoke to a FRAUD person on the phone, and I canceled the cards due to identity theft issues, not only was there a witness, in XXXX 2012, we had witnesses tell us that our CAPITAL ONE credit cards were being used by someone who had stolen the cards. A police report was made and you were notified. I have over hundred emails and faxes and several companies had tried to get a hold of you. 
# 5 Furthermore, on XXXX XXXX, 2012, we had our whole entire apartment robbed, and we were also beaten on the property, as well as our personal records, and such were taken as well as several of our CAPITAL ONE CARDS. So when we filled out the police reports we not only put the cards in the report, we faxed CAPITAL ONE a copy of this XX/XX/XXXX, and we had already closed the accounts, as I said, we talked to the FRAUD DEPARTMENT as I said. So, all the letters sent after the accounts were closed I am not sure I understand, we put down {$600.00} on the {$750.00} card ending XXXX, if you look at the date, it was XX/XX/XXXX, it was first card I got, it makes common sense that it would have been a secured card too as I did not qualify for any other card from CAPITAL ONE at the time. 
Card ending XXXX XXXX deposit, XXXX limit, and and I paid {$330.00} after closing card. So, XXXX plus XXXX is {$750.00} and the secured cards do n't go over the amount the card has limit for. So, {$930.00} you were in possession of for the {$750.00} card on close. And that is even if the bill was at {$750.00} at close I already explained card ending in XXXX, and the other XXXX follow. I made payments all the way through, I paid balances of a couple times a months on each card. And I made a payment a day or so after closing accounts in good faith bringing the account balances back, even though the cards were in others possessions and used without our consent, I still made the effort to CAPITAL ONE. 
On all XXXX cards, I put {$1900.00} secured deposit, and all together the cards only equaled a value of {$2500.00}. so, if at best, I was to have owed anything it would have been {$600.00}. But, as I looked at the statements, I noticed something peculiar, CAPITAL ONE re applied well over $! 000 's of dollars in purchase adjustments after the accounts were closed and I made my last payment."
Capital One,"Capital One allowed a charge of {$1200.00} to a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did not authorized such charge. Shared with Capital One copies of emails between me and XXXX XXXX of firing him in XXXX, 2016. Sent copies of what I paid XXXX XXXX on an agreement in XXXX XXXX. My last payment to XXXX XXXX was {$600.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2016 with an new agreement {$2200.00} if I use his services again. Total payments to XXXX was {$2800.00}. I contacted XXXX in XXXX XXXX and he would not respond to my calls or emails. Threaten firing on calls. XXXX XXXX does n't respond until its a month after XXXX/XXXX/2016 for new contract. XXXX XXXX did nothing for me during the time we were arguing about his services and his firing. XXXX XXXX XXXX we did n't have to meet for anything and I would have to do hearing myself for now. I figure I paid him already to at least come to the first court date. There was no negotiations with other parties. Already told XXXX in XXXX 2016 we was going to court no meeting up for anything. My financial situation changed and was trying to contact XXXX in XXXX to make known we needed to collect some money from my spouse since she took {$32000.00}. I ran out of money. It took XXXX XXXX 20 days to respond to my email in XXXX XXXX 2016. I was dissatisfied with his services on XXXX XXXX when he did n't contact me. He avoided my calls on purpose to get legal obligation but provided no service to me. This is for XXXX and new agreement for {$2200.00}. He was fired in XXXX in an email. He did no authorized work for me. His charges are made up and not agreed to by me. I believe Capital One already sided with XXXX because he is a lawyer no matter what proof I brought they sided with him I believe out of fear. He has no signature by me for these charges my dispute was started in XXXX I believe and so it 's no way he taught he still had a job. This dispute been going on for 5 months and they would rule in my favor but allow XXXX XXXX to present paper work at last minute when it does n't prove anything when you look at it. They told me the last time that his time ran out it was closed then they opened it again. They lied to me. I would have closed the account before if I knew they would allow him to reopen the case. They had their mind made up already. They sent me on XXXX XXXX their already made decision. But we was still disputing all till XXXX XXXX 2016. They had their mind already made up and just lied to me. They did n't even look at XXXX XXXX paper work. I confronted them on this. They just got fake reps to leave fake numbers like XXXX ext XXXX and a number XXXX not a working number. They stall with another rep when you call their real number have you on hold XXXX minutes to tell you same thing they said before. Told them this is fraud, was n't paying this debt they allowed to my card that was closed XXXX/XXXX/2016. Sent my last payment with the words final payment and that the account is now fraudulent wrote a letter faxed to them that I do n't owe them anything since it 's fraudulent. Recorded my conversation with their rep explaining they allowed a charge without my signed consent or agreement. XXXX XXXX has no signature for fake charges. Did n't use his services. Just few emails would n't take no time to read all them. XXXX of the people even said they do n't have a real fraud dept. all go disputes to handle. Tried to go to their fraud dept. their excuse they had to get info from disputes. But really fraud is not handling the case always forwarding it to disputes dept."
Capital One,"In XXXX 2016, my identity was stolen. A Capitol One credit card was opened in my name and sent to my old address of 20 years ago. Capitol One was alerted and was supposed to take the hard credit inquiry off my report and cancel the credit card. A letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 stated that they would remove this account. When the hard credit report was not removed as of XXXX XXXX, I called and got the run around. They said it would be taken off in 60-90 days. I called again XXXX XXXX as it was still not off. Again, was told 60-90 days. I believe the law states 30 days to remove unauthorized inquiries. They also did not have my permission for the inquiry. As of XXXX XXXX, 2016, the hard credit inquiry is still on my credit report. I also feel Capitol One was negligent in opening the account to begin with as I already had a Capitol One account with my current address in Georgia. This should have been a red flag and I should have been contacted by the fraud department before it was issued. If I had lost my card, they would not send it to a different address. Capitol One has not been very helpful in resolving this issue, so am contacting you in hopes of having the unauthorized hard credit check removed from my credit reports. It is currently on all the reports. A fraud file was opened at the XXXX County Sheriff 's department. A freeze and fraud alert was put on all my credit accounts. I was the one that caught the fraud and not Capitol One."
Capital One,i am writing to you about a dispute i filed with my capital one card.i paid a company XXXX on XXXX XXXX the company name is XXXX.i was issued a credit on XXXX XXXX iwas told there would be no refund.the company sent in the contract i signed as i knew they would.capitol one sent me a form letter about a billing dispute which is not how i wanted to dispute the charge.the charge was disputed as services not rendered or provided to me.they took way more money from me than just this on several of my credit cards.capital one never even gave me the opportunity to answer what XXXX sent in.i tried on several occasions to talk to capital one but it seems nobody would listen.this company also promised me a grant which i also found out was fraud.i am the victim and the customer but capital still lets them operate with a merchant account to commit fraud.why do they not have to prove what they did for such a ridiculous amount.i do not feel capital one even did an ounce of investigating.
Capital One,My credit card information has not been updated for a XXXX Capital one account
Capital One,"I was in a non-profit credit management program. Each month I paid a consolidator {$700.00} and they distributed it to my creditors each month. The program has been ongoing since XXXX 2013 until present. One of the creditors was Capital One ( account number ending in XXXX ). During that time period My credit reports show XXXX payments 30 or more days past due for this account while there is no problem with the other credit accounts. The due date for the Capital One account is the XXXX of each month. I obtained electronic records from my credit management company showing that each month funds were always transferred to Capital One electronically within 30 days of the due date. In XXXX cases a double payment was made the following month when a payment was missed, but in these cases the double payment was still within 30 days of the due date the month before and so no payments were 30 or more days past due. I discussed with Capital One representatives 4 times by phone and they refused to fix it. I sent them the electronic records ( attached ), but they still refused to do anything even with the undisputable evidence. I do not think they have anything to gain from this. They are just too lazy to make any effort to fix their mistake. I think this is all electronic and it is not easy to fix and so they just ignore me. This account corresponds to 80 % of my late payments in this period and I have been denied credit due to these incorrect records. My position is that as a reporter of credit information to the bureas the law requires them to correct information when they have clear evidence it is incorrect. By not honoring their obligations as a credit information reporter they are causing financial damage to me. I want them to fix this so that I am not further damaged by their mistakes."
Capital One,"1. Since XXXX XXXX, I have disputed an unauthorized charge with Capital One for {$630.00} ( which has now increased to {$870.00} with interest ). 
2. The transaction was initiated by a local mover, XXXX XXXX XXXX Maryland. 
3. The mover was given my credit card number to "" hold '' my spot for a specific moving date. ( XXXX ). 
4. XXXX provided a quote but no bill of lading, as they are required to do. They provided only a quote, which says on page XXXX XXXX attached ) : a. "" Payment type : Balance due to be paid in cash only, at destination before relinquish goods and values. '' ( attached ) 5. Upon conclusion of the move on XXXX, I paid the XXXX daylaborers in cash -- and I even withdrew extra ( Bank verification attached. ) so that I could include tips. 
6. I asked for a receipt, which they are required to provided, and they refused to give me one. I just wanted them to leave, so I let it go. As a single mother, it is intimidating and scary to have XXXX XXXX and their XXXX day helpers demanding payment and not leaving until they were paid. 
7. After the movers departed, XXXX XXXX charged my CapOne card again -- so I paid twice. 
8. I reported it immediately to Cap One. No due diligence was conducted as required by FCRA. 
a. CapOne ignored the papers and receipts sent previously. 
b. Since then, I have sent numerous letters and called many times to request proof that due diligence was conducted. They offered NO proof the charge was authorized!! 
c. When I call CapOne -- there is no one I can speak to about this account to resolve the issue. The call center staff have said the issue is too dated and ca n't help me. Each time I wrote a letter, they wrote back and said the account is in dispute as recently as XXXX XXXX, but nothing has been resolved. 
d. I 've sent the baclground information to them five or six different times to date. 
9. Because of CapOne 's negligence to conduct a thorough investigation, my credit has been impacted. 
10. My FICO in XXXX XXXX was over XXXX and because CapOne has now placed this outstanding amount in collections, my FICO is below XXXX. 
11. Now the collector is taking me to court and incurred legal fees."
Capital One,"XXXX, Capital One ( XXXX accounts ), XXXX XXXX are not reporting my payments. I have attached statements"
Capital One,I have XXXX credit card accounts with Capitol One Bank for my company XXXX XXXX. I have paid XXXX of my account balances in full for the account ending in XXXX and the account ending in XXXX. Capitol One has official documentation related to my business and yet they have restricted access to both accounts without proper notice.
Capital One,"Account number : XXXX I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 30 days past due XXXX, XXXX I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Capital One,I over paid this credit card by {$350.00} when paying it off and they tell me after I contacted them that I can expect a refund check within 60 -90 days. This is usury. If I am even one day late in payment I get hit with interest and late payment fees yet they get to keep my money for up to 90 days! This is unacceptable.
Capital One,"When I first applied for my Capital One card, I was told that if I 'd made timely payments on it for 6 months, I would be eligible for a credit limit increase. After making 6 months of timely payments, I saw no increase. I was XXXX for training with the XXXX XXXX soon thereafter, and missed a payment deadline ( as I had no access to a cell phone or internet device ). I contacted a member of my XXXX XXXX XXXX ( financial assistance ), who relayed my concerns to Capital One. It was my assumption that Capital One would understand my circumstances ( that my inability to pay was due to no fault of my own ), and reflect this information on my credit score, after I had paid my balance. Upon paying my balance, my credit score reflects XXXX late payment in XXXX, similar to as if I had simply not cared about paying for my credit card statement. My credit score suffered. 

In early XXXX, I authorized an auto-bill pay on this Capital One card. I was in the process of receiving a new debit card from XXXX XXXX when my payment was due for Capital One. My payment was declined and bounced back to Capital One, who never informed me that my payment had bounced. When I saw twice my credit limit being charged for next month 's bill, I sought to dispute the transaction. Only after ( two or three months later ) I had gone to the physical branch, did they tell me my payment had not cleared and that I was being assessed two months worth of credit card debt. I then paid, but after my credit score dropped significantly."
Capital One,In XX/XX/XXXX my credit card was reported over the spending limit and i lost XXXX points on credit score the problem is that i never went over my limit and call into Captial One and it was investagated 3 times and they came back and said yes it was an error on there part and could n't correct it for up to 60-90days ... I was in the process of buying my house for my children and i and should not be punish by losing my house and loan because of an error on there part. I call for 3days and keep getting the run around this is not best practices at all not to mention that they didnt report me in XX/XX/XXXX at all and had to update that information on XX/XX/XXXX. Im truly upset and surprise that a company could do this and nothing be done to fix my problem ASAP
Capital One,"Capital One is FRAUD! I have contacted them in the XXXX, MD Branch & Written letters! 
I had theft on all my capital one credit cards- Business & Personal were taken and used XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX exp XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX exp XXXX now the Business was removed from my credit report after contacting you but personal is reporting false!!!! I have also paid off my auto loan with them to get rid of capital one completely from my life since they careless to help me! That reports still owed! I do not trust them and they 're reporting false on my credit reports! They closed an active Justice account that was current and then reported that as well. I want them to remove the false reporting and fix the situation and help me! They charged XXXX in fees on a checking account that was compromised too, we need to further investigate them I bet others are taken advantage of too!"
Capital One,Capital One has ran my credit several times without my permission which has affected my credit due to the inquiry. I have at no time applied for or had an account with Capital One. I have written them on several occasions stating this and requesting removal of the inquiry yet they refuse to remove it and each time send me back an automated response about them having access to my credit file for promotional purposes. Well that is a lie because I have restricted and opted out of all credit card screenings. This is my last attempt for Capital One to remove the inquiries before I have to seek further action.
Capital One,"orchard card was bought by capital one. on XXXX XXXX, i paid both my regular capital one acct. and the that was originally orchard. the regular capital one they automatically closed. the orchard one, they did not. i do not have a valid credit card for this account. i was just alerted by credit monitoring that they have reported me as deliquent. it seems they "" decided '' not to close this account in order to charge me an annual fee on XX/XX/XXXX, have now charged me a late fee, interest on it, another late fee and more interest. i was not aware the original card had an annual fee. i was not sent a card to use, so why would i get charged an annual fee. i also have not received any bills from there or an email to let me know that i had a balance. Very unfair for them to close the XXXX acct. they could n't charge me a fee for and leave the open the other, then not bill me and keep charging me late fees and interest, given the fact that i do not possess a valid card and can not charge on it myself. 
i do not have the card no, acct no. according to credit report is XXXX"
Capital One,"I opened a Capital One Credit Card account ( Ending # XXXX ) in XXXX XXXX, I then had unexpected medical bills in the amount of {$90000.00}, I unfortunately had to file Chapter XXXX bankruptcy on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, It was discharged XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I submitted all the necessary paperwork to Capital One but am still being billed, have been paying them since XXXX, Am I entitled to monies spent refunded?"
Capital One,"Capital One has a policy of making it as difficult as possible for consumers to dispute charges, most likely because the merchant is being compensated in some manner or other for doing so. Aside from not allowing consumers to provide any details regarding their disputes in Capital One 's online dispute forms or to submit messages electronically -- either securely through their online accounts ( a feature which existed previously but has recently been eliminated by Capital One ) or via email -- the merchant has a policy of both requiring supporting documentation prior to submitting a claim and also permanently rescinding credit issued in connection with claims as soon as said claims are disputed by the merchants in question without giving consumers a chance to rebut the merchants ' response. 

On XXXX I submitted a dispute ( Case # : XXXX ) in connection with a charge for {$2000.00} from XXXX/XXXX/2016 against an attorney who had actively assisted the State of Florida in retaliating against me for trying to call attention to abuses which the State of Florida systematically inundates HUD Programs with in order to undermine the Civil Rights Act, made possible by the criminally unethical practice of allowing County Judges to adjudicate landlord-tenant disputes involving HUD rules without being qualified or authorized to do so -- even in circumstances where County Judges are specifically requested to disqualify themselves from such cases because of the financial ties which all County Judges must have to any landlords who participate in HUD 's programs within any Municipality wherein HUD 's Programs are not fully privatized. Despite the vast amounts of evidence I sent in via fax detailing at great length the unethical conduct of the attorney, Capital One rescinded the credit issued in connection with my dispute on XXXX/XXXX/2016, immediately after the attorney disputed my claim. 

On XXXX I submitted another dispute ( Case # : XXXX ) in the amount of {$310.00} against XXXX XXXX for the abuse I was deliberately subjected to during a XXXX/XXXX/2016 flight from Florida to Georgia for no other reason than being a low-income minority. Before even submitting my claim to the merchant, Capital One demanded supporting documentation, subsequent to which the credit issued in connection with my claim was rescinded."
Capital One,"I have made attempt to contact Capital One for over a year in regards to my account. I spoke to a representative a few months back and asked her to send me the information they used to report my account as a charge off to the credit bureau. Instead of sending me the information, they sent me a form to fill out. I sent the form back twice and they never sent me the information. They have yet to verify the information that is reporting on my credit."
Capital One,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 30 days late as of XXXX 2014 I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Capital One,"Last year I was solicited for a bumper to bumper warranty product from what turned out to be XXXX different companies that were both charging me for an un necessary warranty on a car I am leasing that has a full factory warranty in place. 
I would like a refund as both companies mis represented the facts to me claiming that I could n't use the other and ended up both charging my credit card. 
I eventually changed the Capital One Card number to avoid additional charges. 

I would like assistance in obtaining refunds from these XXXX companies who I feel turned out to be scam.

Capital One,"I have a Capital One credit card. I paid off my entire monthly balance prior to the due date, yet I was hit with an interest charge. The company said it was practice for interest to be charged unless the card balance was paid off for two consecutive months. It does n't seem appropriate to be charged interest on top of prior principal and interest after the card was paid off during the current cycle."
Capital One,"Hello CapitalOne Team, Hopefully you will be able to assist in treating me like a valued and respected customer. I have had your cards in excess of a year +. 
XXXX card, I opened as a Secured card to help in rebuilding my credit and the other card, a Quicksilver - was a regular approved CL. 
Recently I had been asking about increasing my limits to more respectable limits and have only been told that : 1, I ca n't increase limits on secured cards ; that there is no longer a way to make deposits to the program. That only Capital One Proactively reviews accounts for good history and determines that a customer should be rewarded with additional money on the card account. That 's not a fair trade off to help improve ones position. 
2, that limits are granted every 5-6 months. 
Since I have opened these card accounts, I have been able to successfully improve my credit position, and have since seen approvals with other major banks, being XXXX and XXXX. 
My credit lines with these banks, have doubled/tripled what Capital one would even consider me for. Therefore my loyalty lies with using their cards over my CapitalOne cards, since the flexibility in those lines appeal to me more. 
I would like to have CapitalOne share in my sending and be able to be used more actively, but I ca n't do this with toy limits. 
I am requesting that you Proactively review my Secured-Line and increase that balance substantially, as well as my QuickSilver line. I would like a respectable amount of credit to be granted immediately."
Capital One,"As of XXXX/XXXX/15, Capital One Bank issued a XXXX ( Cancellation of Debt ) to me for an old credit card account that they had charged off. I claimed this income on my 2015 XXXX and paid taxes on the amount. However, Capital One continues to report a balance owed on that account as well as actively reporting the account. I have requested of them to update this information and not only have they claimed the amount is correct, they have now entered a dispute status on my credit report for something that is THEIR error. I have attached a copy of my credit report showing the balance still reporting, my letter to Capital One asking them to update my account, a copy of the XXXX clearly showing the account number and a copy of the response letter that I received from Capital One. I am not disputing the validity of the account from the past but do not feel that they have the right to continue to punish me and destroy my credit for something that I have paid income taxes on and they have written off as bad debt. They are still attempting to collect on this debt which I am refusing to pay because I have already had to pay taxes on this amount for income, why would I pay them as well?"

Capital One,Capital one opened up this new credit card in my name and ever since I put in XXXX fraud claim they close this account with no warrant or no issue I had put in a dispute for not receiving goods and they called them a credit line and a hold me responsible for a balance that I agree is mine but shut my whole car down they are repercussion on me because I reported XXXX cars that were not mine and now they shut this car down which I never reported was not mine this account is not fraudulent like the other XXXX by capital one is a terrible company and I will contact my attorney to see why they shut my card down that I support my XXXX-year-old grandmother on for her medication capital one are thieves that just shut your car down without notice I should n't have to pay for goods that I never received I want this investigated to the highest level
Capital One,"Roughly 3 months ago I set up our Kohl 's "" credit '' card ( I believe they claim to be something else for legal purposes ) for automatic payment on their website. Over the last 3 days my wife has received a call a day from a computer claiming to be Kohl 's and insisting that she enter part of her social security number. This of course is the *definition* of a fraudulent call, compounded by the fact that Kohl 's POS systems were very recently broken into and information stolen. When my wife called to alert them to these robocalls, it turns out that these calls were to notify us that our card was past due, with a {$25.00} fee etc. After bullying my way through customer service ( after the XXXXline in XXXX told me that the XXXX line would refuse to take my call ), the late fee was scrubbed, the balance paid off, and the account closed permanently. 

My complaint is twofold : 1 ) Their autopay system silently failed to operate, and while talking with customer "" service '' I found that the website shows no hint of autopay even existing. The agent claimed that if the account is in arrears it wo n't allow changes to autopay, but that 's very different from the autopay being completely scrubbed from the site. 
2 ) Their automated phone system requires the customer to enter part of their social security number over an unsecured channel. This "" standard practice '' of theirs is the worst possible method, as it sounds like a fraudulent call. I strongly suspect they actually *want* it to sound like fraud so people will ignore it and end up with even more late fees. The industry-standard method is to tell the customer to call back at a given number, or best case tell the customer to "" call the number on the back of your card '' because a fraudulent call can just as easily give a fraudulent call-back number. 

The account in question is permanently closed ( I have had more trouble with this XXXX card than with the sum of all other cards I 've ever had ), but their practices live on and they give no indication that they are willing to correct them. "" Passing your concerns along '' is the polite way of saying "" stuff it '', thus my formal complaint with an entity that may have some power to actually do something about it."
Capital One,Capital One closed my credit card account without my permission. I recieved a call today saying someone called previously and requested my account to be closed. I do not understand why my account would be closed without my permission and without contacting me. The lady I talked to said she was calling to clarify why it was closed and kept saying I requested it to be close. I told her that was not the case and that I did not request the account to be closed but she would not listen to what I was telling her and just kept repeating that I had requested the account be closed which of course I did not. I could not seem to get her to understand this and she eventually hung up on me. I have never seen customer service like this. I do not appreciate Capital One taking liberties with my card and closing it without my permission.
Capital One,"Capital One Credit Card has continuously denied my requests for a credit limit increase, even though I have great payment history with the card. I submitted a previous complaint last year ( XXXX ), after they denied my requests for 1.5 to 2 years. THe last denial reason I received was that my average monthly payment was too low, but my monthly payment has averaged $ XXXX/month. I typically send $ XXXX- {$100.00} a month to cover y payment. I feel Capital One is being misleading to its customers. I opened this account to help rebuild my credit, but if you do not allow limit increases, how is that possible?"
Capital One,"I made a {$500.00} payment to my daughter 's capital one credit card on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I told the rep that I wanted it to be a surprise. When my daughter saw the payment reflected on her credit card, she had it returned to sender on XXXX XXXX, 2016 because she did n't know where the payment came from! When I spoke to her again that weekend, she said she had it returned on XXXX XXXX, 2016 because she did n't know where it came from. Anyway, I called capital one on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and spoke with a rep named XXXX. He said it takes XXXX calendar days for the "" wait period '' and another 3 working days for accounting to return it to me account. Therefore, my {$500.00} should have been back last XXXX XXXX, 2016. I called capital one again on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and spoke to a rep named XXXX. XXXX said she can not help me without my daughter 's permission and referred me to her supervisor, XXXX, with ID # XXXX. XXXX said she can not help me without my daughter 's permission so I gave her my daughter 's phone number. After having me wait about 30 to 45 minutes, XXXX told me that she can have my {$500.00} back to my debit card in 3 business days which is XXXX XXXX, 2016, according to XXXX. When I called on XXXX XXXX, XXXX did not give me the excuse of having to have authorization from my daughter ; and besides the {$500.00} does not belong to my daughter. All information is in the system of capital one, but XXXX and XXXX chose to give me a difficult time and the run around. Definitely POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! This makes me think that capital one is trying to use MY MONEY FOR THERE ADVANTAGE because of people you put on the phone like XXXX and XXXX."
Capital One,"I was contacted my someone from capital one just as my o % promo period was ending, He told me that because i make more then the minimum monthly payments and as long as continue to make my payment on time that they were going to extend the o % promo to me as well as raise my credit limit. I was skeptical so afterwards i call customer support to confirm this and they informed me that i was good to go, As lone as i do n't do cash advance. 
Well not exactly i go paperless and i just reviewed my account on line and im being charged 23 % interest now."
Capital One,"Kohls Credit Card Department offered me an option to keep my credit account which was past due open, they stated through every communication they were Kohls department store. In XXXX of last year they convinced me to go into a payment arrangement for XXXX months at which time it would catch the account up and all late payments would be removed from the account. After the last payment was made I continued to receive calls and informed them the arrangement that had been made with their agents and was informed that the card was closed and that I could try and reapply but otherwise it would remain closed, which was not what i had originally agreed upon when i made the arrangement with them. I told them before I would even consider anything else I wanted a bill, which i never received. Now they are harassing me saying the bill is over the amount i had already was supposed to have paid off because they added late fees yet again because they have not sent a bill. So now I was conned into going into an agreement with them which i honored to get use of my account back only to have been lied to and the account closed, and they continue to harrass me on my private cell line after being informed to cease and desist."
Capital One,"I had a Capital One credit card back in 2000 or so. I got rid of it because it was not affordable anymore. I was contacted by the bank once or twice. I paid what I could. They, in turn, waited 19 years and now are garnishing my check for about XXXX % of the gross. I thought the limit was XXXX % of the disposable income. So now my wife and I can not pay our rent on time, it is hard to make car payments, get groceries, etc. They have put us in a position where we can not afford to live in XXXX County and have nowhere else to go. My wife is disabled and I am her caregiver. I need to know if you can help me and if any complaints related to this one have been filed with you."
Capital One,I have asked Capital One to cancel a credit card I had with them months ago. They still will not close out the card.
Capital One,"I am an victim of ID theft my information was stolen and I have multiple problem because of this, I am dispute an account with capitol one card I se I send the a letter stated them to validate the debit and the only thing they send me back was statement, I spoke with a lady in the fraud department on XX/XX/2016 by the name XXXX stated that the account is my bea because of my phone number, I ask her to send me a copy of the credit, I do applicant and she could n't, and no response, I send over police report to capital one and a letter asking validate the debit and no help"

Capital One,"Purchased merchandise on XXXX from XXXX in the amount of {$750.00}. Merchandise came damaged. I contacted XXXX on XXXX and XXXX ( to remind them ) and reported the damage and asked to be refunded. XXXX did not pick up the merchandise. I disputed the charge with Capital One on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Capital One reversed the charge on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The merchant sent a print out of the order showing the order number, purchase date, items and quantities purchased. They further sent a print off from XXXX showing the damaged merchandise delivered. And finally they sent a credit card transaction log showing the details of the charge being authorized and approved. The merchant provided no rebuttal or repsonse to why they did not pick up the damaged merchandise or if they even attempted to pick up the damaged merchandise. Nor did the merchant refute that I had contacted them stating the merchandise was damaged. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX Capital One writes me and stated that the merchant provided the above documentation thus they were rebilling my account {$750.00}. 

Capital One has violated Federal Law and owes me a penalty of {$1000.00}. 

My complaint pertains to the handling of my dispute under the XXXX, Truth in Lending, Regulation Z and applicable case law. The facts in this case are rather simple. I ordered merchandise. The merchandise came damaged. I contacted the merchant rejecting the merchandise by stating it is damaged and requesting the merchant to pick it up. The merchant agreed to pick it up and credit but did not. This same scenerio has been reviewed in the courts as far back as XXXX. Capital One knows this but is not following established law. 
In this case Capital One ignored the law and made me go beyond what was required by physcially sending back the merchandise. All while Capital One rebilled my account and demanded payment. A clear violation of Federal Law. 

See XXXX v. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Missouri Supreme Court applying Truth in Lending, Fair Credit Billing Acts and Regulation Z. 

XXXX XXXX argued that XXXX did not properly reject the ceiling fan because he did not return it. The court disagreed saying : "" a buyer that rescinds the contract and holds the merchandise as bailee for the seller is not liable for the sale price. UCC Section 400.2-602 ( XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX. A buyer has no further obligations with regard to goods it has rejected. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX citing section 400.2-602 ( 2 ) ). The seller bears the cost of return delivery. '' This case is applying the Uniform Commercial Code of which is the same in all states. 

In my case I clearly told Capital One that I had rejected the damaged merchandise and that the seller was free to pick it up. At the time that I informed the merchant that the merchandise was damaged and I wanted it picked up I had no further obligation. The merchant did not respond my saying they attempted to pick up the merchandise or that I refused to allow them to pick up the merchandise. With this, Capital One placed the charge back on my account and demanded payment. 

This is a clear violation of law. Capital One owes me a penalty of {$1000.00}. XXXX XXXX v XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX."
Capital One,"When I opened my credit card account I maintained an impeccable record. I even got a car loan with the same bank and paid off the loan with no late payments. Unfortunately, I became unemployed and homeless and did not have an income to pay my card payments. The card was closed and the account balance more than doubled with fees. Now that I am employed again, I researched a contact number for the bank who issued the credit card and I called them to find out the balance and if I could make payment arrangements. I talked to a manager who said they would make a one time adjustment to the balance and they gave me the total. I asked if I paid the balance would they contact the credit agencies stating the account was paid in full. I was told, "" Yes. '' I asked if they could send me a letter to that effect and they said they would. I received a letter shortly after thanking me for agreeing to pay the balance by such and such a date. At no time in our conversation on the phone did the manager ever mention a date I had to pay the account by nor did I agree to pay by a certain date. I was told on the phone that once I paid the balance they would wait 22 days to make sure the funds cleared then they would contact the credit bureaus saying the account was paid. Now the letter was stating I had roughly 10 days to pay the lowered amount agreed upon or the original balance would be back in force. I sacrificed my paycheck and made sure I had called them to pay over the phone thinkng I could use my debit card. After waiting an extended amount of time on hold, I finally got through to a representative who informed me they do n't take payments via debit cards ; it had to be a credit card or check by phone. I do n't use checks so I had to get the routing and account number in order to proceed. I got the information and called the bank back. Again, it was a long hold time before speaking with a representative. I gave her my information and the payment went through. A few days later, I received another letter from the same manager who I had been dealing with and the letter states, "" Thank you for your recent payment .... We credited this amount to your Capital ONe account referenced above on XXXX XXXX, 2016. 

If you have nay questions, please give us a call. If a thrid-party agency is servicing your account, your call will be automatically routed to them. '' Sincerely, XXXX XXXX, Account Manager The letter shows I still have a balance on the account which is not what we agreed to. XXXX XXXX said over the phone he was reducing the balance and in his first letter to me he said that also. Now that he received the money requested - he is changing my account balance back to the original amount."
Capital One,"I was contacted via email by Capitol One at XXXX PDT on XXXX/XXXX/16 regarding potential fraudulent charges. In fact, they were in the amounts of {$900.00}, {$950.00}, and {$8.00}, which maxed out the limit of the master card. After filing the necessary information with Capitol One, they credited the account for the charges plus all associated fees. But, they refused to release the available credit pending the investigation up to 90 days. 

So basically, I 'm being punished for fraud and have XXXX available funds to the card for 90 days. Given that I have contacted the businesses involved, gotten the suspects physical description from a business and subsequently filed a police report, spoken to multiple police agencies where the fraud occurred, filed this report ; I do n't see why I 'm being punished for this fraud."
Capital One,"On XXXX/XXXX/16 I went to XXXX XXXX to purchase an ink cartridge. I used my credit card and XXXX XXXX billed me {$76.00} cents. Approximately 30 minutes later I returned the item, the same day, because my husband has a XXXX XXXX card and we decided to use it. XXXX XXXX gave me a refund receipt showing the item returned and monies refunded to the card. Capital One, the owner of the credit card I initially used sent me a bill in XXXX 2016, stating I was billed a second time by XXXX XXXX and must pay {$76.00}. I told them I did not purchase the item with their card a second time and that I will be contacting XXXX XXXX. I went back to XXXX XXXX and they were able to run the Capital One card and saw that they did not charge me a second time for the ink cartridge. They gave me duplicate receipts of the purchase and return/refund on XXXX/XXXX/16 and I sent copies to Capital One to show as proof that I never purchased the item a second time and that it was returned and the card was refunded. Capital One sent me a letter stating that the receipts were not enough and they are still going to charge me and the case is closed. They continue to bill my account this erroneous charge and fail to show any proof of a second charge from their end. At least XXXX XXXX was able to run the card and see that they did not charge a second time. I have sent letters to Capital One including their corporate headquarters and they refuse to remove the charge from my statement. I am a simple XXXX employee and {$76.00} means a lot to me and I can not afford to pay for something that I did not purchase and they refuse to do anything to remove the charge, even though XXXX XXXX insist they did not charge my card and I could see from their report they did not. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. Kind regards."
Capital One,"I had a balance on my account. I paid it off in full.Twice in one month. I ran my card up XXXX, paid it off. ran it up again XXXX, paid it off. However, I still got interest. Now, the statement says, if paid off before the due date no interest accrued. However, I still received an interest charge."
Capital One,"I applied for a secured credit card with Capital One. I was approved and I initiated a deposit much higher than requested for a larger line. During the deposit process, their system went down and when it came back up it did n't confirm that the deposit had gone through, so I started over and did the whole process again. This time it gave me confirmation and I thought all was fine. Well, come to find out after the fact, the first deposit went through so they had it twice. Should n't be a big deal, right? Wrong ... .I contacted them and told them of the issue and was told that once they have the funds they ca n't return them if I want the card. The said if I wanted the funds back I 'd either have to totally cancel the card or I could go to my bank and put a stop payment on XXXX of the deposits. So, that 's what I did ... I put a stop payment on XXXX of the deposits. Instead of correcting the situation it only made it worse. When I received the card, I called the number on the front to activate it and was immediately kicked over to the fraud department. They proceeded to tell me that there was now a problem with the card because of XXXX of the deposits being returned. I informed them that was what I was instructed to do. They said that someone in the backroom was handling it and they would send them an e-mail to call me. I never received a call so after a few days I called again and got the same story but asked to speak to a supervisor. He said there was nothing he could do that it was being investigated by the "" magical '' back room '' and they would contact me. Again, no contact other than a letter stating my credit card line had been decreased in half because of a partial return of deposit which was correct. Since I received that letter I thought all was fine ... .wrong. I activated the card and tried to use it and was declined. I called Capital One and they informed me the account was closed. Huh ... what? so I asked to speak to a supervisor and after going round and round with her for 30 minutes was told they had sent my other deposit back and the account was closed. I told her I had n't received the funds back which she confirm with Capital One bank. I told her all I wanted was a credit card so transfer my information to a new account and take the deposit again. She told me that could only be decided by the "" back room '' and they would have to call me. XXXX from the supposed "" back room '' called back 3 days later and said there was nothing that can be done and if I wanted a new account that I could apply. That sent me into a rage ... I told her I did n't want another inquiry on my account and she said that 's the way they process .... ( IT 'S A SECURED CARD ) where 's the risk anyway? She proceeded to tell me this was not their mistake and that I caused the whole incident by stopping a payment on XXXX of the unauthorized deposit debits. What a XXXX that 's the instructions they have given me ... I asked to speak to someone over her and she refused stating she did n't have to give me anyone 's name to discuss this with. She kept telling me to be professional which only incited me more as she kept reading her script. So now, I have no credit card and I have yet to receive my XXXX deposit back which they mailed. Why would they mail it when I bank with them? They act like they 're not part of the same organization. These people are arrogant, condescending, and have no clue how to rectify a situation that was caused by them twice, once with their system going down and then the second time when they told me to put a stop payment on XXXX of them. If you 're looking for a secured credit card then avoid these folks."
Capital One,Somebody took out my money {$9700.00} from my business bank last week XXXX/XXXX/2016 without my permission.
Capital One,"after a wrongful eviction that interfered with my employment XXXX XXXX, XXXX, etc. lawsuit I was living in a third rate hotel as I worked as a pro se litigant. I took out a Capital One credit card because they approached me with a mail. I had a pre-authorization for credit. Little did I know that within a few months the terms and conditions would change. I was offered the opportunity to opt-out. I did, but it was never recognized. The time period was about XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. The account number is MasterCard Platinum XXXX. 

I had an overcharge of {$0.00} while on Social Security Benefits and I was about XXXX XXXX XXXX, unemployed albeit for acting as a non-attorney in the Federal Court, XXXX vs. State of California, et al, XXXX, published at XXXX vs. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, et al, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, foot note XXXX. 

I tried to make sense out of the overcharge saying I was protection under regulation Z, Truth in Lending Act, finance charges were illegal. But the credit was sold, and the debt buyer has n't let me off the hook. This is illegal under the FCPA, etc. Dodd Frank Act. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, 2010, I have a statement for {$1300.00} which has grown since accruing finance charges. Please permanently remove this credit reporting and balance once and for all and compensate me for the violation three times what they say I owe, restore my credit in full, under the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. Constitution, and pay me attorney fees, and post-interest, any judicial reward I am entitled to for the humiliation of a weaponized shame in credit agency reports with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. Also realize I am now XXXX years old, still waiting for a final review in my XXXX, and XXXX litigations because the wrong agency sent out the right to sue letter and determination for a state employee ( EEOC instead of DOJ ). I am still under severe poverty of only Social Security Benefits and Food Stamps. They claim the APR is 21.150 %. I never agreed to the debt buyer. They have no proof of indebtedness on an old debt sold and resold over the time period."
Capital One,Capital one is reporting a 30 days late payment from 2 years ago on my credit reports. This is incorrect as I never had a 30 day late payment. It is also showing in the potentially negative on my reports but showing paid as agreed. This account should be showing in accounts that are saitsfactory. Having this incorrect information reporting on my reports is causing me difficutly in obtaining substantial credit as it is reflecting negatively on my credit score. I have contacted capital one several times in requesting that this information be corrected and updated. I was told that it would be corrected that was month 's ago. I just checked my credit reports and it is still not corrected. I am submitting this complaint because I do n't seem to be getting anywhere with capital one. I have never been late in paying this credit card especially more than 30 days and it is from 2 years ago.
Capital One,"My credit card got unauthorized use about {$1800.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16 and I found it by myself at the end of XXXX. It looked a typical fraud case through non existing website and described as I spend purchasing a service, not products. Normally, this kind of suspicious spending is found by credit card company by monitoring my usage but they did not. I called the credit card company to dispute the amount and once they credited the amount. But after a month later, they reapplied the amount to me after their investigation. I do n't understand the result. Because initial purchasing was done in Florida and credit card transaction was done though a processing company in XXXX XXXX. They gave me a report to show purchasing IP address but it was not mine and even not in XXXX XXXX where I live/work in. A couple of days later from I received the report from the credit card company, I received a letter from XXXX, a computer company. I have purchased a tablet through their official online shop. They said that they had been hacked ( attacked ) by a third party and lost customers information including credit card numbers, addresses names etc. I used that credit card to purchase and the date of purchase was impact exactly XXXX got attacked. I have written a letter to explain the situation to the credit card company attached XXXX letter and asked again to dispute the amount they reapplied. It has been more than a month but the credit card company does not reply me and they keep quiet but putting the amount on my account with APR. I have paid the amount I spent but I have not paid the amount unauthorized use because it is not my responsibility. I am 100 % innocent, I have never used that big amount though internet. Now I have no idea what I should do and who I can ask to help or resolve this problem. I really need your help."
Capital One,"TRANSACTIONS FOR XXXX XXXX # XXXX www.capitalone.com/XXXX The credit card company online notification was not reached via e-mail thus causing the account to be past due for over 30 days, when credit monitoring alert advised of such inquiry it was handle in the same day paid in full. I have called the credit card company and they have reversed the late dues and agreed to reverse the bad inquiry however they say the can only inform credit bureau they can not reverse the inquiry, which has caused the credit bureaus to lower score by XXXX points which sounds quite substancial and incorrect. 

Please remove bad inquiry as agreed by the credit card company"
Capital One,"I will be filing criminal charges against CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD if they not comply. It has been a week and I have not received payment of {$2000.00} and all XXXX card remain in collections. This will not only not go away until amount paid in full by XX/XX/XXXX, but my four years of extreme loss due to CAPITAL ONE behavior has also cost me countless hours, and my time is worth something to me I will start adding {$100.00} a day late fees as of XX/XX/XXXX. I have been patient for you to do the right thing long enough, this endless stalling, half baked excuses and backwoods theatrics are all I can take. I am a consumer that life is on mend due to catastrophic incidents in which CAPITAL ONE played a large part in creating more issues on top. I am documenting everything as I try to move forward and below you will see a list of things including MEDIA PRESS RELEASES to inform other CAPITAL ONE users and consumers, SENATOR office and the like, showing a copy of this letter and my proof, as well as hold you personally responsible for this unlawful and unjust behavior. 

FDIC and OCC was in receipt of the same XXXX page letter as you and after their review they submitted CAPITAL ONE also to CONSUMERFINANCE.GOV. 

I have spent a better part of FOUR years trying to resolve these issues, and there are more than XXXX issues. I have also been told that CAPITAL ONE has had more complaints than any other CREDIT CARD company and a lot of them were made right around same time I stopped using the cards in XX/XX/XXXX and you also had over XXXX class action lawsuits similar in nature. Please bare that in mind as you remember that I have tried working with CAPITAL ONE and not only are my issues similar as ones reported, but I have more of the average. 

Let me also remind you, CAPITAL ONE was given IDENTITY THEFT papers. That I also made regular payments on time, and often. And, that I called and personally canceled the cards and then sent in a last payment. Which I did not have to do with FTC {$50.00} liability per card used. 

I am listing the issues below, all of which I have proof and our witnesses for, and CAPITAL ONE has had its time to take care of this the amount of my loss, is inconceivable to what XXXX reported SECURED cards ontio of being beaten repeatedly by gangsters then identity theft and robbed of all possessions. If I do not get CAPITAL ONE immediate cooperation with {$2000.00} payment and XXXX cards out of collections, I will have to take drastic measures. I will be submitting this letter to ever ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE, ever financial website, every government agency, the FDIC and OCC will get a copy on top of their records as well as CONSUMERFINANCE.GOV where I will be reporting in several different areas as well as XXXX XXXX, and this will go to the law firms who recently had a class action lawsuit with CAPITAL ONE as well as any other law firm handles these matters. I wanted to work with you guys but it 's been several years and I know you are just doing your job, but as you see below, EVERYTHING, I REPEAT, everything below is exactly what happened, and CAPITAL ONE has not even admitted to one of these issues, rather try to find as many issues you think you can with me, to avoid all the irregular activity CAPTIAL ONE was doing. 

I am not looking for a rebuttal, just the {$2000.00} settlement and XXXX cards out of collections, unless I find out that XXXX XXXX did make a payment to you guys in which I know in next day or so and that be added to {$2000.00}. All these issues I have sent to CAPITAL ONE in past and have been verified as solid consumer issues in which CAPITAL ONE IS RESPONSIBLE, if CAPITAL ONE is gon na go through this list in hopes to find one that seems like it 's a grey area for you to use to try to wiggle out of this, the issues I first present are the only ones that should have mattered and CAPTIAL ONE"

Capital One,"We were told we were XXXX days late on a payment to this card ( Capital One ). We thought we payed it off in XXXX 2016 with a payment of over {$3000.00}. We have never been late before. Evidently there were re-occuring charges that we did not know about. XXXX XXXX about {$25.00} per month. We have cancelled that. We talked to a Capital One agent in XXXX about this bill we were getting. He told us that everything would be OK, he would take care of it. Obviously he did n't and now we owed this late amount. My wife in disgust paid the {$190.00} on XXXX XXXX, 2016 just to clear our name. But they say that there is nothing they can do to restore her credit rating of over XXXX since it is over XXXX days late. We are trying to refinance. 
Obviously these big companies could care less about us little guys. They just do n't believe us. Also, we never received any paper statement about this bill. Our refinance guy found out about this.

Capital One,Complant on XXXX bank Captial One bank at some time credit card was not in my on me I sent letters to banks to let them know I do not have credit cards on me never did they ask for payment late charges and keep on miss information with credit information.
Capital One,"I received a Capital One Platinum Mastercard in the mail with all the usual verbiage about privacy terms of use, etc. on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I have never requested a card from Capital One and do not want this one. A day later, on XXXX XXXX, I received a badly printed letter advising me that a fraudulent account was opened in my name and that I needed to call and verify if it was me because I might be a victim of identity theft. This letter contained the last XXXX digits of the card number and my name, which was misspelled. Upon receiving the letter, I did a search on the phone number listed and discovered that it was a common scam. I have not activated the card but I am concerned someone is trying to use my personal information to open accounts in my name."
Capital One,"I have contacted XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX many times to dispute this Capital One account that had been fraudulently compromised many years ago. I have not had any success in getting this fraudulent account removed from my credit file. I have reported that this account was stolen a few years ago. I need your help in getting this account remove from my credit file. Not to mention, my identity was stolen along with the accounts being compromised."

Capital One,"My wife applied online for a credit card from Capital One and was approved. She has XXXX other Capital One Card and I have XXXX, that we have used for several years. The personal information provided for this new card is the same as the information on file for those other cards. When we received the new cards in the mail I went online to activate them but was told the cards had been restricted and I needed to call XXXX. I called the number and was transferred to the Fraud department. The agent I spoke to said there was suspected fraudulent activity and my wife needed to provide some information. My wife got on the phone and answered all of the questions asked, confirming that there was no fraudulent activity associated with this new card. The Capital One agent then told my wife that to lift the restriction she would need to send them her Drivers license, Social Security Card, and Birth Certificate. My wife refused and handed the phone back to me. The agent repeated the demand to me, at which point I told her that was never going to happen, this was way more trouble than it was worth, and to just shut the card down. The agent then told me "" the card will remain open and restricted, and we will negatively impact your wife 's credit score until you provide those documents ''. At that point I ended the call. The three documents Capital One 's fraud department is asking us to provide are the three best documents someone would love to get a hold of to steal an identity. Their fraud department is asking us to put our identity at risk. Threatening my wife 's credit score if we do n't provide the requested documents is extortion."

I charged my Capital One credit card with an amount of {$7300.00} and that was in XXXX 2015. After the three day seminar I waited for a week to receive a call from XXXX XXXX and none was received. I signed up into the client account and inquired when the training would begin. Training started with a lady called XXXX, I questioned the training as it was a group training done via the phone and my employees including I started to question what training we were receiving as all was coming in the training had nothing to do with what was promised during the seminar. I wrote back with a complaint and told the training couch XXXX that I was going to end the training immediate and file a dispute with my credit card company as the product provided was not what I attended the business seminar for. I have several e-mail correspendence with XXXX XXXX client service couch XXXX and their customer service for complaints to the last day I pulled out of their program. I wrote to Capital One, including XXXX other banks, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX Bank where I had also charged these credit cards with XXXX XXXX program training package. I received my money back with the other banks and waited on Capital One for. All documentation was sent to Capital One within a timely manner. I waiting for their response and after waiting for so long, I called their office to see the status of my claim. Was told it was still in process, I asked why a temporary credit was not put back on my card as other credit cards companies credited my card as a temporary credit while claim was in process. Capital One did not credit me with anything, all was told was that claim was still in the process, I asked if there was any documentation to receive and sign and they advised, documentation was on the way. Seems documentation was only mailed after my call to remind them. I received a form that needed me to explain why I was filing a dispute, I completed all the information and mailed it back to Capital One with a long covering letter. I waiting for their response, none came for weeks and no temporary credit was put back on my card. I then called again as a follow up and to my surprise, I was transferred to another department and was told that the claim was closed. I asked why the claim was closed and was told because no documents were received and they had tried to call me but my phone was disconnected. I could not believe it, I told them they there is no way my phone could be disconnected, Capital One had my house phone as XXXX XXXX XXXX and my cell phone which is XXXX XXXX. I asked "" Tell me which number you called ''?. They repeated my cell phone with a wrong last digit. My cell is XXXX XXXX and the person gave me a number with the last XXXX digit XXXX. The person 's name was XXXX, I told him that is not my cell phone and reason it says phone was disconnected. We argued a lot and all I was told was that the claim was closed and I have to continue making payments on my credit card. I told that XXXX that I was not going to make any payments on my credit card as they misplaced my claim documents. I tried to look for an attorney but can not afford XXXX since I run a XXXX that has no funding. Am struggling. I was referred to your organization by someone called XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX and I thank him. I await your response, and enclosed is a letter to Capital One after talking to their XXXX on the phone. I have other supporting documents if needed. Capital One account ending XXXX."
Capital One,"I am bankruptcy, am still going through bankruptcy. I have never had credit with capital one credit. the bill statement read XXXX balance,XXXX transaction,XXXX due XX/XX/XXXX.i did not ask for credit, i donnot want credit.i filed bankruptcy XXXX. I am still in the process"
Capital One,"Capital One has me down for 30-59 days late when I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX! The 30 day late is affecting my credit score tremendously and it is simply wrong! XX/XX/XXXX payments are {$25.00} a month and they waived a {$35.00} late fee that was added to the payment! Since it was waived I still paid the {$60.00} which would have been XXXX payments plus an additional {$10.00}! I know a payment is due each month but to mark me late when I actually paid over the XXXX due is simply bad business! They still as of today have me down as XXXX days past due! Please see my credit report and actual capital one payment information below! I did contact them and they said they are reporting this correctly. I disagree!

Capital One,"[ XXXX XXXX ] [ XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX ] Account Number : [ XXXX ] [ XXXX/XXXX/2016 ] To Whom It May Concern : Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and I hope your day is going well. I 'm writing because I noticed that my most recent credit report contains late payments on my Capital One account. 
I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it were n't for my job cutting my pay then I would have been able to make full payments instead of partial payments. I 'd have an excellent repayment record. I made a mistake in falling behind, but since then, I have received a pay raise and will be able to pay on time every month."
Capital One,"In a nut shell, I have made XXXX purchases with same merchant and had returned the product from XXXX transaction. When I got the bill, I did not recognize XXXX transaction ( {$67.00} ) and put a disputed it, Few days later I remember as a legitimate charge. I called the bank and told them to release the money. 
Since I had made a return with the same merchant, the merchant had issued a credit for that transaction. The actual disputed transaction has no relation to this credit. 
Since I disputed the transaction through the credit card, the credit card issued a credit, but when investigated, the credit card company ran into a credit that has nothing to do with the disputed transaction. This transaction has different times and reference number etc, the merchant took the position that since the merchant has issued a credit, even though a different amount, product, time, reference etc, the credit card company rebill be the credit as a charge on my account for {$67.00}. 
The credit card has not released the money to the merchant nor to the consumer but put it in their pocket where it does not belong. 
The money must be returned to merchant and given proof to consumer to follow up with merchant or return to the consumer. thanks I have called a few times but all invain."
Capital One,"I have XXXX late payment with this account. My brother passed away and I was emotionally not stable. I called the credit card company to ask them to remove the late payment, but they would n't. I have never been late except for this one time."
Capital One,"Capital One is refusing to provide me with my old/last account number. I have spent hours of the phone getting transferred to different departments within Capital One and they said they are not allow to provide that information to me. I need this full number to access XXXX XXXX 's system in order to find an old receipt for a purchase I made using this card. Since it was a secondary card ( it was under my name and social security number, but used by my husband with his name on it XXXX, it is not listed on the old account statements. Only my primary credit card number is listed on the statements."
Capital One,Capital One refuses to issue credit balance refund of over {$1800.00}. They stole my money fir nearly one year. They keep making excuses for stealing my money. Ive provided them with identity proof with my id and social security card but they still wont send. My utility bill is in my roommates name so I cant give cap one that.
Capital One,"I contacted Capital One customer service to find out why my balance never goes down when I make every payment on time and hardly ever use the card. The man that I was speaking with was fairly pleasant through the conversation. I was not understanding what he was telling me. He said he would transfer me to someone else. As he was transferring me to another person he began cursing in English and XXXX ( XXXX ), and said something about XXXX my mother. I was so shocked I did not say a word. Once I was transferred I asked if the previous conversation was recorded and explained what happened. He said it was recorded and that they would look into it. The second representative credited me my interest for the last month for my inconvenience. I do n't feel that this is enough compensation. I did nothing to deserve being spoke to in that manner."
Capital One,"I had an overdue account for several months. However, in XXXX 2016, I paid my account in full. ( XXXX balance ) I talked to a customer service representative to get the payoff amount and I was given and paid that amount and told my account was current. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I was told that current meant XXXX balance, but not necessarily active. Several weeks later, I attempted to use my card for the first time in 2016 and it did not work. Upon checking, there unpaid interest charges that were added after I was told the payoff amount. The agent refunded the charges but told me that my account was restricted and I would have to wait three weeks to be contacted about unrestricted offer. I was contacted today and told that my unrestricted offer was denied because their agent told me my account was current but never told me the account was active. However, they did not tell me it was restricted. As a result, I have an open account, zero balance, but an unusable line of credit. When I asked about getting it unrestricted, I was asked two personal questions 1 ) why did you account go unpaid for a few months 2 ) what do you need your card for. 

After I responded -1 ) financial difficulties 2 ) necessary purchase which I can not make with my bank debit card I was told that I did not meet the criteria. I asked why and the agent said - we can not disclose our criteria. Another option is to wait to maybe, not guaranteed, receive a mail offer to unrestrict where there is no criteria. 

I asked repeatedly for an explanation why? no answer. I feel I should get a reason."
Capital One,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : Account number : XXXX 120 days past due as of XXXX 2010 90 days past due as of XXXX 2010 60 days past due as of XXXX 2010 30 days past due as of XXXX 2010 I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Capital One,My capital one credit card is charging me outrages charges for interest and cash withdrawals and will not let me complain about a fraudulent charge.
Capital One,"Capital One unethically procured my credentials from credit bureaus and kept performing "" prescreening '' or credit check on my account WITHOUT my consent. I kept getting promotional offers almost twice a month for about 8-10 months. The communication was never clear about the clandestine prescreening checks being made frequently. This could severely affect my credit history and limit my access to financial resources in my hour of need. I wish that CFPB takes stern action against Capital One and I demand an apology from the credit card company. Thank you!"
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I accepted an offer online from Capital One to get a balance transfer for zero points and my regular rate of interest. I requested Capital One, account ending in XXXX, send {$6300.00} to our XXXX Cash Rewards Card ending in XXXX. I received an email stating that it was sent the next day, XXXX XXXX. Today, I called CapitalOne to see why the amount had not yet been credited to our XXXX credit card account and was told that Capital One does not accept electronic transfers of this nature, but only accepts a paper check, so the initial attempt by Capital One was not successful. At that time, a paper transaction was made. The banks both state that it sometimes takes up to 10-12 days to complete the transaction. During this time, the customer incurs 16.1 % on the balance transferred. In addition, the customer is paying interest to XXXX Bank for the amount on the card, or 17.1 %. So, together, the customer is paying 33.2 % on this amount of {$6300.00}, for maybe 12 days, amounting to {$69.00} which is borne by the lowly customer. I am sure I am not the only person that is in this situation, so I can see how this could be a very profitable situation for the banks. I realize that the customer should pay the originating loan interest up to the time the amount is transacted into the receiving bank. But, this situation is obviously one where banks are taking advantage of customers. Please investigate this practice to determine why this practice is allowed to exist in which the customer/consumer is obviously being "" robbed '' by the banks and credit card companies."
Capital One,I was ask by a store employee to open a kohls department credit card and they have really been difficult to deal with they harrased me when it came to pay my payments and i was not allowed to return the items that i purchased back on my credit card and they also gave me instore credit instead of putting the return items on the card and when i return something they gave me less and i was upset about this some of the items are really cool. They also had issues with pricing the items. alot of my payments i made on due date and they would say it was not on time and then they try to put me in some hardship program which really did not help the consumer at all and you were receiving late fees and other issues.
Capital One,"a credit card with Capital One, had an auto renewal fee, with no statement mailed to me, and added a late fee, over time, I had a reporting on my credit report that had negatively effected my credit rating. I have not used this card in years, if I ever used it. I do not recall getting their card in 2011. I am attaching a page from my credit report. Capital One has reversed the charge on my account, but my credit report is still showing a lower score due to this mistake on the report. Can you have it fully reversed?"
Capital One,"My wife has a Capital One Platinum card. {$5000.00} credit. She quit using the card in XXXX, after she retired. The last time she used was for a dental appointment which almost maxed it out. Since late XXXX we have been paying on it monthly with out fail between {$120.00} to as much as {$200.00}. All of this time the principal was creeping up by a few cents. As of XXXX XXXX XXXX we have paid {$12000.00} on the bill and the balance had come up to less then {$500.00}. I finally realized that that did not look right and contacted Capital One and was given the story about interest verses balance. But when I pointed out that we were not using the card they said it made no difference and ended it there, but the balance did jump from under {$500.00} to {$890.00}, still far less then the almost {$13000.00} we paid out."
Capital One,"I used my CapitalOne Visa credit card in XXXX to contribute to an "" XXXX '' campaign in exchange for a "" perk ''. The perk was a drone that arrived in XXXX. Unfortunately, the drone did n't work, it was dead on arrival. I tried to work with the drone manufacturer, XXXX, via phone and email. XXXX agreed that the product was dead on arrival, but XXXX refused to provide any repair, exchange, or refund. 

I asked Visa to dispute the transaction and Visa provided a tentative refund on XXXX XXXX. Visa reversed the refund on XXXX XXXX and asked for additional documentation to support my claim. Visa received XXXX pages of emails and testimonials from me on XXXX XXXX. Visa sent the following letter to me on XXXX XXXX XXXX : "" Hello XXXX XXXX XXXX We have received your documentation and will continue your transaction dispute investigation. We may contact you with follow-up questions, but until then, no additional information is needed. '' I called Visa on XXXX XXXX to check the status of my claim. I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and he assured me that the documentation was in order, that I needed to allow at least 10 business days, and he added a note to my case stating that I was available by phone and email in case anyone had any questions or needed any additional information. 

I called Visa on XXXX XXXX to check status and was told that my claim was denied. I was transferred countless times ( agents XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc, etc, etc ) and put on hold for hours as I tried to learn what had gone wrong. Every agent I spoke with agreed that XXXX admitted in writing that the drone was dead on arrival, but that is not sufficient proof that there is a problem with the "" perk ''. 

Visa did n't follow their own procedures and Visa denies they sent me the above letter ( it 's on CapitalOne letterhead, copy available upon request ). XXXX agent actually told me that there 's no place for common sense in this process. 

Visa makes it easy for bad merchants to take advantage of well intentioned consumers. Visa creates a moral hazard for all of us when they intentionally delay, and ultimately deny, refunds for defective merchandise."
Capital One,The interest was raised from XXXX to XXXX and we try to deal with the interest raise and they refused.
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015 someone fraudulently opened a credit card account with Capital One in my name. The good news is that Capital One realized it was fraudulent and called me to confirm that I had not submitted the application before they sent out the cards, and they immediately closed the account. The bad news is they still have not removed the credit inquiries from my credit reports. The hard pull shows on both my XXXX and XXXX credit reports, and negatively impacts my credit score. Every time I call Capital One ( 4 times so far ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) they tell me "" it 's in the process of being removed. '' It 's ridiculous that it has taking over 9 months to remove the inquiries from my credit report."
Capital One,The interest on my card is reflected as part of the minimum payment and again applied as a purchase against my available credit. It appears to me to be double dipping. the interest depletes my payment. Reducing the amount applied against balance. Then again applied against the available purchasing power.
Capital One,"Capital one promised to call and never did they no they are committing a mega crime, I was XXXX asap or i am filing criminal charges. It has been a week and I have not received payment of {$2000.00} and all XXXX card remain in collections. This will not only not go away until amount paid in full by XXXX XXXX, XXXX, but my four years of extreme loss due to CAPITAL ONE behavior has also cost me countless hours, and my time is worth something to me I will start adding {$100.00} a day late fees as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I have been patient for you to do the right thing long enough, this endless stalling, half baked excuses and backwoods theatrics are all I can take. I am a consumer that life is on mend due to XXXX incidents in which CAPITAL ONE played a large part in creating more issues on top. I am documenting everything as I try to move forward and below you will see a list of things including MEDIA PRESS RELEASES to inform other CAPITAL ONE users and consumers, SENATOR office and the like, showing a copy of this letter and my proof, as well as hold you personally responsible for this unlawful and unjust behavior. 

FDIC and OCC was in receipt of the same XXXX page letter as you and after their review they submitted CAPITAL ONE also to CONSUMERFINANCE.GOV. 

I have spent a better part of FOUR years trying to resolve these issues, and there are more than XXXX issues. I have also been told that CAPITAL ONE has had more complaints than any other CREDIT CARD company and a lot of them were made right around same time I stopped using the cards in XXXX and you also had over XXXX class action lawsuits similar in nature. Please bare that in mind as you remember that I have tried working with CAPITAL ONE and not only are my issues similar as ones reported, but I have more of the average. 

Let me also remind you, CAPITAL ONE was given IDENTITY THEFT papers. That I also made regular payments on time, and often. And, that I called and personally canceled the cards and then sent in a last payment. Which I did not have to do with FTC {$50.00} liability per card used. 

I am listing the issues below, all of which I have proof and our witnesses for, and CAPITAL ONE has had its time to take care of this the amount of my loss, is inconceivable to what XXXX reported SECURED cards ontio of being beaten repeatedly by gangsters then identity theft and robbed of all possessions. If I do not get CAPITAL ONE immediate cooperation with {$2000.00} payment and XXXX cards out of collections, I will have to take drastic measures. I will be submitting this letter to ever ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE, ever financial website, every government agency, the FDIC and OCC will get a copy on top of their records as well as CONSUMERFINANCE.GOV where I will be reporting in several different areas as well as XXXX XXXX, and this will go to the law firms who recently had a class action lawsuit with CAPITAL ONE as well as any other law firm handles these matters. I wanted to work with you guys but it 's been several years and I know you are just doing your job, but as you see below, EVERYTHING, I REPEAT, everything below is exactly what happened, and CAPITAL ONE has not even admitted to one of these issues, rather try to find as many issues you think you can with me, to avoid all the irregular activity CAPTIAL ONE was doing. 

I am not looking for a rebuttal, just the {$2000.00} settlement and XXXX cards out of collections, unless I find out that XXXX XXXX did make a payment to you guys in which I know in next day or so and that be added to {$2000.00}. All these issues I have sent to CAPITAL ONE in past and have been verified as solid consumer issues in which CAPITAL ONE IS RESPONSIBLE, if CAPITAL ONE is gon na go through this list in hopes to find one that seems like it 's a grey area for you to use to try to wiggle out of this,"
Capital One,"Hi my name is XXXX XXXX, I had filed a previous complaint against capital one credit cards, however I have given them enough time to adjust the fradulent charges on my credit cards, however they did make a few adjustments on XXXX of the credit cards, but failed to do so on the other card, I contacted Capital One Fraud team and asked tgem to mail me out copies of all charges from credit card statements, however they did so on XXXX of the credit cards, and I found numerous of fradulent charges on that card alone, that I was unaware of, I called the fraud team at capital one to report these fradulent charges, and they never responded back to me, nor gave me a credit for all of the fradulent charges that I reported. Might I add I called Capital One Fraud team numerous of times, and they really do n't care, I also explained that I am a XXXX person, XXXX to make any out of state purchases, but they still are refusing to issue me credit, I am tired of paying them for charges that I did n't make, also on the credit that they issued on the XXXX card, they recalled some of it back, and they would never mail me a full statement on the card ending in XXXX, I would be happy to mail you all the fradulent charges that they are making me pay for.I will contact a lawyer if it 's not resolved in a timely manner.I have already given capital one months to investigate this matter, but still no response, I called oneday and asked for a supervisor on account ending in XXXX, and he refused to help me, and informed me that was n't his problem. But they are advertising XXXX fraud on fradulent charges, not true, capital one has treated me like a criminal, and has no respect for their customers, these fradulent charges has been going on since capital one issued these XXXX cards through regular mail, since I have filed a previous complaint with CFPB, capital one changed my credit cards, and now both cards has a security chip, and I have not had any fradulent charges since. But once again I have given capital one enough time to correct these fradulent charges"
Capital One,"In XXXX, 2016, I received a voicemail from Capital One Fraud Department asking me to call right away since they believed they had detected "" suspicious activity on XXXX of my credit card accounts. '' Over four months later, I continue to be billed for fees and interest on a closed account that Capital One agreed had been used fraudulently via identity theft, and that we had XXXX liability to pay. Capital One assured me that I ( and my husband, whose name was also on the account ) would not have our credit scores affected, and yet Capital One continues to report that we are "" past due '' for money we do n't owe ( that they agreed was stolen via identify theft in the first place ) ; they refuse to help correct our credit score. Capital One keeps "" finding '' additional charges on our account when I call them to inquire why they keep billing us for a closed account with a {$0.00} balance ; they refuse to send us anything in writing, so we have never seen the charges we are meant to dispute ; we also sent Capital One a registered letter under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and by law they were required to reply in writing within 30 days ( they did n't ) and to cease attempting to collect money ( they have n't ). What began as a "" simple '' theft of {$15.00} has turned into a 4+ month nightmare of repeated calls, repeated billings for money we do n't owe, XXXX perfect credit scores lowered without any of this being our fault, no apologies, and no end in sight."
Capital One,"I am re submit my complaint with Capital one Bank I have not had a Capital one Bank card. I had request copy of validation debit and the only thing I have receive statement and payment made at gram money for this o account. Until now I have never receive any paperwork or statement from this Company, My personal information has been used without my permission. I had send over multiple police and letter and fill out affidavit. I also send copy from my back account showing when I dispute an unauthorized transaction from this company. I I am sending all my paperwork also to CFPB"
Capital One,"On XXXX 2016, I spoke with Capital One in regards to my issue. I explained to them that I had issues submitting my payment online, which I thought that the payment went through. I went through my bank statement and notice that it did n't go through. I went on and explained to them that I did n't want it to harm my credit because I am submitting my payment at a later date. I also went into conversing with them, letting them know that I been requested to change my due date on this credit card. I have XXXX credit cards with Capital One. They assured me that this would happen, they would change the date. They assure me that they were not going to report to the credit bureau. They accepted my payment and gave me my confirmation. Now, I am just noticing that they did report my payment as late to the credit bureau. I explained to them over the phone the other day about my credit. They told me that it should n't have been reported and that I would need to get in contact with the credit bureau. I 've gotten in contact with the credit bureau and they told me the only thing I can do is dispute this late payment. I received the dispute and looked at it and saw that Capital One did n't change anything, they kept it the same. The representative assured me that my payments reflected that I made my payments on time but on my credit bureau its showing different. This have drop my credit score tremendously. I am so upset with Capital One and I thought they were suppose to help with your credit. I ca n't believe that the representative are trained to give the wrong information. I wish someone could please fix this issue because I am really upset at this time."
Capital One,"I am disputing a 30 day late on my XXXX credit report. I have a issue with XXXX late payment in XXXX which was a little bit after I moved from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ga XXXX to XXXX GA XXXX and also thought this was setup on automatic payments do to previous manual payments and asking to be setup on auto billing. I was unaware of any notices sent to my previous address saying that my payment was going to be late or any need of a payment due. Please remove this late payment off all credit bureaus. 

I really appreciate your assistance"
Capital One,"Capital One-I had an account with them years ago. I paid it off and asked them to close the account. They instead sent me a new one with an annual fee charge. I asked them remove that and close the account. They said they did-I had already cut up the card. Much later, I received a bill and it had XXXX charges on it. I did n't make those charges. I have sent them a registered letter and spoke to a few people. I get calls daily-I do n't answer them. I tried calling the fraud department and all they do is send me to collections."
Capital One,"My credit card was opened in XXXX. At some point in XXXX, electronic delivery of my statements was activated without my permission and I failed to receive notification that my account was overdue. They never attempted to contact me via United States Postal Service. I became aware of the unpaid balance when I got a copy of my credit report showing the 30-day delinquency in XXXX XXXX."
Capital One,"Hello, My Capital One credit card account has charged off on my credit report. I did a balance transfer in XXXX XXXX from Capital One to another credit card in order to consolidate. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received my FIRST phone call from a collection agency that works with Capital One. Apparently I have a {$5100.00} balance on my Capital One card and Capital One has not received a payment in over 6mths. This is the FIRST communication I have received from Capital One in regards to this matter. They stated the balance transfer never went through and the account has now charged off. I scheduled payment with the collection agency immediately to pay the full amount that is in sitting in collections. My payment history with this company has been stellar until XXXX XXXX, when I assumed the balance transfer took place. If I would have been informed 30-60 days after missing a payment I would have ensured to take care of the matter. How is it possible that a company NEVER reaches out to the consumer in cases like this? 
Desired Resolution : Correction to a credit report Desired Outcome I would like this charge off removed from all XXXX credit bureaus due to the fact I was never properly notified. My payment history with Capital One has always been perfect until this matter. I feel that Capital One has a duty to contact consumers within 30-60 days of a payment being late in order to avoid situations such as this."
Capital One,I applied for Kohls credit card and they denied stating that they were unable to verify my SSN. but I see a hard inquiry on my credit report.
Capital One,WAS TOLD BY CAPITAL ONE THAT IN 2002 THERE WAS A CHARGE OFF IN THE AMOUNT OF {$2100.00} IN MY NAME OWE TO THEM. HOWEVER I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED OF ANY SUCH CHARGE OFFS OR EVEN SEEN THIS ON MY CREDIT REPORTS. I ALSO WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THIS WHEN I HAVE SINCE OPEN XXXX ACCOUNTS WITH CAPITAL ONE IN MY NAME SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND DOB.
Capital One,"When I ran my credit report to buy a home I found a credit card from Capital One on my report ..I do n't have nor have I ever had a capital one account..I called Capital One and got the run around being passed from person to person who kept asking for the card number..I do n't have an account how can I have the number..Told them I was calling the fraud department for a fraudulent account they put me in touch with a person named XXXX who said she would call me back in 24 to 48 hours.. never did, than I find out that they closed the investigation and were holding me financially responsible for this account..How can I be held responsible for an account I never opened someone else did and they wo n't return my calls to resolve this matter..It 's XXXX dollars and is wrecking my credit they do n't care..I need help to get this off my credit"
Capital One,Capital one closed/locked me out of using my credit card to update the card to a chip. Thus for over 1 month I was unable to have access to my revolving credit as they were unable to send the card during that time.
Capital One,"XX/XX/XXXX Business was very slow at the company I worked for. Bills started to pile up and I worked out a agreement to pay {$800.00} within a specified timeline by Capital One. I paid the {$800.00}. Not once did Capital One say to me that it would be reported to the Credit Bureau ( s ) as bad credit. They are still reporting it every month even though we agreed on a amount back XX/XX/XXXX. Most of it was late charges. I find this misleading. I have great credit, I have a car loan and the payment is made every month on time. Had I known this "" settlement '' would damage my credit, I would have NEVER agreed to settle. Now I 'm being told that nothing can be done about it. This is not right, it needs to be addressed so people know when a Credit Card company is indicating that they are helping you solve your debt issue when in a financial crisis arises by paying them a amount you both agree upon, they also need to communicate the later part, oh by the way you will still get reported to the Credit Bureau, after you scraped by to get the situation resolved."
Capital One,"My ex husband XXXX XXXX has horrible credit, when I left him in XXXX he used my information to open up a business credit card using my information and his business. XXXX XXXX he got incarcerated and I started getting calls from debt collectors at capital one for this credit card. The limit I believe is {$3000.00}. Now this is on my credit as a collection. I reported the card as fraud with Capital One. The response was that since my social security number was correct in the application, then it is not a fraudulent account."
Capital One,"Hello, I applied a payment of {$5000.00} dollars to my Capitail One XXXX card and thet did not apply it to the highest apr.. I called them and they told me they did not have to.

Capital One,"Dear sir or XXXX, I 'm weighting this in regards to my capital one credit card I 'm XXXX or 2016 I become ill under the care of a Dictor and XXXX by the Doctior I was having some serious health issues that I 'm only know barely recovering from.

i did notify my credit card company of my desabilty and how it was keeping me from working..they stated no problems XXXX XXXX we have a program to protect you while your XXXX is n't well, i said "" great thank you "". So much Starting in late XXXX when I contacted them. The following month.i did n't receive a bill in the mail, as well as XXXX and XXXX. I had figured it was all under the program the customer service rep had enrolled me in I thought at the time he had said everything will be on hold tell you are better and at that time call us you can make a Payment. Was was very relieved to her this.i called on XXXX first and made a payment just as I had promised. When I made the payment. I was Informed that thag was n't the case and I had been charged for all the months with late fees. Explaining my situation heavily medicated at the time.and what my account was on hold per the gentleman I faked to, stared no it just does n't build intrest and lower your Paynent. I was cocked!! the lady explained I spoke to a manager they returned all the late fee. Again I was thrilled. I descovered there is a 60 day late on my credit report and maybe a 90 I told them all this they reven so they seen there fault and miscommunication of felt do to me being sick and desabled in and out of the hospital that they would remove the late payments but not the credit reporting ones. This is unfair I did what I was told they say they mailed bills now but I never recieved any. Stating you knew you had a bill in your mind.i I had to laugh honestly"

Capital One,"I applied for a card with Capital One in XXXX 2016, and was approved for the Platinum ( with a {$300.00} limit ), a card other than the XXXX I thought I was applying for ( the XXXX ). I was informed by email that I had been enrolled in the Credit Builder program ( an email I am no longer able to find ), the description of which states that the card does not report to the credit bureaus for the first five months, and I decided to make the best of things and keep the card, since it would have no impact for those months. The first statement did not report, but the second statement did, and due to heavy usage of the card that month, my credit scores dropped like a rock. It was at this point that I first contacted the company, on XXXX XXXX, and it took the wonderful customer service representative over an hour, and multiple times of putting me on hold, to discover that I had been moved into the Credit Steps program instead ( and, according to the representatives I spoke to today, I was placed in Credit Steps immediately and was never in Credit Builder ). The representative and I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to close the card, and dispute the existence of the account with the credit reporting bureaus, as a fraudulent account, due to the glitches encountered with respect to the account/program not being as expected or advertised. I was told it could take up to 60 days for the bureaus to update the information, and when they had not done so, I called Capital One back on XXXX XXXX and was then told it could be XXXX days. On XXXX XXXX, after 90 days had passed, and it was still on my reports, I called up XXXX and XXXX directly, and they were able to remove it with no hassle. XXXX refused to remove it, saying that Capital One was still reporting it to them, and that it would be back next month even if they removed it, but that they would send them an electronic letter requesting authorization to remove it. I received an email from XXXX and a letter in the mail from Capital One telling me that it was not removed, and that the account information was accurate. Since then, I have checked my credit reports, and despite XXXX and XXXX having agreed to remove the account, and removing it, it is back on both of those reports ; Capital One filed the disputes on my behalf, but continues to send the credit reporting bureaus information that contradicts those very disputes. 

I spoke with a Capital One online chat customer service representative this morning ( XXXX XXXX ), as I had finally given up on ever getting the account removed from my reports, and decided the best thing to do was to have it be product changed into the product that I expected that I was applying for in the first place. After going through the entire story with the representative, she told me that she could not reopen the account, because I had requested it closed, and that unfortunately she could not help me. I was told that all I could do was apply for a new card, and with Capital One querying all three credit bureaus, and refusing to remove my old account, I am certainly not going to do that ; they 've caused me enough damage. I was denied by XXXX for a card in XXXX for having XXXX too many recently opened cards ; they explicitly told me that if I had not had the Capital One card appearing on my report, that they would have approved me. 

Finally, before contacting the CFPB, I called Capital One 's executive customer service number just now, and was told that they can not do anything either. Furthermore, I was told that I could not have received an email telling me that I was enrolled in Builder, as Builder is something that customers are invited to apply for, not something that happens automatically upon card approval."
Capital One,Capital One took money from my checking account and will not put it back. I have called several times. The transactions were not authorized and I have communicated that with them.
Capital One,"Capital One keeps denying me for a Credit Line Increase for a credit card i have had with them for several years. The reason behind it according to them is "" We were unable to obtain your most recent monthly payment data from credit reporting agency '' I decided to check with the XXXX credit reporting agencies and all XXXX are reporting with no issues. I have never missed a payment with Capital One and my balance is less than {$500.00} on a {$2000.00} limit. I keep getting offers to open a new card with them on the mail but somehow they insist they can not get access to my payment data when I applied for a credit limit increase. I search online and it appears this is a game Capital One is playing with several customers to basically force them to open new credit accounts."
Capital One,I am being charged an APR of 29.65 % The advertised rate on the Capital One website shows 23.24 %. I have contacted Capital One several times and no resolution or adjustments have been made. This is total false advertising and I am entitled to a refund of the discrepancy amount from the first day that I noticed this huge error.
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I obtained a copy of my XXXX Credit Report which showed Capital One had ran XXXX requests for credit history information. These inquiries started on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This was excessive so on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX an employee of Capital One, was contacted. He stated credit inquiries are ran as new applications for credit is received. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX an employee of Capital One was contacted, she stated that once approval has been given additional credit inquiries are not needed, However, your payment history will be reported to the credit bureaus. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX an employee of Capital One was contacted. XXXX stated additional credit inquiries will be made if additional applications for credit is received. I have not submitted any additional applications for credit in over three years. My account is current. If Capital One policy is to run credit inquiries when additional applications have been received, then constant inquiries into my credit history is not warranted."
Capital One,"I have an account with Capital One and have never been late or missed a payment. For a while I had been making the minimum payment due and I applied for a credit line increase last year and was turned down because I was only making the minimum payment due even though I had never been late or missed a payment. XX/XX/XXXX I stopped using the account so I would not be at the maximum limited and increased my payment from XXXX XXXX to XXXX. On or around XX/XX/XXXX I applied again for an increase and was denied again, this time because my average payment has been to low. I feel like they are not treating me fairly because I am a XXXX veteran and a XXXX. I have in good faith done everything that is legally required of me and I am seeking your assistance."
Capital One,"Neiman Marcus Dispute Customer since XXXX, no missed payments. 
On XXXX I checked my Neiman Marcus / Capital One account to see if the Credit was issued on my account for a return "" Claim Complete Credit '' for package not received only to find my account was CLOSED due to "" High Returns ''. 

This claim has been going on for a month and still no credit. As of today XXXX I have yet to receive a refund.

Capital One,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : Account number : XXXX 30 days past due XXXX I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Capital One,Someone stole wallet and was charged back amounts by Capital One
Capital One,I had unemployment insurance on my Capital One account and they marked my account late 6 times on my credit report.
Capital One,"Capital One improperly reported my payment as 31-60 days late. I made my payment on the 30th day and I paid one month ahead, in addition. The improper report decimated my credit score causing irreversible damages. I requested removal and Capital One instructed me to file a complaint here. The agent refused to examine the calendar, date of actual payment and the latitude for payments that 's fall on weekends. This report reflects a predatory and dangerous lending practice that has virtually ruined my life and plans for the next 7 years. The lender and I disagree over one day."
Capital One,"I had a Capital One credit card since 2010, and I never got any credit line increase. At the same time my credit line with other XXXX companies increased from {$800.00} to {$6000.00}. I requested credit line increase few times and they rejected it every time with really stupid explanation. Last time they said it is because I was making too small payments. My monthly minimum payment is {$25.00} and I was paying {$60.00}. I never missed any payment, and my credit score is really good. I feel discriminated because no matter what I do they do not want to increase my credit line. Last year my account was paid off and they still did not do it, so it is not because I have a balance on it right now."

I read the email you sent to my account online. I also called your customer service today. No one had a clue what was going on. I would like to know if my permeant credit is what it states.

Capital One,"I was an authorized user on my mother 's Kohl 's card. I was told by my loan officer that I needed to be taken off in order to get a home loan. On XXXX my mother, the cardholder, called customer service. She spoke to XXXX, and he told her I would be taken off and a letter would be mailed. We never received a letter. So on XXXX we called customer service again and talked to XXXX in XXXX. She reported that I was still on the card as an authorized user and that she would take me off that day. She reported that Kohl 's has a "" no emailing '' policy. So she could not send me an email confirming this. She said I would get a letter in 30 days confirming this. This is 2016. I highly doubt there is a no emailing policy. All my loan officer needs is one email from Kohl 's saying I have been taken off. The XXXX housing market is hot. I am incurring money damages with each day I am unable to finalize my loan. I am losing my chance to get a home loan because of a kohl 's card that is n't even mine. I believe there may be an unfair business practice underlying their constant refusal to take me off as an authorized user. They have not reported my status to the credit bureau even though I have asked them twice now. This is having a significant impact on my life."

Capital One,"Capitol One put a 30 day mark on my credit in XXXX 2016 but my bank Capitol One rejected my deposit and I was given different reasons as to why they did that. I need all of the credit marks removed, I have asked Capitol One bank to send a letter detailing this information but they claim they ca n't send a letter just the terms and conditions. I need a letter that states they received the amount of {$340.00} but they sent it back, a supervisor advised me that they ca n't do that. It is not my fault that Capitol One Bank rejected my deposit because it was money orders, but their website does not say they do not accept money orders. I do not think I should be punished for what Capitol One bank did to my deposit."
Capital One,This is in response to Complaint XXXX and XXXX. Capital One in their response to my complaint agreed to remove references to the accounts which I proved in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to Judge XXXX XXXX were paid in full. To date they have not lived up to their response letter of XXXX XXXX 2015. Both accounts which I proved to be paid in full still appear in my credit report with all XXXX agencies. Capital One after the suit by the law firm of XXXX and XXXX sold the account to XXXX XXXX of XXXX VA. I have not only paid these account in full but proved my claim to a judge how agreed the accounts were paid and XXXX and XXXX withdrew the suit.
Capital One,"Capital One case # XXXX Agent : "" XXXX '' Rep ID XXXX XXXX During my honeymoon ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) I was traveling outside the country ( XXXX ) and did not have the ability to submit my credit card payment on time ( Due XX/XX/XXXX ). I called once back in the USA to make payment, and to ask about the late fee being waved. I was placed on hold while the rep verified she could waive my late fee. I was told my late fee would be waved. I informed the rep that was great news, but that I would also like to INCREASE my payment from the minimum amount due to {$200.00}. The rep told me she would have to confirm with her supervisor that had I INCREASED the amount due, that she could still waive my late fee. I said OK I will wait for you to ask again, but before she placed me on hold she began to read me the authorization RSNIP to complete my payment of {$200.00}. I told her "" No, I do not authorize you to process my payment until you confirm my late fee will be waved ''. The rep told me SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PROCESS MY PAYMENT BEFORE CONFIRMING THE LATE FEE WILL STILL BE WAVED. This was a clear act of discrimination based on me increasing the amount I wanted to pay. This allowed the rep to take my payment, and then place me on hold only to come back and say "" we can no longer waive your late fee ''. This deceptive practice is being taught to new call center representatives at Capital One. When I spoke with her supervisor, her supervisor and I exchanged a conversation in which I told him I work in compliance at a bank and in no way what I just heard was legal or ethical. He tried to end the call and confirmed with me while I was on the phone that my payment will be processed. He never processed my payment, and not only was I still left with a late fee, my late payment was not processed. 

I had to try and use my card again to find out that no one processed my payment when I spoke on the phone with them for multiple hours trying to get them to take my money ( the entire basis of their organization ). I became incredibly frustrated at the deliberate attempts to affect my credit by not taking my payment ( This is all on a recorded line, they opened a case, referenced above, and agreed with me that their reps did not act accordingly ). 

I would like a case opened as the 2nd call I placed I was told they could not take my payment while the recorded calls were being investigated. It took a THIRD call for someone to tell me I was able to "" catch up '' with the late payment ( that I had already authorized to take back in XX/XX/XXXX, but was not processed on their end ) to avoid a continual late fee. 

Once the case was closed, a representative called me back to confirm their rep did not follow protocol and that the only thing they could do to honor me was waive the late fee and reduce my minimum payments. I said to the guy "" Are you nuts? Why would I let you lower my fee so that I would just pay MORE interest over a longer period of time? '' When my whole basis of the call was to INCREASE my mim. payment. The {$200.00} auto-pay was finally set up, but the late fee STILL IS NOT WAIVED. 

I can be contacted at XXXX for any related follow up necessary regarding these issues. I want to know fines involved for their blatant discrimination. Thank you"
Capital One,"I posted my credit card payment the day it was due, XXXX XXXX. However, I live on the West Coast and was not able to do so until after XXXX, or after XXXX Eastern. As a result I was charged a late fee and interest. When previously trying to pay my bill, their website was often down, preventing me from doing so. I paid my bill on the correct day, and was still charged a fee, despite never having been "" late '' before. I called customer service to find out what happened and this was what they explained to me."
Capital One,I apply for a capital one student card. the card was very reliable and i could purchase thing where every need but the only problem was when it came to payment. I was always told to pay on price and it would cover the account and then you would pay that amount and the next customer service rep. would tell you that is not enough to cover the balances on the account. They would harrassed me on the phone about payment. and sound real hostile and it was always some kind of issues with late fees and over the limit fees. They never offered thing right assistance to bring account down. you speak to so many people and they are always losing docuement of you information or what was discussed on phone.
Capital One,"30 days past.response not received. 
Please removed hard inquires my credit file. 
Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 661 ( a ) ( 5 ), creditors have 30 days to investigate disputes. If they can not verify the information within the 30 day time period, you must delete all of the dispute accounts from my report"
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX I tried to log into my Capital One Credit Card Online Banking, I could n't because the system told me it was blocked. 
When I called the customer service department, one representative told me : My account has been closed because was market as fraud from the XXXX credit bureau, upon a dispute that I 've filled up for a late payment that still was showing up in my credit report since XXXX 2015, after a year ago when I was making all my payments on time. 
They told me I have to call them ( XXXX ) so they can send them ( Capital one ) a letter so they can open my account once again. 
I called XXXX and they told me I have to call Capital One once again because they have nothing to do with that. I have to get in contact with XXXX operators and XXXX managers at Capital One, XXXX operators and XXXX managers at XXXX, plus the uncomfortable waiting time ( Approximated 10 minutes for each person ) And NO ONE, NOBODY could give me a reasonable answer of WHY they 've closed my account? 
From : You have to contact the credit bureau, we ca n't give you an answer, you have to contact them and then we 'll see if we can re-open it, sir I have told you 4 times I CAN NOT GIVE YOU AN ANSWER to the phone hanging up at Capital One twice. 
I had such an awful night, without mention that that night I need it to send some money to my mother in XXXX XXXX and the only way I could do it was with my credit card. In top of everything, without any explanation they shut down my credit score to XXXX, when I was paying my credit card on time since XX/XX/2015 to fix my credit score. 
So, because I could n't have an answer, a letter, a message, or a simple justification from Capital One, nor from XXXX I only can ask to my self something .... Did they closed my account because I was paying on time and they was n't making any money out of me? Did they closed my account because I was paying some collection bills to fix my credit with the same credit card I was as well paying on time, every 15 days? 
I wish someone could give me an answer, because at the end of the day, the results of building and fixing my credit score, turns into a nightmare for me and I totally get the opposite results, because now I do n't have credit and I have to start all over again thanks to Capital One and XXXX."
Capital One,"We field a prior complaint with CPFB regarding wrongful negative reporting by Kohls department store. We filed a complaint with all XXXX bureaus. XXXX repsonded by letter and removed the negative reporting ( attached ). We heard nothing from XXXX. After several phone calls to call centers we learned that XXXX had no record of a complaint. We filed for the third time. We contacted XXXX, after several attempts and supervisors, they stated that Kohls said the information was correct. They advised that we file another complaint. I understand that Kohls was to have reported to all XXXX buraeus, not just XXXX. This confusion is causing my family great stress. After filing Chapter XXXX in 2011 we have been working XXXX to get back on our feet. We have made an offer on a home and we are about to lose it because of this issue."
Capital One,"In XXXX 2016 I had a secured credit card through Capital One that was closed. After application of the security deposit it left a balance of {$35.00}. While the account is being reported to the credit reporting agencies as closed a recent review of my annual credit reports reflects that Capital One is reporting the account in a derogatory status ( "" past due '' ). A review of my statements from Capital One shows that while the account was closed and had a balance due I am still being assessed past due fees and interest. As of my most recent statement I have been charged in total {$55.00} in fess and interest. My new balance is {$91.00}. Additionally, my most recent statement states that my account is suspended.. I spoke the account representatives and a supervisor by the name of XXXX who stated that since the account still has a balance despite being closed the system reflects it as being suspend. However, I am requesting a review of this account status as a closed account should not be considered suspended. Suspension denotes that the account is active. How can a closed account be considered suspended? My most recent statements reflect I have a credit limit of {$200.00} and a cash advance limit of {$100.00} but no available credit for either. How can I have a credit limit of {$200.00} and a cash advance limit of {$100.00} when the account was closed? Additionally, I am requesting a regulatory review of the fess and interest charged for a closed account and reporting of derogatory information for a closed account to the credit bureaus."
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my husband and I called Capital One to close our credit card. We paid the outstanding balance of {$99.00} by debit card and closed the account. Now six months later, we applied for a new mortgage and after 3 days and many hours of calling Capital One found out that the payment in XX/XX/XXXX did not go through because they had mistakenly tried to take it out of an old XXXX XXXX XXXX account that they had on file which was closed in XXXX. It was our XXXX XXXX account, where all of the most recent payments had been made from that they should have taken the payment from. Without ever receiving any notification by email, letter or phone call, that the payment did not go through or that there was still an outstanding balance, we were informed by our mortgage company that suddenly in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Capital One started reporting our status as late. Even though they have record in their own files that it was closed in XX/XX/XXXX and that payment had been attempted. They then agreed to listen to the phone call to determine how the mistake had been made by the agent. After "" supposedly '' listening to the call they informed us that they decided that they would not remove the lates and refused to give us any details of the phone call or the reasons why. We could not have possibly verbally given them the account # for the XXXX account because we had not used that account for over 4 years. I say "" supposedly '' because they were unable to give us any details of the phone call and why they made that decision. This was clearly a mistake by the agent over the phone and we feel that it is unethical for them to ruin our credit report and prevent us from buying our dream home because of their error. Our payment history was perfect up until we closed this account and we still have a different Capital One Venture card which also has perfect payment history. In fact, on the same day, we closed a XXXX Capital One card which was also showing up as late XX/XX/XXXX, which upon further review in the last few days, they realized that it had not been late, was paid on time and then closed, so they agreed to remove that incorrect late status within 24 hours. The last agent I spoke with, was rude and cold and just kept repeating the same thing, that even though he did not know "" why '', they "" have concluded that is was not their fault and that they would not be removing the lates. '' To be treated so badly by a company that we have paid thousands of dollars to over the years is outrageous. Regardless of whether or not they admit their mistake and take responsibility for it, all agree that there was a mistake and confusion of some kind in regard to payment attempted in XX/XX/XXXX and shows "" closed ''. This agent said he was the "" top guy '' and this his boss did not speak to customers. And basically had an attitude of disrespect and blatantly did not care about the situation and the fact that his company, through no fault of our own, has negatively impacted our financial situation and has kept us from being able to finance and buy our dream home. This is unjust that they should have so much power over our financial future. This hardship that they have caused is devastating and will affect our lives negatively for years to come. It seems to me that they should have some legal obligation to contact a person who tried to make a payment and close account before they begin to report to the credit bureau. He stated that I "" should '' have received statements by email, which I did not. If they were willing to remove the other error, regardless of who takes the blame for this nightmare, I do not understand why they refuse to remove the errors that are destroying our credit report. We feel that we are being penalized and punished for choosing to close our credit card. We ask that they reconsider and treat us respectively as the long time customers that we are."
Capital One,Unauthorized charges were charged on my credit card. I have been contacting them every month and told them I did not make these charges that they were fraudulent. They send me letters that they are investigating and keep charging me interest and late fees. Credit reporting agencies have lowered my credit score.
Capital One,"On XXXX, I opted out of receiving unsolicited credit card offers by calling the number provided by Federal Trade Commission. Today, XXXX, I received an unsolicited credit offer from Capital One XXXX Rewards, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Virginia XXXX. Capital One has violated another opt out I placed a decade ago.

Capital One,"At the end of XXXX of XXXX I have lost my job, I have phoned capital one and asked if they could work postpone my payment for couple of month until i find a new job.

Sadly life happens I lost a job at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and my boyfriend died of XXXX. Our money were in XXXX account.

Capital One,"I always pay my balances in full. I went online to pay my account balance two days over due. I checked the box that said pay last statement 's balance which was {$740.00}. To this balance they added the charges for XXXX that had not yet come due totaling {$1600.00}. When I questioned them about it they said the payment was being processed, and there was nothing they could do about it."
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I purchased XXXX First Class, round trip tickets from XXXX to XXXX on XXXX using the Capital One Rewards Travel website. The tickets were purchased as a birthday present for my wife, but our entire trip was ruined by Capital One 's fraudulent activity. 

On Saturday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the day we were supposed to depart for XXXX ( after flying all the way across the country from XXXX XXXX to XXXX ), I tried to check into our flight. Once I reached the seat selection screen on XXXX 's website, I was only given the option to select Premium Economy seats notwithstanding the fact that I clearly purchased First Class tickets as evidenced by the attached reservations from the Capital One Reward Travel website. I immediately called XXXX to ask why I could not check into First Class, and they said the tickets in their reservation system showed up as Premium Economy, not First Class. The XXXX agent said I would need to discuss the discrepancy with whomever I purchased the tickets from. 

I immediately called the Capital One phone number listed on my reservation receipt and spoke with XXXX XXXX, Agent Sign XXXX in XXXX, PA. I explained the problem and asked that she put us in First Class on the flight we were booked on, or the other direct XXXX flight scheduled earlier that same day. After spending over an hour on the phone, XXXX told me that despite my reservations clearly stating that I purchased First Class tickets, there must have been a computer error and she could not do anything for me. I then asked to speak with a supervisor, and she refused. XXXX then proceeded to tell me that my only choices were to accept a refund or pay to upgrade my tickets from Premium Economy to First Class!"
Capital One,"I have XXXX different Capital One Credit Cards, accounts ending in XXXX and XXXX. Capital One is reporting late payments on both of my accounts. I have disputed the late payments and asked for them to please provide me with the date the accounts became 30 days late, the date that I called them with my payment or hen th payment was withdrawn from my bank and the date the payment was credited to my account. I have sent 3 different letters to Capital One Bank in XXXX XXXX XXXX and the response I get back from them is : "" We have confirmed the late payments. '' They are refusing to provide proof that the payments were indeed 30 days late and are refusing to provide me with information that I, as a consumer, am entitled to receive under the law. I have never disputed that the charges are mine nor have I stopped payment on the accounts, all I have asked is that they provide me proof that the 30 days late payments they are reporting are correct. Since they have refused to do so on several occasions, I believe that they do not have proof that the accounts were paid 30 days late. Capital One Bank is know for holding payments for a day or two if the deadline for 30 days is close. Do I admit that I have come close on those dates that they are claiming 30 days late, yes I have no problems admitting to that, but every single time I have made a payment I make sure to ask : "" This will not put my account into 30 days late correct? '' And every single time I have been assured by their Customer Service Representative, "" No, you 're paying within the 30 days so you will not be late ''. I feel that Capital One Bank is not being up front and honest and providing a customer with what they are required to do by law."
Capital One,"My Capital One credit card account ending in XXXX went to collection around XX/XX/XXXX. Account got closed and I started getting call from a collection agency named XXXX ( XXXX ) around XXXX XXXX and XXXX told me that my capital one account was closed and had gone to collection and now XXXX was handling the account. I made the payment to XXXX for total balance and believed it to be all resolved. I also received a letter from XXXX stating that I had made full payment on my capital one account. Fast forward in XX/XX/XXXX, I did my credit score check and found Capital One balance of {$60.00} lingering on my credit report for many months. I disputed the amount but got no result from CRA or Capital One. Now, when I call XXXX, they would not even take my call and instead refer me to Capital One. When I call Capital One, they say XXXX already closed my case. Due to this erroneous reporting of {$60.00} balance occurring for many months, my ability to obtain credit fairly was restricted. I had no choice but to call Capital One and pay the {$60.00} to prevent further damage to my credit. However, I still believe that by unfairly reporting {$60.00} in my CRA reports, I was forced to pay the amount. Furthermore, it damaged my credit reputation. I request CFPB to ask Capital One to look into this matter in detail and correct their mistake, and remove erroneous reporting from my credit report."
Capital One,"In XXXX XXXX I contacted Capital One and it vised them I was unable to pay do to the fact that the Veterans Administration was unable to pay me for XX/XX/XXXX because they Could not get my money Direct Deposit into the Bank in the XXXX XXXX! I contact them several times and told them I would pay no problem and was told by a supervisor no problem they would work with me! Later that month it showed up has past due late payment on my credit report, I called back to Capital one was told they would correct it on XXXX XXXX XXXX and report it to the Credit bureaus. Later I called back she told me to wait for the next reporting date for it too show up on the credit reports as corrected. I called back today on XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked to talked to the executive team and was told I was unable to talk to them they transferred me to other Supervisor and she told me That it was not corrected in the System and it would be corrected? but was Disconnected I called back they connected me To the Military Dispute team I talked to XXXX and he stated it was in the System that it would not be corrected!

Capital One,"We booked XXXX round trip tickets from XXXX to XXXX with XXXX Capital One credit cards ( paid partially with reward points and credit card charges ). During our trip flying from XXXX to XXXX, we missed our flight due to mis-communication with the airline company. We contacted Capital One trying to resolve the problem because Capital One also served our travel agent. Since we called Capital One travel department during their non-business hours, someone from their Card Customer Service Department promised to help us. We planned to book XXXX way ticket with a different airline to replace the XXXX flight that we missed, so we can still keep the return flight with XXXX. However, the representative from the Capital One Card Service Department mentioned Capital One will able to refund us the whole trip with XXXX. Instead of purchasing another XXXX way ticket, she advised us to purchase XXXX full round-trip tickets with a different airline. She said Capital One can not refund partial trip, but they can refund full trip. Therefore, I should purchase full round trip tickets with different airline instead of just XXXX way trip. She also mentioned she will place a note on my account, so her co-workers will able to help when I call back for the refund. The next business day, I called Capital One to process the refunds that they promised. I was connected to their travel department first, then their card service department, then their specialist and finally back to their travel department. They transferred my call around for almost 2 hours, and they were not to honor what they promised originally. No proper documentation was input in my account. They recorded my conversation with the original representative. And they made me liable for the misleading advise that the original representative made. Instead of paying for one-way ticket from a different airline ( approximately {$750.00} ), we have paid {$1700.00} extra for another full round trip tickets. We have purchased XXXX set of full round trip tickets for the same trip due to the misleading advice from Capital One Card customer service. There is evidence from the conversation record in the system. And they are not willing to retrieve the record and be liable for the mistake they made."
Capital One,"i disputed a charge, was given credit but then t was rebilled even thought i never rec 'd the item. spoke with a number of agents & dispute supr. at Capt I. they informed this happens all the time, i 'm in the process of writing a detail account of problem even so they have recorded my disputes.\ phone calls i was also told i would be rebilled for XXXX item of XXXX"
Capital One,"I received a Capital One Business Credit Card that was suppose to be reported only on my business credit reports but to my surprise I was notified by XXXX that the Business card was being reported on my personal credit reports. This is a violation of the FCRA, FCBA and FDCPA. I called an spoke to a Rep. Name XXXX out of XXXX Florida and he said they are required to report it on the personal and business credit and I advised him that I was told that it would only be reported on my business credit report and only on my personal credit report if the business defaults on the credit card."
Capital One,"I saw Capital one commercials that blank the national TV about XXXX dollar spending for XXXX miles. 
However, these miles are not equivalent to any miles used by airlines ( reward earning by flying ). This should constitute the AD is a false advertising to deceive consumers."
Capital One,"I have a consumer credit card with Kohls.com and buy products from them and pay off the card. When a product does not work, does n't fit for example, they will not issue a credit on the card. They issue a merchandise credit that requires buying more to get the value back. 

I do n't like it. And especially in this last case, I ordered women 's shoes size XXXX, they did n't fit, and there was no paperwork to return them, XXXX paperwork. I called. They were not helpful, said they did n't have to provide paperwork. Drive XXXX miles to return them at store, they issued a card for purchasing from Kohls to compensate. I ordered size XXXX and waited, what came was men 's size XXXX, and while my name and address were on outside box, paperwork in the box showed it was a sales to another customer, in XXXX ( I am in XXXX ). Their error, not mine. And I communicated, and then after Kohls told me it would be picked up I have received two messages via email asking me to take it to the store XXXX miles away. I told them they can pick them up if they want them, and I do not accept charges for the order that I did not place for size XXXX men 's shoes."
Capital One,I HAD RECEIVED A VISA CREDIT CARD # XXXX FROM CAPITAL ONE AND ABOUT XX/XX/2016 THEY PLACED RESTRICTION ON MY ACCOUNT & NOT ALLOWED ME TO USE THE BENEFITS THE CARD GOT TO OFFER UNDER CASE # XXXX. I HAD SUBMITTED ALL DOCUMENTATIONS FOR PROOF OF MAILING & PHYSICAL ADDRESS AND THEY INSISTING ON THREE WAY CALLS WITH MY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO INQUIRED PRIVATE BANKING INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACCOUNT WHERE THE PAYMENT ARE MADE ELECTRONICALLY. THEY ARE VIOLATING ALL MY FEDERAL PROTECTION RIGHTS IN REGARDS BANKING. I NEED TO HAVE MY ACCOUNT RE-ACTIVATED IMMEDIATELY PLUS ALL REMEDIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE E-MAIL & PHONE CALLS.
Capital One,"In XXXX 2015 I applied for a Capital One card online and a hard inquiry was done on XXXX XXXX. I was told that I would receive a letter in the mail in a few days with their decision. From the end of XXXX through the end of XXXX I never heard back from Capital One in regards to my application. I called them on XXXX XXXX 2015 and explained to the specialist over the phone that I had never received any letters from them. It turns out that they were sending the letters to my residential address ( where I currently can not receive mail, instead of my mailing address, a XXXX XXXX that was provided, saying they need proof of income. The specialist told me that my deadline to submit proof of income was XXXX XXXX 2015 and provided with me with a fax number to send my documents to. I emailed my employer about the proof of income and I was given the income letter on XXXX XXXX. That same day I went to a XXXX copy center to fax the information. I followed up with Capital One that night and over the next few days and was told they received my documents via fax and that I was approved for the card. We found out that one of the specialists did n't change the mailing address. I always provide my mailing address over the phone if I 'm unable to enter the information online. I did n't receive my approval email until XXXX XXXX 2015 and I did n't get my card for a while after that. The issue is that after I faxed my proof of income, Capital One did a hard inquiry on XXXX XXXX 2015 for the same application from back in XXXX. I NEVER sent another application in XXXX. Since XXXX 2015 I been fighting Capital One, contacting them numerous times by mail and phone, explaining what happened and how my credit was affected twice for the same card. I requested for the hard inquiry on XXXX XXXX 2015 to be removed as the hard inquiry on XXXX XXXX 2015 was truly used for my credit card approval. Capital One has refused to do a proper investigation and provide details and results of that investigation. They continue to refuse and ignore my request. This is the only way I can get in touch : I write a letter providing proof, they sent you an automatic letter about opting out of inquiries that has nothing to do with your case and does n't even state they 've received your dispute, and that 's it. I have to call THEM, request a supervisor, ask a supervisor to escalate the issue, and if they actually did it, then you wait for that department to call. They call you ONCE, if you 're are n't there, they leave a general voicemail and claim they have reached out several times.They simply leave a "" note '' on my account saying the inquiries are valid and that 's it! In my last two detailed dispute letters I sent to Capital One, I sent them extensive proof supporting my position. Since we used my domestic partner 's XXXX card to pay for the fax, I contacted my domestic partner 's bank and our cell phone carrier to help me with this. I have two call logs showing several calls between Capital One and myself. You can see on the call details log for my number showing I spoke with Capital One on XXXX XXXX 2015 at XXXX. That was the same night I emailed my manager at XXXX asking her to give me the proof of income letter. You can then see several follow up calls to Capital One made from my phone and also using my partner 's phone. Lastly, on the bank statement you can see the XXXX purchase of when we went to fax the income letter to Capital One on XXXX XXXX 2015. We paid {$4.00} to have those documents faxed. They refuse to remove the inquiry and claim they have done a proper investigation without providing me any details or results. I spoke with a supervisor today who refused to escalate the issue. 
I need access to my recorded phone conversation on XXXX XXXX 2015 at XXXX. Then you can hear the specialist telling me the deadline date."

Capital One,"Capitol One Bank XXXX The creditor did obtain a fraudulent judgment by filing an illegal lawsuit against me. Further, the judgment is now expired yet the creditors collection agency is still trying to collect on the illegal judgment. The creditor filed a lawsuit supported by a fraudulent "" affidavit of Debt '' which was "" robo-signed '' by the creditor 's employee. No actual verification of the actual amount owed was undertaken by creditor. 
Further the judgment has now expired yet the creditor and their agent are still trying to fraudulently collect upon this debt."
Capital One,"I had XXXX Capitol one credit cards, as you can see if made reg payments on both, I became unemployed and I noticed that I saw charges on both I never made.

My account was sent to XXXX and then to XXXX XXXX XXXX, I tried explaining what happened and the attorney for XXXX XXXX would n't let me explain, hence I have something filed at the court house in XXXX county, NC. I am trying to fish my credit, but hard to get anyone to follow through. Can you help. Me"
Capital One,"I took a hit to my credit bureau report for a deceptive reason : I went through the checkout line at KOHL 'S department store on XXXX and was asked if I wanted to apply for a credit card. I initially said no. Then was advised I could get 30 % off my purchases if I applied. I again said no, but upon thinking of the discount I would receive off my {$160.00} purchase I then was convinced to apply. Upon being approved and final checkout, I noticed there was no discount. I inquired and the manager or lead came and gave me a {$0.00} discount as you can see from the receipt I included in this email. I was then told you ca n't get a discount on Levi jeans. The cashier is then co-signing this information. This strikes me a surprising that the cashier is now telling me this information as XXXX out of XXXX of my items are Levi jeans. Unhappy with this the manager/ Team lead person reminds me I did get 30 % discount off the {$2.00} shirt. Still unhappy and voicing my opinion about it. She then tells me "" If I do n't want the card I can just pay for it all with another method of payment '' I then proceeded upstairs to return all the merchandise. I think it should be noted of this UDAAP violation as it would be a deceptive practice."
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX I HAD multiple failed attempts to a remove a 30 day late payment due to a financial hardship and also a mistake with customer service in which they waived the late payment fee however failed to explain that it will be included in the next month 's minimum payment caused me to fall behind. I decided to open a XXXX dispute. I was contacted almost immediately by someone I believe in the executive office who said she expected to get back to me the following Monday and if not way before XX/XX/XXXX. I am still in the same situation and today is XXXX XXXX, 2016 and I have yet to receive a call or response at all. 

I recently applied for an apartment because I have to move urgently however was denied because of a 30 day late payment from you guys I would like have it removed I have tried to always keep my account up date and it is negatively affecting me emotional and physically because i do n't want to end up in the street with a XXXX year old due to not being approved to no apartment. I have disputed it many times and I have been told by different representatives that yes it would be removed and nothing. I had a financial hardship but since then have always made payments. I 'm very disappointed that you would rather see a customer go and its seems as the customer is not important all that is important is the money to be made."
Capital One,"Capital One sent a pre-approved credit card mail notification to the an address I have never lived at ever and to address to a name that is not accurate for me. 
This letter could have started fraud and identity theft."
Capital One,"I paid my credit card on time and paid the balance in full every month. 

Now Capital One is saying there is fraudulent activity on my account because They are making no interest on my account. Although my account is paid in Full I ca n't use my account because they say they have to investigate fraudulent Activity. 

Capital One is Discriminating against me because I am XXXX. I want An investigation into Capital One policy of Discrimination against XXXX Who pay their bills on time and they do n't make any interest on them.

Capital One,Capital One bank took money out of my account through an ACH transaction on XXXX XXXX. The Ach Trace Number is XXXX. My credit union states it was from an online transaction. I have been behind on my account and it was closed after my son got XXXX last year. I am paying them {$50.00} a month but they took out {$1000.00}. My mortgage payment. I searched the web and this seems to be a practice that they do a lot. I have not made a payment to them through the account they took the money from for quite some time. I ca n't believe they would have the ability to just take money as they see fit.
Capital One,"Capital One blocked my credit card because I redeemed miles on the account. To verify the account they demand ID, front and back, Social security card front and back and a utility bill. I consider these demands for verification onerous and absurd. They will "" unblock the account '' after 72 hours! No other bank engages in such demands."
Capital One,"In XXXX 2016, my Capital One credit card number was stolen after placing an online food order. Multiple flights and vacation packages were purchased from different companies. Many of the charges were refunded, but XXXX were recharged to the account in XXXX 2016. I have called the fraud department approximately every other week. The previous employee, XXXX, no longer works there and her voicemail states this. During the most recent phone call, Capital One promised my account balance would be cleared to XXXX. This has not been the case, and the balance for the fraudulent charges plus interest charges are still being charged to my credit card account."
Capital One,I was checking on my balance of {$2000.00}. The installments have been made before due dates but I noticed lately that a late payment fee is being added to the account of {$30.00} every month ... Every payment has been made on time ...
Capital One,"I opened a "" Kohl 's '' charge account which I always have paid more than the amount due. I did not always receive my bill on time, a few times I had been late. I found that I was being charged more than what I owed because of them adding a very high late charge, when I had already sent in the payment. The last time I got XXXX of these late charges I paid it with a small balance on my account. I owed nothing. Next thing I know they send me a bill with a late charge as the balance and a interest amount on top of it. I contacted them and told them what was going on and they just kept trying to collect it, I then received another bill and a phone call, on the call I explained to them what had happened and they told me that there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a supervisor, when I did I explained that my bill was already paid off in whole and that their whole balance was in late charges added after the fact. She said she would take XXXX fee off but not the other. I told her I would not pay either XXXX. I recently received another bill with the amount showing an additional charge for delinquency and they also reported me to the credit agencys to drop my credit score. This is why I stopped getting credit cards prior. This kind of abuse of their using my account to try to make money they are not owed. I also told them that I would not pay for late charges after my bill had already been paid in full and I was reporting them."
Capital One,It has been reported on my credit reports that I have an account with Capital One bank that is not my account. I received a letter from Capital One bank stating that they purchased the account from XXXX and that this is my account. I contacted Capital One Bank again today online and when asked to verify my birth date they stated that was not the birth date on my account. The reason is because this is not my account. I have previously had accounts with Capital One that have been paid ans closed. I never had an account with XXXX. This is not my account and I would like this information removed from my credit report asap.

Capital One,"1. I have XXXX inquires from capital one on my credit report and I only applied once. I have disputed the inquires with the reporting agencies and they say they are legit. They are not. I had a freeze on my account until last year I removed it and started cleaning my credit and did n't apply for anything until XXXX 2016. So to rebuild my credit I applied for a capital one card and was denied but the reasons in the denial letter are incorrect. 1. it says based on your credit report from XXXX, there are too many delinquent past or present credit obligations. ( the only thing on XXXX is my car never missed a payment a collection from comcast that has been disputed and removed from all the other agencies but XXXX. and XXXX paid tax liens from years ago that I have asked many times to be removed they are paid and released. 2. Based on your credit report from XXXX, number of delinquent past or present credit obligations. Again all that is on transunion is my car never missed a payment and the XXXX paid released tax liens Nothing else. 
3. based on your credit report XXXX, number of collection accounts. there is XXXX that is in dispute and was found not mine by the other XXXX reporting agencies but XXXX refuses to remove. 
4.based on your credit report from XXXX, your credit bureau report has missing information about an account or accounts. ( I do n't understand this at all I check it every day and everything is there. 
If your going to deny the credit at least get the information correct. and stop auto inquiring my account. because the inquires are killing my score.

I told him that I did not know how to trade and he replied not to worry that he would give me the winning trades and in 2 months he will have given me trades exceeding the required amount. I started researching and saw horrible reviews on XXXX XXXX and their tactics, I asked him to send me my funds back, he said that he could not because he had given me a bonus, the funds were intact in the account all he had to do is back out the bonus and send me my money back, he did n't and he said that he was not going to be able to give me trades for 3 weeks because he was going on vacation that he was going to have someone call me, a few days later I received a call from a female trainer who gave me a 15-20 min instruction on how to trade and that is the last I heard from XXXX, I called and emailed several times in the following days and I received no response ever again, they kept my money and closed my account. I protested the charges to my credit card and XXXX XXXX Visa helped me, I got {$5000.00} but Capital One did not help me with the remaining {$6000.00} and they told me that they could not do anything, basically I am losing {$6000.00} because the actions of these thieves."

No one informed me that i was getting a new account or this would casue me to lose the {$500.00} in points. They escaleated it to the highest complaint and said yes, they are aware they forfeited my {$500.00} but there was nothing I could do about it. They admitted they gave me misinformation. They closed my account, left me a {$900.00} bill and took my {$500.00} in points away."
Capital One,I have mailed dispute notice to Capital One requesting verification of this account reporting on my credit report and they have yet to respond with a proper answer nor did they send proper verification and never stopped collecting according to 15 U.S.C. 1681s 2 7a.
Capital One,Over a year ago I transferred balances to Capitol One hoping to save on finance charges while I paid off the principal. Capitol One still charges finance charges even though I pay on time every month. I contacted them and they are unwilling to help me with this. I can not afford the finance charge. I owe {$2000.00}. The due amount only goes higher. I transferred my balances to Cap One in hopes that I could resolve my debt.
Capital One,"Although Capital One states that they sent statements to me in XXXX 2016 and XXXX 2016. I never received these statements. I have been issued a 30 and 60 day late payment notification against my credit report which has negatively impacted my credit score ( I was notified by my lender while trying to refinance my home ). The late payments are for a minimum payment ( in XXXX ) and then a minimum payment with a late fee and interest. Essentially a {$67.00} past due in XXXX and {$120.00} ( XXXX past due plus late payment plus interest ) charge in XXXX. Over the course of 10 years with this card, I have always pay this card in full. The issue with the Capital One program is, if a user has a {$0.00} ( XXXX ) balance, a statement is NEVER sent out by Capital One. Essentially, a monthly statement is NOT sent out to me each month. I use this card on rare occasions so a monthly statement is n't something that I expect to see. When I received a statement in XXXX of 2016, like other months and statements, I paid the balance in full. I have spoken to Capital One to try and resolve this miscommunication, however, they have told me to, "" Take it up with the credit bureaus because they sent statements and we do n't believe in reversing or removing anything that we have already submitted. And although we completely understand how this has hurt your credit, we do n't have any type of grace program that allows us to remove any late payment notifications. You can write a letter our Credit Bureau department if you still disagree with us. '' Yesterday, I noticed one of the bureaus removed the negative merit from my record. After talking to the XXXX of the credit bureaus, they advised me to contact Capital One to try understand why the negative merit was removed from one of the bureaus records, but remained on the other XXXX. Again, I was told by Capital One, "" We have nothing to do with that. If you have an issue, please write a letter to our Credit Bureau department. '' I have now been trying to resolve this issue for over 3 weeks and have spent more hours than I can keep track of. Capital One 's unwillingness to work with their customers to resolve a simple miscommunication shows me that their policies and procedures are skewed to ensure they protect themselves and hurt their customers. In all my years of owning my own company and working with creditors and lenders, I have never felt so disrespected or bullied."
Capital One,"Capital One recently canceled my credit card without providing me with an explanation. Capital one called me two weeks ago and said there was suspected fraud related to my card and I needed to upload personal documents online in order to verify my identity. The documents requested were : a copy of my passport, the front and back of my social security card, and a bank statement. I provided the documents through their online portal and received a call the next day notifying me that I should call them. When I called them I was told that my account was permanently suspended because of fraud related activity. I asked them for an explanation, but was told they can not provide XXXX. I asked why a fraud investigation was being conducted in the first place and I was told they can not tell me. Prior to receiving the initial call there was no suspicious activity on my account. I 've held a card with Capital One since 2007. In the end the only answer they gave me was "" I 'm sorry Sir your card is permenantly suspended, you may apply for a new card. '' My concern is two-fold. First, I deserve an explanation for why my account is being canceled. I 've never had a late payment the entire time I 've held the card. Second, if Capital One did indeed find fraud related to my account I would like to know so that I can take action to ensure my other accounts are no compromised. What can I do to obtain information as to why my account was canceled?"
Capital One,"Capital One Bank USA NA is reporting on all XXXX credit bureaus under my name. I am XXXX XXXX and I live at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX. I previously resided at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. The person who opened up this account in my name, using my SSN has been identified by the XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXXXXXX. I have informed this credit card company that I 'm a victim of identity theft and that this account was opened fraudulently in my name. They have in turn sent me a letter stating that I did in fact submit an unsolicited on-line application for this credit card on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and that I live at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX The letter says that I submitted this application using my name, DOB, and SSN but at this XXXX, XXXX address. I have never lived in XXXX, XXXX, and have never stepped foot in the state of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX lives at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and has previous applied for and obtained a XXXX XXXX of XXXX and a XXXX XXXX in my name using this address. I have since gotten the XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX removed from my credit report as fraudulent accounts. However Capitol One Bank refuses to remove this fraudulent account from my credit report. It is ruining my credit and I have no way of getting the person who has stolen my identity to stop using it."
Capital One,"My credit line with Capital One is {$5000.00}. I try to keep my balance below XXXX % so it does not affect my credit score. However, that is just about impossible with a business credit card. Therefore, I requested a credit line increase. Capital One denied my request, citing "" A credit limit increase is currently not available upon request because Capital One is evaluating account activity at assigned credit limits. '' I contacted Capital One this morning for a further understanding/explanation for this denial. The customer service representative, XXXX, stated he was not allowed to provide additional information. His supervisor, XXXX, told me I need to contact the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection for further information. 
My credit score ranges from XXXX - XXXX. So I am sure you can understand why I am concerned and equally troubled by Capital One 's response. Nonetheless, I called Capital One again this afternoon. I explained to the supervisor, XXXX, why I requested a credit line increase. XXXX stated the impact of exceeding my credit line by XXXX % to XXXX % "" is not a concern to us. '' XXXX confirmed this was a decision made by their automated processes and she refused to send my request over to the underwriters for a manual review. 
As a result, I understand if I cancel my credit card it will have a negative impact on my credit score. Also, If I exceed the XXXX % threshold it will have a negative impact on my credit score. I have been a loyal Capital One customer for a number of years. I have personal and business credit cards through Capital One, I have financed a number of vehicles and mortgages through Capital One - I have never had a late payment. With that said, I can only conclude I am a victim of racial and national origin discrimination based on the ethnicity of my last name. I request that you open an investigation into the lending practices of Capital One. If you need additional information, please contact me at XXXXXXXXXXXX."
Capital One,"This is a follow up to a complaint I filed with the XXXX about Capital One over a capital one card ( # XXXX XXXX. 

After repeated attempts to resolve my credit card balance with capital one and been mistreated, mislead, lied to and had my credit destroyed ... Capital One just recently sent my account to a company called XXXX ( XXXX ) ( ref. # XXXX XXXX XXXX contacted me saying they were now collecting, although they were very elusive when I tried to get them to admit that they had simply bought the debt. 

They tried to convince me to pay a certain amount by a certain date otherwise it would hurt my credit. They were not specific about how it would hurt it, they simply used that threat to try and convince me to pay what they wanted when they wanted it. They would n't negotiate, they did n't care about the circumstances. 

How is it legal for a company to sell off debt to another company which then has the power to further hurt one 's credit ... .without any of the context of the problem or without any due process? 

This new company refused to negotiate and continues to call me. I told them the situation and made them a more than fair offer, despite the fact that this debt should be settled with Capital One. They did n't even consider it. 

So basically, Capital One XXXX me over again."
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX I submitted on a web page to try a product for a trial period. The trial period was 18 days. On Sunday XXXX XXXX ( 18 days later ) I attempted to contact the business to cancel but no one was in the office. I called back on Monday ( XXXX ) but got the answering machine again. I then contacted Capital One ( my credit card merchant ) to get their help. The capital One representative called the business in question only to receive the same message I had gotten that no one was in the office. On Tuesday I contacted Capital One and we talked to a representative from the business in question. The rep advised that I had not canceled in time. She said there would be no refund. I hung up but checked my calendar and realized I had called in time. So Capital One and I called back. We went round and round and finally she offered to refund me half of my money. I told her I was not happy with that but to send it. 
I am writing this because I truly feel that I have been wronged. The trial period started after I made the transaction on the XXXX. 18 days later is Sunday XXXX XXXX. No one was in the office so I could not cancel. No one was in the office on Saturday XXXX XXXX so I was really only given a 16 day trial period. Is n't this fraud? The rep told us that they had reps in the office on Monday but the capital One rep read her notes that proved a call had been made that Monday and that no one was in their office. As I have understood trials like this if it ends on a Saturday or Sunday then the trial is usually extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday. The company rep told me I should have just called on Friday. So much for my 18 day trial. Can you help?"
Capital One,"I am having an issue with a XXXX membership cancellation. I signed up for a XXXX on XXXX and informed them that I will be moving and canceling my membership on XXXX, agreeing to pay for the XXXX sessions on the XXXX date. In the contract it requires a cancelation 30 days prior which was made on XXXX. I was then charged for an additional XXXX ( {$410.00} ) even though I informed XXXX members of my move and cancelation. I have since been charged for XXXX on XXXX and was told they will charge me again for the XXXX session. Totaling {$830.00}. I now have been charged an additional {$63.00}, {$67.00}, and {$78.00} on XXXX. XXXX knew about my cancellation yet somehow decided it will be alright to charge 2 extra month XXXX ( technically 3 ) and I was told that it was my fault and that I should lawyer up. I have a screenshot of my conversation with my trainer agreeing that he spoke with his manager about canceling my membership yet I have been charged anyways. I will dispute this with the bank as well but this needs to be resolved and should not happen to other members."
Capital One,I had a credit Card with Capital One making payments on time. The autorized user charged the card for a vehicle rental that was extended beyond the time. The bill ran up to {$1500.00} that was not avail on the card. The Capital One still approved the charge after I informed them that the charge was being paid in Bankruptcy. I made several request to deny the charge and reverse the charge. I submitted proof that the charge was being paid through bankruptcy and they ignored my letters and responded that my request was over 90 days which is incorrect. This charge remains on my account causing negative actions on my report. I was advised by the bankruptcy court that they should reverse the charge.
Capital One,"Capital One continues to Report a balance owed on my account in my credit report, after this account was sent to collection/charge off in XXXX. They continue to raise my amount owed on my credit report although in collections, this continues to lower my score and shows my credit utilization is at 206.40 %. 

I have spoke with collection agency to settle debt as well as Capital One who have threatened to continue to report increasing balance if I do not pay in full. This account was to be taken over in XXXX of XXXX through a divorce decree and is not my liability at this time and is my ex-husband 's however to settle the debt so I can re-establish my own credit, I was willing to pay a settlement of which I could afford. 

However, they continue to report after sent to collections of an increasing balance. Captial One will not work with me or the collection agency to correct this debt and have removed as a liability from my credit report. As well as help settle this debt. 

How can no one work with me to accept what I can offer to pay or I can wait for the statute of limitations in XXXX and have it removed then?"
Capital One,I spoke to customer service and a suporvisor that said on the call they see it was corrected and they were going to far over the letter of good standings ( never got a fax ) and then they came back to XXXX with no change ( makes no sense ... ) it should be off my report! I have spoken to them numerous times and they say one thing than go another route ... It was from so long ago and i believed at those times it was corrected ... i do not have doc on it bc it was so long ago! But i am hoping they will finally admit what they say on phone and take OFF this inquire finally thank you!
Capital One,"To Whom It May Concern : Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and I hope your day is going well. I 'm writing because I noticed that my most recent credit report contains late payments on my Capital One account. 
I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it were n't for my job cutting my pay then I would have been able to make full payments instead of partial payments. I 'd have an excellent repayment record. I made a mistake in falling behind, but since then, I have received a pay raise and will be able to pay on time every month. 
I 'm planning to apply for a mortgage loan and it 's come to my attention that the missed payments on my record could hurt my ability to qualify. I truly believe that it does n't reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts. It would help me immensely if you could give me a second chance and make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payment fees. 
Thank you for your consideration, and I hope you 'll approve my request. 
Best, XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Capital One,I have been disputing inaccurate information that is reporting to the XXXX major credit reporting agency 's in regards to my capital one account. It is reporting as having a late payment. ( which I never was late in paying ). Recently I requested my interest rate to possibly be lowered. Capital one lowered the interest rate and sent me a letter that I would receive {$24.00} credited back to my card due to the lowered interest rate. I viewed the statment and it is showing as a late payment reversal fee. I contacted capital one as I explained that I was not late with my payment and have not received the credit back to my card they had promised. I was told that on XXXX/XXXX/2016 there was a credit for {$24.00} and on XXXX/XXXX/2016 there was a credit for XXXX cents. I explained that this is very confusing because showing on my statement it is showing as a late fee reversal. I also asked why in XXXX the XXXX then in XXXX the XXXX cents. I was told this is the credit that I was to receive for the interest rate. This is very mis-leading as it shows on my side that I was late and they gave me back the late fee. This is wrong information and also very confusing. I am submitting this complaint because I was not happy about seeing a late fee credit when I was not late. It should be listed on the statement a credit due back for lowering interest rate. This is very diseving. I am submittin this complaint because capital one is reporting that I had a late payment last year ( which I did not ). Having this deragatory remark reporting on my credit reports is affecting my credit score in a negative way. After seeing today how my statement read an untrue fact is quiet concerning to me.
Capital One,"I purchased a used computer that was described as 100 % working and never had any issues. The computer I received had defected hardware and the computer was not functioning properly. After researching the problem I ended up finding out that the seller knew of the problem and had information to prove it. I contacted the seller and he continued to lie and say he never had an issue with the computer. Not getting any resolution with the seller I started a dispute with Capital one. The seller fought the chargeback, again saying he never had a problem with the computer and that the issues I was having was due to software I put on the computer. At this point Capital One said I needed a second opinion letter to basically say that there was something wrong with the computer and I was n't making it up. I took the computer to XXXX, the manufacturer, and they ran tests and found defected hardware in the computer. They also ran the serial number of the computer and found XXXX issues reported by the previous owner. XXXX of the issues was the same issue I was having. I called Capital One on XXXX XXXX, 2016 before uploading all my information and documents that was given to me by XXXX. I wanted to confirm that I had everything that was needed for the dispute. I was told at this time that my second opinion letter was good and that there should be no issues winning the dispute with the information I had. I sent my information in and was told I should get and answer in 10 working days. After 18 days and no reply from Capital One so I called in on XXXX XXXX, 2016. They said they could n't find the documents that I uploaded to them. After a supervisor got involved they found the documents. I again asked if all the documents needed were found and that everything looked good. Again I was told yes, I provided everything needed and in two weeks I should have an answer. Two weeks go by and still no word from Capital One so I called again on XXXX XXXX, 2016. This time I was told again that the information was not found and the case has not been looked at by anyone. I got a supervisor to talk to me personally this time and I told him that I uploaded them and he said, OHHHH here they are. He put me on hold to review my information. He came back and said, yes, I can see from this information that you do have a legitimate case here but your second opinion letter was missing something. I explained to him that I was told twice that the letter had all the information need. I asked that since I was never informed of the issue with the letter, what could I do to fix it. He said there was nothing that could be done because of time frames, too much time had past from when I uploaded the information. He said that if the case was reviewed when it should have been in the first two weeks, then they would have told me to get the letter fixed but since it took so long for Capital One to find my information, the time frame when things need to be finish had already past. So even though I proved that the computer I received was defected and not as describe, Capital One closed my dispute in favor of the seller. Capital One acknowledged that I was given wrong information by them and acknowledged that my dispute case was not handle in a timely matter. It is not right that I have to pay for the mistakes made by Capital One."
Capital One,I have been with Capital One since XXXX of 2016 and i have had to go thru the XXXX just for them to increase my credit limit this month and they still have not reported to any of the credit bureaus like they are supposed to be doing an that is a breach of there terms and Agreements because they lied and i want them to report asap.
Capital One,CAPITAL ONE BANK MADE TWO HARD INQUIRES ON MY XXXX CREDIT REPORT THAT I DIDNT CONSENT TO
Capital One,"While I was working part-time between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I began receiving numerous credit card offers from Capital One. Even though Capital One knew I was struggling financially at the time, they continued to mail offers. Obviously I was unable to pay them at the time ; however, when I began working full-time, I contacted Capital One to settle all of my accounts. I was assured this would not negatively affect my credit reports and scores. I am in the process of trying to get pre-approved for a mortgage and during that process realized Capital One in fact has reported all of these accounts as negative items on my reports. I have attempted to have these items removed by disputing through the credit bureaus with no luck. I find that it is poor practice on Capital One 's part to prey on those who are struggling and introduce them to a cycle of debt. While they are still reporting these items as negative on my credit reports, they continue to mail credit card offers to me. They clearly do not care about the consumer. It is not fair that they are allowed to report negative items on my credit report yet they continue to send me credit card offers multiple times. I ask that Capital One delete all of the negative items with all XXXX credit reporting bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX )."
Capital One,"For the month of XX/XX/XXXX, my Capital One credit card was due on XX/XX/XXXX. My statement balance was {$280.00}, however, I had a higher balance from recent transactions. I paid {$500.00} from my XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and it came out of my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attachment ). Since I paid my entire statement balance, I now have no payment due until XX/XX/XXXX. I am enrolled in text alerts from Capital One for purcahses, payments, etc. At XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text saying, "" Capital One Alert : Your payment of {$280.00} is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. Contact us if your payment details are incorrect. '' I was sleeping at this time, so I know I did not schedule this payment nor did not contact Capital One until XXXX the same day. I was told that yes, a payment had been scheduled via a Mobile device and could not be canceled. I reviewed my payment history and at least since XX/XX/XXXX, I have used XXXX to make my payments to Capital One, but this time, it was scheduled from my husbands XXXX account. Back to school time and a XXXX, my husbands bank account had a very low balance that was not able to cover this {$280.00} payment. My husband called his bank and they said that nothing is pending or posted as of yet and to keep an eye on it. As soon as he sees something come through, he will need to contact the bank so they can flag it and cancel the transaction."
Capital One,"I 've had contact with Capital One Bank regarding charges being charged to my account that I disputed for day one. Capital One contacted me and informed me that a request to XXXX XXXX disputing the charges were submitted but XXXX advised them that the charge was correct. I disputed the fact that the charge was being paid in bankruptcy not that I was not aware of the charge. Capital One is now saying they can not request the funds back to be credit to my account. This dispute has been going on for two year with no results or support for Capital One. My credit card had a credit limit of XXXX how could a charge for XXXX be approved and when dispute the fact that the charges are being paid in bankruptcy, Capital One refuse to handle the dispute even when they agreed on receiving proof that the charge from XXXX is being paid in Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. Capital One continues to allow a charge that is over my credit limit remain on my account although they agreed they have proof that the charge is being paid in Bankruptcy. Capital One is reporting false information on my credit report and approving a charge over my credit limit that I dispute."
Capital One,"I explicitly needed a XXXX credit card so I could use it at Costco. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I logged into the XXXX website and shopped and compared credit cards. At the XXXX website, I clicked a link to CapitalOne to apply for a CapitalOne Venture card. ( The link did not specify the type of credit card. ) I WAS NOW ON CAPITALONE 's WEBSITE. While completing the application on the CapitalOne website, I noticed that it did not specify what type of card I was applying for, so I clicked on the CapitalOne "" CHAT '' link. I asked the CaptitalOne agent what type of card this application was for and he/she replied "" XXXX, '' so I completed and submitted my application on-line. The chat agent did NOT ask me if I had been directed to their site by a 3rd party link. The application was almost immediately accepted with a very high credit limit. 
On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I received XXXX MASTERCARDS in the mail. I immediately called CapitalOne and requested that they cancel these card and issue XXXX cards as their agent previously had confirmed. CapitalOne told me that because I had been directed to their site by a third party 's website ( XXXX ) they could only issue me a XXXX. I responded "" then why did n't your agent let me know this before I applied? '' Their response was basically that the chat agent had no way of knowing that I had been directed to their site via a 3rd party 's site. They refused to issue me a XXXX card and told me I could cancel the MASTECARD ( which I have now done ) but that I was now blocked from applying for a XXXX card from CapitalOne for six months. 
The reason I received a XXXX is either because of a direct lie by their agent ( which I doubt was the case ) or because of a shortcoming in CapitalOne 's website in that their Chat agent should have had the information that I had been directed to their site via a third party so he/she could have answered my question accurately. I made no errors or omissions in the process. The CapitalOne manager we talked to on the phone on XXXX/XXXX/2016 would not admit to any mistake by CapitalOne and refused to acknowledge the fact that their database/enterprise HAD to know that I had been directed to their site via a 3rd party 's site as that is why their system issued me a XXXX. Therefore, they had the information that could have been supplied to the chat agent ; however, they chose not to have that occur and the agent chose not to ask me if I had been directed to their site via a third party before answering my question incorrectly. 
Note : If I had gone directly to CapitalOne 's website without using a 3rd party link, the answer the Chat agent gave me, "" XXXX, '' would have been correct as CapitalOne 's manager told me that is the ONLY WAY to get a CaptialOne Venture XXXX card. 
Resolution requested : I would like to receive a CapitalOne Venture XXXX card with the terms and conditions for which I had originally applied. I do not want the application for this new card to appear on my credit report because multiple credit card applications in a short period of time will decrease my credit score further."
Capital One,"I had a subscription to XXXX. The credit card on file expired over one year ago, yet a new charge for the subscription was placed on my credit card 13 months after the card on file with merchant had expired. I called my credit card company ( Capital One XXXX ) to dispute the charge and they said since I had a subscription then I had authorized the charge. After asking how a merchant was able to charge an expired card, Capital One admitted to giving the merchant my updated card information. My credit card company provided personal information ( new card number, expiration date, and security code ) directly to a merchant and which allowed the merchant to charge an expired card. I was neither notified from the merchant that my card on file had expired, nor was I notified of the agreement between merchant and credit card company to auto-update my card information, nor did I authorize my credit card company to give my information to the merchant. The credit card company finally relented and credited my account for the unauthorized charge and I have cancelled my subscription with the merchant."
Capital One,"I have XXXX credit cards from Capial one bank. I requested to upgrade one of them from XXXX to XXXX. I revived XXXX cards. I contacted them and requested to keep the current card they said ok and everything good I can use my current card. When I login to my account I see the XXXX cards are XXXX. So I called back and they told me I have to activate the XXXX card and they ca n't give me the same offer again or make any change before 6 month. 
I refused the changes and they told me they are going to fix it. More than month passed since that happened and no changes happened."
Capital One,I AM XXXX XXXX AND I WANT TO TRANSFER MY BALANCE WITH MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY. I HAD A XXXX CREDIT LIMIT IN 2015 AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE. WITHOUT ME ASKING FOR AN INCREASE CAPITAL ONE INCREASED IT TO {$3300.00}. NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO PAY ALL THE INTEREST AND OTHER FEES CONNECTED TO THIS CARD. I NOW OWE OVER THE CREDIT LIMIT AND WHEN I MAKE PAYMENTS THEY ALL GO TO INTEREST AND THE FEES. I CAN NEVER GET AHEAD. WHEN I CALL THEM WHICH HAS BEEN OVER 8 TIMES THEY SAY THEY CA N'T TRANSFER MY BALANCE TO THE CHEAPER 0 % ON A BALANCE DUE. IN OTHER WORDS THEY SAY THEY CANT GIVE ME THERE OFFERS OF 0 % BALANCE FOR MANY MONTHS. WHY WOULD THEY WHEN THEY KEEP CHARGING ME OVER {$70.00} EACH MONTH IN FEES AND INTEREST.
Capital One,"We have XXXX Capital One Credit cards. On the same day I made XXXX large payments approx XXXX XXXX dollars total. 
XXXX released the funds but Capital One has locked both cards for one week. I paid XXXX card off in full and I feel like I am being punished for doing so. Now we have no money for this entire week and they refuse to work with us. 
My bank assures me the money was released and the items were paid. 
The worker at Capital One was XXXX XXXX He claimed he was the manager of finance and there was no one above his head to speak to, there was no complaint form nothing that I could do until Friday one week after I paid."
Capital One,"I was at a store attempting to use one of my Capital One cards and the card declined. So I tried to use another and the same thing happened. When I called the number on the back of the card they told me my cards was temporally restricted for possible fraud and I needed to submit my personal photo ID and social security card to them. I asked why but the gentleman could not explain the reasoning. I 've been a loyal capital one card holder for over 7 years. I 've always kept my balance low and have NEVER missed a payment. I also never had any misuse or fraud on the cards. The next day when I called back to find out where do I submit my ID & SS card, I was told I needed to provide an ID and SS card for every person who I ever had on my account as an authorized user. I asked why and once again I was told it could be possible fraud and I asked who would cause a fraud concern since I am the ONLY person who has/had a card for the XXXX accounts. I make the payments every single month, sometimes twice a month from my business or personal checking account. I asked again how can my account be flagged for possible fraud? I was told that information could not be given to me or what the real issue was. I was given a list of names that I needed the information for. I reinstated that NONE of the authorized users have access to the accounts. They never had their own card! I let the gentleman know that I own a business and I sometimes add clients onto my account as an authorized user in order to help them establish credit. The Cap One rep said that was fine. So, for the next 3 days I uploaded everyone 's ID and Social Security cards as I collected them. Once the last person 's information was uploaded, I called Capital One to confirm the next step. I was told a representative tried calling the day before and they chose to close ALL XXXX of my accounts. I stated I never received a call from CAP ONE or a voicemail. I asked to be connected the department that called me and the lady said they do n't take calls. I asked to be connected to a manager and she said there is nothing a manager can do, the accounts are closed and will not be reopened. Her last words was that a letter will be mailed out to me and hung up the phone. 
Why would they close my accounts on day 2 before I finished uploading the documents? This is a huge problem for me. Like I mentioned I have been a very good loyal card holder. I have never been late in the history of these accounts or any others. I keep low balances on ALL my cards. XXXX card is for business purposes only. I buy business supplied and reoccurring business charges are linked to that card. The main problem is I am in the process of purchasing a house. I received a pre- approval letter already. When Capital One closed XXXX accounts my credit score dropped tremendously!!!!! Those closed accounts lessened my buying power by making my credit utilization skyrocket up and showing a balance owed on all XXXX accounts with XXXX credit available."
Capital One,I received two phone calls from the 'capital one ' fraud department to verify I had attempted to open an account. I had not and do not have an account with capital one. The number I am worried about is XXXX. I asked them to somehow verify they are capital one and they said 'they 've never received a question like that and couldnt '.
Capital One,"Hello, I 've made repeated attempts to contact Capital One regarding the overbearing amount charged in interest on my credit card. It is currently at 24.99 %. So, if I make a monthly payment of {$200.00}, the amount of interest charged is {$100.00}. I 've asked, both on the phone and in writing, to have my interest lowered as Capital One is contributing to the balance owed. They said it could n't be done. I 've asked for supervisors to speak to. They 've told me that they ca n't "" just go and lower the interest because I ask ''. It does n't follow their protocol. I 've also asked for a detailed analysis of the account as to what old balances are remaining compared to new, assuming that when a payment is made, it 's applied to the oldest balance first, XXXX. I believe that the customer service folks at Capital One have no idea what XXXX is, as they would go back to the previous statement and see if there were product charges, then the next, and the next, which is not what I 'm asking for. I 'm looking for a report showing where and how my monthly payments are being applied, of whatever remains after they snatch interest away. 
This appears to me to be legalized loansharking, and someone needs to put a stop to this. Their idea of a late payment is XXXX made on the day which the payment is due after XXXX XXXX. Is n't the payment, by law, supposed to be processed on the date it 's made? They ca n't "" update their system '' after XXXX on weekdays?"
Capital One,XXXX XXXX credit card last year I had XXXX credit cards XXXX XXXX closed all accounts for fraud XX/XX/2016 account XXXX XXXX say on account Bal. XXXX I went in my my bank account every account is paid thought my bank account this account is not in my account XXXX XXXX is asking for money I do have the card never did.
Capital One,"Capital One received a cashier 's check by mail to be applied to my credit card balance. The account updated stating payment was received on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and posted on XXXX/XXXX/2016. Although, the credit card reflected a credit for an overpayment, the available credit on the account remained at {$20.00}. When calling to inquire about the available credit, I was informed that the payment had been placed on hold for 9 days. I questioned the legitimacy of the hold for a cashier 's check less than {$5000.00} considering REG CC requirements. I was told by the manager that a hold can be placed on ANY payment without an explanation regardless of the form of payment used. No attempts were made to verify the check. Not to mention the credit card is fully secured by my funds. When asked what the reason was for the hold, I was told no specific reason could be given and that it could be several causes. I was alarmed by the response and said that it sounded like a violation of a federal regulation. When denied credit, a reason must be given. When funds are placed on hold in a deposit account, a reason must be given. Unfortunately, Capital One states, no reason is necessary for holding funds applied towards a credit card. After attempting to reason with the manager, I was only shot down multiple times. By the time this is resolved, I 'm likely to have access to my funds. But, the idea that they can make rules that go against federal regulations and inconvenience their customers without an explanation is my concern. No business should be able to impose limitations to access of one 's own funds without an explanation."
Capital One,"I contacted Capital One to pay the balance of a credit card that had been charged off in 2010. I was instructed to speak with their legal council ( which I did ) and was offered a settlement amount. I was told that upon receipt of payment, Capital One would update the balance of the credit card to {$0.00} and that the account would be considered paid in full. I was also told that the judgement that had been entered against me would be removed. Neither of these actions has been taken and the credit reports with all XXXX bureaus still list the account as having a {$4200.00} balance and lists my credit utilization as 117 %, which is not correct. I disputed this balance and received notification from all XXXX credit bureaus that Capital One had reported the balance as {$4200.00} even though I already made the payment and they agreed to mark the account as paid in full with a {$0.00} balance."
Capital One,"I had a Capital One card with my ex husband that I thought was closed in 2015. All of the monthly bills were not being sent to me, instead they were being sent to an address that my husband had set up. He purposely maxed out the credit cards and made no payments on them. This was by no fault of mine and had no idea that the account existed. I have made repeated attempts to go thru the fraud department with Capital One to have my name removed from the account as well as attempted to have the bureaus remove the item from my report as well. This is my last hope as it is affecting my ability to purchase a home."
Capital One,"Capital One Card reports my XXXX score as XXXX, but the actual posted score reads XXXX."
Capital One,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 60 days past due as of XXXX XXXX 30 days past due as of XXXX XXXX I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Capital One,"I recently missed a payment with Capital One in XXXX and XXXX 2016. I began receiving harassing calls at my place of employment regarding the missed payments. I agreed to setup a payment with Capital One and discovered my account was restricted due to alleged fraudulent activity on my account. I spoke with several agents that were unable assist in helping to explain this issue. I spoke with a supervisor XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2016 regarding the fraudulent issue surrounding my account and was advised to provide documentation regarding a suspicious address change XXXX XXXX, 2016. 
I have n't reported any suspicious activity on my account I just missed XXXX payments on my account. I have n't requested to change my address on my account. I have n't had any issues until now that I have missed XXXX payments but, my account has had perfect payment history including an increase of my limit on my account prior to XXXX 2016 before I missed those payments in XXXX and XXXX. Why is my account restricted? Why is it that your supervisor that is paid to provide answers and represent your company in a professional manner ... .CANT! I 've always made my payments online via my checking account info which verifies who I am ... or over the phone. I do n't understand. My contact phone number may be outdated on file because my number has changed but, my address remains the same. I can provide a recent statement delivered to my current address. 
I have verified my info with several agents, my account was verified at my initial setup when I was approved for my account over a year ago, I receive statements at my current address and calls at my place of employment so, why is my account restricted?? but, XXXX refused to provide a Customer Relations Mgr 's contact information or provide an opportunity for me to address my concerns in writing ; he also refused to provide any information detailing this alleged fraudulent activity. I 'm disgusted that as your customer I 'm being treated like a criminal and being refused access to the account I am liable for and that is still currently being reported to my credit report on a monthly basis. I am uncomfortable with forwarding my SS card, ID and other personal information to Capital One when they ca n't ensure that my account or my information is SAFE or provide me with any explainations as to what is happening with my account besides that "" my address was changed to a suspicious address '' without my consent but, I have to forward info ... .although I have n't reported any suspicious activity with my account ... ..why was my account singled out?? I need some answers."
Capital One,"I wrote a letter to Capital One on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, explaining that they were reporting GOOD information for a Capital One/ Sony account circa XX/XX/XXXX on my XXXX and XXXX credit files. This information is not showing up on my XXXX credit file. I REQUESTED THAT THEY ADD THIS INFORMATION TO MY XXXX CREDIT FILE. NOT REMOVE! 
What happened next : I received a letter from Capital One dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The letter was a generic statement letter ... "" We agree that there is incorrect information on your credit report, so we asked the credit bureaus to remove this account from your credit report. '' Accounts in good standing remain on credit files for 10 years or indefinitely. This account was never delinquent. This is WHY I was requesting this information be added to my XXXX report ... it is already on XXXX and XXXX. 
I understand if Capital One does not want to report this information on XXXX, but by removing this information from XXXX AND XXXX will cause my CREDIT SCORE TO DROP. This will affect my scores by way of the credit mix ( i.e. types of loans mortgage, equity & installment ) and length of credit history."
Capital One,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : XXXX I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Capital One,"I remodeled my house ; purchased most of the materials from XXXX using their "" 6 month same-as-cash '' offers. I had numerous balances on these "" 6 month @ 0 % '' offers that expired in different months ( or incur deferred interest ). I was paying close attention to my offers and paying off those balances when they expired, and asking for anything over the minimum payment to be applied to my "" regular purchase balance '' which is charged 25.24 %! 

Capital One has a disclaimer to get around applying anything above your minimum payment to the next highest interest rate balance - they apply anything over your minimum payment to the currently expiring balance and then to the NEXT expiring promotional balance instead of applying it the next highest balance ; the "" regular purchase balance '' earning 25.24 %! 

I have asked them not do this on my account, and they tell me it 's automatic. I tell them that I am directing them to apply my payment to different balances instead ; I get the run-around every time. I have to talk to a supervisor, then I 'm on the phone for HOURS - as they try to confuse me, then eventually offer to wipe the interest fees. They never do correct the balances on the various promotional offers, so the issue never does get fixed. I have to call them back every month and go through the whole thing again. I 've spent HOURS on the phone EVERY MONTH with a different supervisor applying my payments manually. Then they still do n't apply it correctly - the balances are all wrong, when I try to get it straight, they just talk about all the difference balances, tell me the same thing in a different way, attempt to confuse me, etc. They refuse to apply my payment how I ask them to AND how it is required to be applied according to CARD Act of 2009 ; which is minimum pmt, payoff promo balance expiring that month, then apply anything over that amount to the "" regular purchase balance '' - the balance with the highest rate. 

It 's a struggle every month to request that my payment over-and-above the minimum payment be applied to the balance with the highest interest rate. 

This clause "" If you have Same As Cash Credit Plans, we will automatically apply payments received during the final TWO billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first the required minimum pmt due and next to the plan ( s ) that is expiring, in order of expiration ; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0 % APR for purposes of determining payment application. '' This allows them to pay off a balance that is sitting at 0 % for another month instead of paying off the balance sitting there at 24.25 %."
Capital One,Capital one reported me as 30 days late for a XXXX XXXX payment which is the only late payment that I have ever been reported on in the 4 years I have had the card and I disagree with this reported late payment. I have not been receiving my bills through the mail on a regular basis every now and then i do revieve a bill in the mail .do to me not recieving my bill regularly have been calling and making phone payments through capital ones phone services. The recording indicated that my payment for XXXX was due on XX/XX/XXXX so I waited till XX/XX/XXXX to make a {$500.00} dollar payment to XX/XX/XXXX payment and XX/XX/XXXX payment ahead of time and remainder towards principle. By making it on XX/XX/XXXX I thought it would cover my next month payment which I have done in the past and the system has accepted both payments crediting both months.By me not getting my bills in the mail on a regular basis I have only been able to determine my cycle through what their customer service line supplies me with which is due date of the XXXX each month. I called to resolve this issue with them and was told I signed up for paperless which is not true. I do not use the Internet especially for credit cards or for payments which my account should show that all payments have been made over the phone. When I asked them the history of the loggin they could n't give me a date other then the initial date which they said was XX/XX/XXXX which I 'm positive I did not sign up for paperless. I 've have spoke to several supervisors and it seems they are reading notes of the previous person I 've spoke to and no one 's making efforts to rectify there error which has miss led me and subsequently has caused damage to my credit score which renders refinancing my house ineffective before this happened my credit score would have been able to get my refinancing done which would save me and my family thousands of dollars a year.
Capital One,"My capital one credit card accounts are being restricted because I have added authorized users.This is something that is legal within the capital one company policy. They are asking me for information and documents about the people that I have added even though they are no longer on or with my accounts. My accounts have been opened for about two years and it will be very difficult to track them or their information down when I do n't know their current situations or whether or not some of them are deceased. When I added them to begin with, they should have just asked me for all of the required information then. I pay annual fees to keep some accounts open. Now I 'm being restricted without a clear explanation why. Capital one called me from their fraud department, but I have not committed any fraud."
Capital One,"back in XXXX 2016 was the last payment I made because of financial difficulties I started paying {$60.00} in XXXX and XXXX and they say that 's not enough. I 'm trying my best I live in a mobile home that the floors are caving in and am trying to get a new used one. Well because of them letting the whole world know that I was behind on my payments which I think is completely wrong it is keeping my scores down.This is the first time I have done anything like this. They wont even lower the interest. I am XXXX and cant do anymore than I can, i do n't want to be living on the ground"
Capital One,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 30 days past due as of XXXX 2016 I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Capital One,I got a kohl 's credit card in XXXX CA. When my first payment was due I called a representative of Kohl 's and ask them to change my billing date to the XXXX of every month to keep from getting charged late fees every month. The first time I called was XX/XX/2016 to get them to change my billing date. I was told I had to pay my balance up before they would make any changes to my account. I called them again today on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and again I was told I have to pay my balance up including any late fees. I explained my situation to them and they was not willing to work with me to resolve this issue.
Capital One,"My elderly father was a victim of fraud and financial manipulation by a timeshare company in XXXX. He lost {$150000.00} by sending a XXXX separate wires to XXXX believing he was selling his timeshare. He subsequently took a trip to XXXX and was told by the timeshare company that if he upgraded his timeshare for {$50000.00}, that he could sell it within three years for {>= $1,000,000}. He used XXXX credit cards ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) for a down payment of {$24000.00}. Once this was discovered, we put a halt to the payment. The credit card companies are demanding payment. I have claimed fraud and financial manipulation of an XXXX person, which is against the law in our state, but it does n't seem to matter. The credit card company is supporting the fraud and manipulation. We do n't know where to go for help. There does not seem to be any resource that helps XXXX victims of fraud. ANY direction that you could point us to would be very helpful. As his son, I have my fathers POA and can act on his behalf."
Capital One,"Dear CFPB officers, My complaint is about CapitalOne Venture credit card I had. I had been using this card for about two years. In this first year, it worked well so I continue to use it and paid the annual fee of {$59.00} early this year. But since then, this card became very hard to use. In XXXX and XXXX 2016 all attempts to sue this card were all declined. I call the customer service many times and spent hours on the phone, but they could not resolve this problem. In XXXX 2016 I again was declined. I called the customer service again. This time, a lady named XXXX ( Employee ID XXXX ) tried many ways but I still could not charge to this credit card. Even when she was with me on the phone when I tried to use this card, the problem was still there. Since I can not use this card, I had to close it. But CapitalOne refused to refund me the annual fee I had paid. My point is that I paid the fee for service. Since CapitalOne can not provide the service, they should refund me. After communicating with CapitalOne many times, they still refused to refund. So I have to resort to CFPB for help to get the refund I deserve."
Capital One,"In response to Capital Ones ' solicitation letter for home refinancing, I called them up and asked loan programs they have. I expressed my interest in one of the programs and asked them to send the application. They asked my credit card number to proceed. I hesitated to give, but agent said "" no charge '', "" no charge '' "" no charge ' number of times. Since I did n't sign the application yet, I assumed it will be O.K. with such a big company, so I gave them my card number. Next day I receive application forms. But before I sign I received a better offer from another company, so I cancelled the application to Capital Ones the next day. 
However, when I received my credit card statement later on, I found they charged {$450.00} commitment fee which I can not accept. At no point the agent made me understand that just giving the credit card number is an acceptance of the offer and I am subject to any commitment fee. Who would accept that kind of offer in the world unless the person is a stupid or crazy. I think this is a typical example of credit card abuse or cheating to an innocent customer. I think U.S. is lawful country and I sincerely hope you would help me to resolve this kind of nonsense."
Capital One,"CAPITAL ONE BANK USA XXXX, reported to the XXXX major credit bureaus that I was 30 days late from XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX and also XXXX of XXXX. I have had the account on automatic payments for more than the required amount due every two weeks and have since the beginning of this credit card. I have contacted them on numerous accounts to resolve this discrepancy of which none have yielded valid action to rectify their major reporting deficiencies."
Capital One,"Was in XXXX in a tour that turned out to be pressure sales tactic. 
The guide in the middle of our drive, say that if we do n't buy anything, she 'll will charge us {$600.00}. This was not an option as we were under their supervision in a van where we did n't know where we were. I figured since we were held hostage, the only way to get out was to pay her using a credit card, then afterward called the CC company to not authorize the charges, XXXX for {$590.00} and XXXX for {$3000.00}. So when I contacted CapitalOne and told them that I did n't authorize the charges they put my request in the their Fraud Department, who basically said that since I signed the transactions I have to pay. When I tried to tell them I was under duress, that I could n't do much in that situation, they refused to listen. So they basically pushed the transactions back to me."
Capital One,"Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have maintained an account with Capital One with whom I have XXXX credit cards. I have had no returned payments in that time. 

I recently moved to New York and opened a XXXX account as XXXX does not have any branches in New York. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I attempted to put my new bank account information into Capital One 's website, intending to pay the full balance of {$2400.00}. Using the bottom of a check, I entered the routing number and account number. The account information was "" verified '' ( that is, it accepted it input ) and I submitted the payment. I was given a confirmation number accepting the payment. I received emails that my account was "" linked '' and that my payment was scheduled. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received emails that my payment had been returned by XXXX because of an "" invalid account number ''. I was on my way to school and did n't have time to deal with the issue just then but that afternoon I attempted to speak with both XXXX and Capital One regarding the payment return and the invalid account number. I noticed also that my account had been closed. 

After over 4 hours on the phone, I ascertained from XXXX ( on a three-way call that included a representative from Capital One ) that I had the proper account number and routing number. Frustratingly, neither XXXX nor Capital One were willing or able to tell me the exact nature of the error. 

XXXX refused to provide me with any documentation of a requested and returned payment. They repeatedly accessed my account and informed me that no payment was made and so they had no record of a returned payment. I attempted to inform them that naturally there would be reflected in my account no returned payment as the payment was requested from an invalid account number. They did not seem to understand this and when I requested to speak with someone in an accounting or compliance role who might have a record of a returned payment, they refused to connect me. 

Capital One was only slightly more helpful. They requested documentation from XXXX of the returned payment ( see the previous paragraph ), stating that absent documentation of bank error or fraud, they could not reinstate my account. I spoke with an account manager, XXXX, around XXXX who told me that she was escalating my complaint to a review committee who would make a determination about whether or not my account could be reinstated and that I could expect to hear from them the week of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I did not hear from them in that time period. 

During that time, I realized that I had probably mistakenly mistyped my account number on Capital One 's website adding, directly from the bottom of my checkbook, a "" XXXX '' to the beginning. I am not certain of this as I have not been given documentation of my error. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I called Capital One re. the status of my request. I told them that I had probably mistakenly mistyped my account number. I was connected with an account manager who said that the review committee had declined to reopen my account, that they had adopted a strict rule re. returned payments and that a returned payment, regardless of one 's payment history or the circumstances of the return, would result in permanent account closure. I was told that all decisions were final, that the review committee did not hear further appeals, that I would be given no documentation of the decision and that I was ineligible to ever apply for another card. 

I am concerned that I have had my account closed a ) without documentation of exactly what went wrong, b ) without opportunity to correct the mistake before account closure, c ) without a meaningful opportunity to appeal closure, d ) without consideration of the nature of the returned payment, and e ) in a way that negatively affects my credit and, as a future attorney, has consequences re. my prospects of bar admission."
Capital One,"Simply stated, "" if there is no late payment, then there can be no late fee! '' Here are the facts : 1. the credit card company is charging me several late fees from XXXX XXXX tho XXXX XXXX 2. there were no late payments 3.I mistakenly made XXXX monthly payments in one month, the company did not initially credit XXXX of the payments to the following billing cycle as I had intended it to do. 
4. viewing on line my payment statements, transaction activity, and activity for this company all indicate equal payments of {$25.00} for the period under dispute 5. my own bank records verify, except for the double payment, that each month a {$25.00} payment was made from XXXX through XXXX XXXX 6. the company has made some adjustments, but continues to bill for late fees and now has the minimum payment for XXXX XXXX at {$100.00}, rather than the usual {$25.00} per month 7. I am a senior on a fix Social Security monthly income and can not afford such an increase in a monthly payment. It is a struggle to make ends meet as it is 8. I have talked to numerous representatives and supervisors who all miss the critical point that even according to their records, there is no late payment, thus no late fee charges 9. I have finally sent them a letter stating that if this issue isnt resolved to my satisfaction by XXXX XXXX, XXXX by XXXX I shall "" walk away '' from the balance owing and will not respond to any of their attempts to collect any sums of money. I own nothing from which they can collect! 

I welcome your further inquiry regarding this issue. I sincerely hope you are able to show this company the error of their "" best business practice ''. Simply because I was using good money practices by submitting XXXX payments at once, I should not be penalized with "" past due fees '' when the company 's own records clearly display no late payments!"
Capital One,"I HAVE A CREDIT CARD WITH CAPITAL ONE. THE MONTHLY PAYMENT IS DUE ON THE XXXX OF THE MONTH. ATTACHED IS A COPY OF THIS MONTH 'S BILL. I PAID MY BILL LAST NITE XXXX XXXX AT XXXX.

IF MY PAYMENT IS DUE ON THE XXXX AND I PAID ON THE XXXX, WHY AM I BEING CHARGED A LATE FEE. WHEN I CONTATED CAPITAL ONE, THEY SAID IT WAS BECAUSE MY PAYMENT WAS NOT SENT BEFORE XXXX. NOWHERE ON THE STATEMENT DOES IT SAY ANYHING ABOUT THAT. PLEASE HELP."
Capital One,"On XXXX XXXX I started getting emails from CapitalOne regarding someone else 's credit cards. On that day it was thanking the individual ( later identified as XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for updating his/her email address. The address that was entered was my business address. Since then, I have continued to get 16 additional emails despite my reporting the problem twice by telephone, and by returning EVERY email to "" XXXXXXXXXXXX '' -- including sometimes actually explaining why I was sending it back. Some days I tried to send it back as much as 9 times just to see if I could get someone to pay attention. Despite all my efforts, I am still getting these financial emails for SOMEONE ELSE! I am being informed what the balance is on XXXX of the XXXX credit cards. I am informed when a payment is scheduled. I am informed when one is due. He/She must be pretty upset that they are n't receiving their email notifications. I know that technically, I could ask to reset my ( XXXX 's ) password, and then look up this person 's address and then contact them to explain what 's happening, however, I do not want to get in trouble for a situation I did n't create.

Capital One,"Capital One is reporting an account on my credit report that was found to be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I hired XXXX XXXX, an FCRA attorney in New Jersey, and we were able to sue them and the credit bureaus, and I won.

Capital One,"XXXX Account Number : XXXX XXXX Case Number : XXXX and XXXX I authorized a XXXX card payment of {$360.00} on XXXX XXXX, 2016 during a telephone call to a XXXX XXXX XXXX, representative of "" XXXX ''. The {$360.00} payment was with respect to a 20 % deposit for a cruise vacation package. I was prepared to risk loosing this {$360.00} payment, as there was a possibility that work commitments could prevent me from taking the vacation. 
( I have no dispute with "" XXXX '' or Capital One with regards to this {$360.00} amount ). 
My dispute is based on the fact that on XXXX XXXX, 2016, without my authorization, "" XXXX '' took the balance of {$1800.00}. It would appear that the "" XXXX '' representative simply choose to process the {$1800.00} payment on XXXX XXXX, 2016, using the XXXX card number details that had previously been provided. 
During our XXXX XXXX, 2016 telephone conversation, XXXX XXXX XXXX, agent for "" XXXX '' was adamant that I had provided necessary authorization during our initial XXXX XXXX phone call, and advised that a refund would not be made. It would appear to be a case of XXXX XXXX XXXX 's word verses mine. 
When you phone the "" XXXX '' telephone number ( XXXX ) a pre recorded message advises that the telephone call will be recorded. Therefore, if "" XXXX '' are operating in accordance with their own procedure, they will have a recording of said calls.

Capital One,capital one bank suddenly cancelled my credit card account and refuses to provide a specific reason. My account had an excellent 10 year history including no late payments and a XXXX dollar credit line. My credit score is XXXX. The letter from capital one was very vague and ambiguious. Capital one also cancelled my kohls credit card that had the same excellent history. As a result my credit score will decrease. I researched the web and found numerous other people with the same situation. It is very likely capital one will not do business with people that pay their balance every month and do not generate interest revenue for this awful bank. Thank you in advance for assistance
Capital One,"I 've had this Capital One credit card for at least 6 years, without incident. My current credit score is above XXXX based on their own monitoring platform. I have not requested a credit limit increase in years. Yet, when I submitted the formal request through their site I was declined because "" Recent use of this account 's existing credit line has been too low ''. ( Something I never heard from the XXXX other cards that increased my limit by XXXX-XXXX within the last 6 months. ) When I called to ask for general guidance around this undocumented and irregular practice, it was suggested that I consult a financial adviser. This disingenuous answer was not the operator 's fault, there was a meaningful pause while she asked a supervisor. *1. ) This answer is insultingly nonsensical. How would any 3rd party have specific insight into Capital One 's secret internal procedures they are unwilling to disclose to customers. *2. ) I have used and paid the balance every month for years. It 's inappropriate to demand higher usage because low balances/usage are a key part of every credit rating algorithm. I do n't see how a minor increase in credit limit should be contingent on a customer damaging their own credit rating. * 3. ) This denial, and what it represents, illustrates that Capital One has systematically violated the basic premise of credit ratings. They start low, and increase as consumers build a documented record of constructive behavior. There are only two ways to increase one 's credit score without applying for more credit. One, wait as the average age of revolving accounts and general credit history increases. This is a very slow process when the optimal length is 25+ years. Two credit limit increases every 6-12 months based on proper usage. Again, this is the only meaningful path for responsible users to systematically increase their credit score. By actively sabotaging this vital industry standard practice Capital One has expressed their intention to dishonestly prevent upward mobility and keep their own customers trapped in the indentured servitude that is undeservedly poor credit scores."
Capital One,"I am filing this complaint against Capital One because I they are misapplying my payments toward balances with lower interest APR 's out of complaince with federal rules and their own stated policies. 

I paid {$140.00} on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to Capital One. This payment included {$68.00} to cover the minimum payment for a balance carrying an interest APR of 15.15 % ( The minimum payment was due on XXXX XXXX ). The additional {$76.00} was supposed to pay off a {$75.00} balance that was carrying an interest APR of 25.15 %. 

Unfortunately, the next billing cycle ( minimum payment due on XXXX XXXX ) showed that I was still carrying a balance of {$42.00} at the 25.15 % interest rate. 

I would appreciate if you department would look into this. According to the FAQ on the back of the Capital One billing statement, it states the following : How do you Apply My Payment? We generally apply payments up to your Minimum Payment first to the balance with the lowest APR ( including 0 % APR ), and then to balances with higher APRs. We apply any part of your payment exceeding your Minimum Payment to the balance with the highest APR, and then to balances with lower APRs."
Capital One,Requested copy of statement that show the credits that changed the reporting balance from {$2500.00} reported XXXX 2016 to {$1900.00} reported balance as of XXXX 2016. I sent a direct request to Capital One requesting the statement for that change but never received XXXX. I did receive a letter saying Capital One was going to change it but never the supporting Credit Card statements showing how the account was credited. Also could I get a verification of the correct address and furnisher name as it would appear on my credit report for account number as reporting in my CFPB complaint.
Capital One,"I purchased a car from a private party for personal us on XXXX using my CAPITAL ONE credit card via XXXX. The car was delivered without a title and numerous undisclosed issues the worst being a rusted out frame. I contacted the seller and he refused to allow me to return the item or correct any of the issues the car had. I filed a dispute through my card company. XXXX and the seller responded. My card company ( capital one ) gave me a list of things I needed to provide in response to keep the dispute open. I completed more than they asked for except for one item which was simply impossible for me to provide, that being "" A second opinion on company letterhead from another merchant in the same field stating specifically what the original merchant did incorrectly, how the problem could be corrected and at what cost ''. This was a private party sale, there is no comparable merchant that I can provide a written statement from on company letterhead. I contacted Capital One and the rep told me that is just standard wording, explain in your response why it can not be provided and that should be fine. I did that in my letter, since it 's impossible to provide. Furthermore, the seller did not deny the issues the car had, I provided photos of the rusted out frame and seller simply said 'it 's still worth what you paid for it '. I then get a letter from Capital One stating my submission lacks 'all the previously requested information ' meaning the 'second opinion ' letter on company letterhead which was not possible sincere is no comparable merchant on a private party sale and the seller did not deny the condition of the car. My contention is the request was impossible to provide leaving me sitting with a car, no title, and rusted out frame ... ... ... and out {$1500.00}."
Capital One,"On the XXXX XXXX XXXX I received a letter from Capital One notifying me that my credit card account was due to be closed because it 's activity was not consistent with the expectations for account usage. Therefore, I called their customer success team to ascertain the grounds for its closure. I spoke with one of their supervisors to obtain more information about the reason for closing my account. She explained that despite the account having regular manual payments made, multiple times a month. The account was being closed due to a couple of automatic payments being returned and the account would be closed. To date I have not been late for a single payment nor have I exceeded my credit limit since opening the account and it has been in excellent standing. I explained that the automatic payments had not gone through because I had not updated my bank settings after changing banks recently and had been making manual payments, this was the reason for the returned automated payments. 

Throughout the conversation I asked her if this was a permanent decision and would she be able to re-open the account given that payments had always been made, and covered minimum monthly payments adequately. She was unable to offer any assistance and was rude throughout the conversation telling me she was not a credit advisor and could not help my situation - quite patronizing to say the least. When I then went on to ask exactly how the "" closed account '' decision would be passed on to my credit agencies, she was unable to tell me the classification that Capital One would give for the closure. This is clearly an important piece of information for me as the account was not delinquent or behind in payments. I feel very unfairly treated in this situation as the closure both impacts my credit score and future ability to build credit. 

As an XXXX from the XXXX coming to the XXXX I have been diligently establishing my credit rating and credit history with Capital One. I am really disappointed that their decision to close my account could potentially impact my new credit rating here. In addition, I now can not use their line of credit to build and improve my overall credit rating. 

I am requesting that they reconsider the decision to close my account and keep it open in light of the frequent cleared payments and good standing of my account. Returned automated payments should not constitute grounds for closure given the good standing of my account and I should have first had the opportunity to update my bank payment details to correct this issue. I have also requested a full explanation as to why my account is being closed including citation of any breach of terms and conditions along with an explanations of the potential impact to my credit report, given in terms of how Capital One will report this closed account status to them. 

I hope you are able to assist in the matter and offer any help and advice if at all possible."
Capital One,"I maintain several credit card accounts with Capital One. On my XXXX Business Credit Card, they apparently have the option to charge a XXXX XXXX of 29.65 % if you are late for an indefinite period of time. Prior to the penalty, I was paying 12.99 %. I have a great payment history with on-time payments, but when I changed banks due to a move, I was late by 4 days, resulting in the increased interest rate. I find it egregious and unfair and would like to submit my complete dissatisfaction with this policy."
Capital One,I am starting to be harassed by Capital One credit card collections. I do not want any harassing collection phone calls from Capital One. I want this collection action by them to cease and desist from now on. My roommate has XXXX and needs his peace and quiet from these annoying calls. Capital One has already made to harassing calls on a daily basis.
Capital One,"I APPLIED FOR A CREDIT CARD ONLINE, ON OR AROUND XX/XX/2016. I WAS TOLD I WAS APPROVED FOR A CREDIT CARD AND WOULD MUCH LIKE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. I HAVE CONTACTED THE COMPANY DIRECTLY AND VERIFIED MY IDENTITY, DUE TO AN ALERT ON MY CREDIT. AS OF XX/XX/2016, I HAVE HAD THE ALERT REMOVED FROM MY CREDIT FILES, TO AVOID ANY HINDERING OF THE APPROVAL OF MY CREDIT CARD APPLICATIONS. I HAVE TRIED CONTACTING THE COMPANY AGAIN OVER THE PHONE, BUT TO NO AVAIL. MY CREDIT SCORE RANGES BETWEEN XXXX AND ABOVE. ONCE AGAIN I HAVE PROVIDED MY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING NAME, SS #, DOB, AND ADDRESS, TO THE COMPANY VIA PHONE."
Capital One,"Capital One offered a settlement to my husband on an outstanding credit card balance on XXXX/XXXX/2016. Offer was accepted verbally and bank acct # given for electronic payment in full immediately. Offer was explained over phone and we were told it was being recorded - with full disclosure of terms. Rep stated offer was good until XXXX/XXXX/2016. 10 days later, called Capital One because we realized payment was never withdrawn from account. Was told payment was not accepted by our bank ( even though other credit cards were paid recently out of same account ). We were not notified of any issue with payment. Now after 1.5 hours on phone ( 3 way call with our bank, waiting on hold etc ) manager XXXX "" just realizes '' the account is now going to 'charge off ' and settlement offer is withdrawn. FULL balance ( {$600.00} more ) is due. Capital One now says it is 'Too late ' to pay the settlement amount that we were willing to send by cashier 's check overnight if necessary. We had 4 more days to pay according to their 'Recorded Disclosure Statement '. The letter attached arrived AFTER all this and is dated XXXX XXXX and states DATE DUE : XXXX XXXX.??? These extortion practices are inexcusable. My husband was out of work for most of 2016 and just wanted to settle this debt and start to rebuild his credit. We obtained a loan to pay off the high interest debt. Capital One supposedly has a recorded statement verifying the due date of their agreement which they decided to break so they could extort {$600.00} more from us."
Capital One,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 30 days past due as of XXXX 2016 I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Capital One,"When logging into my account, I found out it is restricted so that I can not use my credit card due to potential fraudulent activity. I was never called or emailed to be alerted to this possible fraudulent activity by my credit card company or to be told that my card was put in restricted status. Upon calling my credit card company, I was told I would have to provide my Social Security Card in addition to a bank statement or billing statement and my drivers license in order to remove the restriction. I do not feel comfortable sending this information via the internet even if it is through a so-called secure link or messaging system so I asked the company to close my account. I was told that my account could not be closed and that it will remain open in a restricted status until I provide my personal sensitive information including my social security card. The company would also not release the nature of the fraudulent activity on my account. I do not feel comfortable leaving this account open and do not feel comfortable providing copies of my social security card through the internet. I want this account CLOSED and am very frustrated that the company will not close it."
Capital One,phone number XXXX calling early morning around XXXX. thought there was a law that collection calls can not be made before a certain time.
Capital One,"Capital One took my payment made on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and did n't apply the payment to my credit card account thereby leaving an outstanding balance of {$430.00}. I should have Zero Balance with a credit of {$38.00} Dollars. 
Because Capital One stole my payment of {$470.00} and did n't apply it to my account they messed up my Credit Score and brought it down to XXXX. I use to have a Credit Score of XXXX or higher. 
I went to purchase a car and because of Capital One my interest Rate was XXXX per cent and I had pay {$2000.00} Down Payment. I want Capital One to apply my payment of {$470.00} and Close the account in good standing stating the account was paid in full with no missed or late payments every month."
Capital One,"See Attached letter. I will be filing criminal charges against CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD if they not comply. It has been a week and I have not received payment of {$2000.00} and all XXXX card remain in collections. This will not only not go away until amount paid in full by XXXX XXXX, XXXX, but my four years of extreme loss due to CAPITAL ONE behavior has also cost me countless hours, and my time is worth something to me I will start adding {$100.00} a day late fees as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I have been patient for you to do the right thing long enough, this endless stalling, half baked excuses and backwoods theatrics are all I can take. I am a consumer that life is on mend due to catastrophic incidents in which CAPITAL ONE played a large part in creating more issues on top. I am documenting everything as I try to move forward and below you will see a list of things including MEDIA PRESS RELEASES to inform other CAPITAL ONE users and consumers, XXXX XXXX and the like, showing a copy of this letter and my proof, as well as hold you personally responsible for this unlawful and unjust behavior. 

FDIC and OCC was in receipt of the same XXXX page letter as you and after their review they submitted CAPITAL ONE also to CONSUMERFINANCE.GOV. 

I have spent a better part of FOUR years trying to resolve these issues, and there are more than XXXX issues. I have also been told that CAPITAL ONE has had more complaints than any other CREDIT CARD company and a lot of them were made right around same time I stopped using the cards in XXXX and you also had over XXXX class action lawsuits similar in nature. Please bare that in mind as you remember that I have tried working with CAPITAL ONE and not only are my issues similar as ones reported, but I have more of the average. 

Let me also remind you, CAPITAL ONE was given IDENTITY THEFT papers. That I also made regular payments on time, and often. And, that I called and personally canceled the cards and then sent in a last payment. Which I did not have to do with FTC {$50.00} liability per card used. 

I am listing the issues below, all of which I have proof and our witnesses for, and CAPITAL ONE has had its time to take care of this the amount of my loss, is inconceivable to what XXXX reported SECURED cards ontio of being beaten repeatedly by gangsters then identity theft and robbed of all possessions. If I do not get CAPITAL ONE immediate cooperation with {$2000.00} payment and XXXX cards out of collections, I will have to take drastic measures. I will be submitting this letter to ever XXXX, ever financial website, every government agency, the FDIC and OCC will get a copy on top of their records as well as CONSUMERFINANCE.GOV where I will be reporting in several different areas as well as XXXX XXXX, and this will go to the law firms who recently had a class action lawsuit with CAPITAL ONE as well as any other law firm handles these matters. I wanted to work with you guys but it 's been several years and I know you are just doing your job, but as you see below, EVERYTHING, I REPEAT, everything below is exactly what happened, and CAPITAL ONE has not even admitted to XXXX of these issues, rather try to find as many issues you think you can with me, to avoid all the irregular activity CAPTIAL ONE was doing. 

I am not looking for a rebuttal, just the {$2000.00} settlement and XXXX cards out of collections, unless I find out that XXXX XXXX did make a payment to you guys in which I know in next day or so and that be added to {$2000.00}. All these issues I have sent to CAPITAL ONE in past and have been verified as solid consumer issues in which CAPITAL ONE IS RESPONSIBLE, if CAPITAL ONE is gon na go through this list in hopes to find XXXX that seems like it 's a grey area for you to use to try to wiggle out of this, the issues I first present are the only ones that should have mattered and CAPTIAL ON"
Capital One,I had what I believed to be a joint account with Capital One with my ex-husband. The account was opened in XXXX ( by me and using my e-mail address ) and the current credit line was {$11000.00}. We divorced in XXXX and I have been making the payments on the account since that time. The bills come to the house that I own and all payments have been made from my individual checking account. My name is on the bills ; was on any transfer checks that were sent ; and the account appears on my credit report. My ex-husband decided to cancel the account on XXXX XXXX and was able to do so without my knowledge or consent. Capital One is saying that he is the primary cardholder and has the right to do that. This does n't seem fair as I am the one that has made all of the payments for the last 10 years and the one that made sure each of those payments was made on time for the last 16 years. It appears discriminatory to me that my 16 year credit history can be wiped out as well as the {$11000.00} of available credit being taken away from me without my knowledge and without any options for saving my record being offered to me by Capital One. I have called multiple times and written XXXX letters to no avail.
Capital One,"Capital One credit card was opened without my permission, after investigating they refused to remove the account, however I was told that if I paid the balance due on the account WHICH I DID, that they would change the status from 'Charge Off '' to "" Closed '' To date all XXXX credit agencies are still showing the account that has a XXXX balance as "" Charge Off '', I would like Capital One to change the status to "" Closed '' as was promised to me once the balance was paid in full."
Capital One,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 60 days past due as of XXXX 2010, XXXX 2010 30 days past due as of XXXX 2010 I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Capital One,"On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I purchased a service from a merchant through paypal for {$5500.00}. Paid {$3100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and then the balance of {$2400.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2016. Paypal restricted Merchants account and refused to release the {$2400.00} payment. Paypal reasoner NOT justified and they have failed to provide any genuine issues of fact but continues employee the identical policy which brought about their latest class action settlement. As a result, the merchant refunded to me the original {$3100.00}, but since the {$2400.00} was frozen by XXXX our contract was cancelled and the service I paid for was NEVER RECEIVED. I contacted XXXX attempting to resolve the issue as did the Merchant with no resolution.On or about XXXX/XXXX/2016, I contacted Capital One, explained all the facts, spent over 30 minutes on the phone going over the entire issue. Provided the terms of the contract, the rental property information and thoroughly explained that the services i paid for were not provided. Capital One originally removed the {$2400.00} charge. Around XXXX/XXXX/2016 I received a XXXX page form from Capital One requesting identical information which I had previously provided to the fraud investigator and more information which was completely irrelevant. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 Capital One placed that charge back onto my card and against my available credit. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I contacted Capital One again, the representative informed me the investigation is not completed and they will continue to investigate. However they would not remove the disputed charge of {$2400.00} from my account. They representative asked why i never returned the XXXX page form letter. I informed the representative that all the information requested was previously provided and that I have carried out everything I am entitled to do. I informed the representative that federal law and our contract requires them to remove that charge until the investigation is complete. They still refused. I also informed Capital One if they report my balance to the credit bureaus and include the {$2400.00} disputed transaction, they would be deliberately providing the credit bureaus with inaccurate information. Simply put, Capital one did n't not care and it seems they will simply do whatever they want regardless of policy, contracts or government violations."
Capital One,"For 8 weeks, I have been entering my ID and password CORRECTLY. 
But, Capital One WebSite, keeps flashing "" sending to your account '' then a web page announces "" We have hit a snag '' please try again later. 
This has been going on for 8 weeks on all XXXX of my accounts. 
5 weeks ago, someone from the tech department very ignorantly deleted all my security questions. The tech department would not reverse their actions. 
Three weeks ago, I entered all new questions and answers. 
Today, the same problem occurred and the tech department demanded that I change the security questions again INSTEAD of Capital One fixing the REAL PROBLEM. 
I called Capital One 's Headquarters and requested a vice-president of the credit card department but ignorantly as Capital One is ; the secretary sent me back to the very doofus customer service department. 
I WILL ONLY COMMUNICATE WITHA VICE-PRESIDENT AND NO OTHER STAFF. 
If not acceptable by Capital One, I want a {$30000.00} payment from Capital One just to have me communicate with me."
Capital One,"I have a credit card account with Capital One and they are not Reporting my payment of {$470.00} on my account there showing I owe {$430.00} but It should show I have a XXXX Balance on Credit Card Account. 

By not showing my payment they are effecting my Credit Score And I am not able to apply for things I need on Credit. I want You to force Capital to reflex my payment and to Close my Account showing I paid in Full. 

I know longer want to do business with such a Despicable company. 
Capital One is Dishonest and they hurt their Customer Credit Scores. 

Waiting to hear from you.

Capital One,"This company is still reporting a account on my file after i been notified that i have been a victim of identity theft and that i have all the necessary paperwork filed and police reports to support my claim. I 'm in the process of getting a mortgage and this account is hurting me and it is being listed as bankruptcy. I also have a fraudulent bankruptcy filing that I 'm working with the courts and the government to get that issue rectified. I have been dealing with this issue for years now with all my personal information being stolen such as social security number, address, DOB, phone numbers opened under my name and bank accounts opened under my name. I request this company remove my name and social from this account immediately and mark it as fraud so if i choose to do business with this company in the future this issue wo n't stop me. I have attached my police reports and FTC fraud identity theft affidavit which has a letter from the government showing that my identity was stolen in a cyber hack also."
Capital One,"Credit card account of more than {$1500.00} was paid off immediately after being sent to collections. Several months after paying off the debt, the account is still showing as an unpaid and derogatory account on my credit report."
Capital One,I am upset with Capital One and all other credit cards that promote a % return on what is spent on the card. These customers are not saving but rather running up their credit card debt. The % return only really lowers the high credit card interest rate by a miniscule amount. People do not understand this obviously.
Capital One,"We were on vacation out of the country for two months. We paid the credit card company in advance for expenses that would occur while we were gone. I arranged this and notified the Capitol one visa card in advance. While were were gone they sent a check for the positive balance we had for the second month while we were gone. When we returned home I sent them XXXX checks. I confirmed they received XXXX check. The other they stated they did not have. They told me to contact my bank and put a stop payment on the check. I did that. I requested a raise in the credit card limit. They sent me a letter stating they could not raise my credit limit due to a stop payment. I tried to explain with no resolve. I must admit I lost my cool with them during this discussion. They told me they raised my credit limit a few weeks prior. I asked them why no notification? They did not raise it, this was a lie. I told them we have excellent credit rating and I did not want them tampering with it due to all there errors. 
Our error was paying in advance in good faith. I would suggest to others to use great caution dealing with this company. I should be noted that prior to this conversation they awarded us XXXX air miles for the hours we spent on the phone with them."
Capital One,"A true personal story : I was a Capital One cardholder for some time and I paid my bills in a timely manner. Then my Capital One account got hacked and someone ordered a card to a different address and was making purchases with my card and paying with my bank account that was pegged to my capital one credit card account. 

I called capital one and they were very callous about it and they told me to just change my password and they will send me out new cards. 

Lo and behold a couple of weeks does n't go by and I notice charges appearing that were n't mine. So after investigating I realized that this same hacker must have hacked again and ordered a new card and was spending once again. Oh you bet he did but this time he got smart and attached someone else 's bank account to the account ( a XXXX XXXX XXXX account ) and was paying for the purchases with this party 's bank account. This "" hacker '' also started withdrawing money from ATM machines all over NY. 

I called capital one and again they were not forthcoming even blaming me, like it was my fault! Instead of commencing an investigation as to how my account was being hacked, they just told me to change my password and sent out new cards. 

I also spoke to the fraud department dozens of times ( each time took 30+ minutes ) and told them to please make sure my account is credited for all the unauthorized ATM withdrawals and charges. 

Capital NEVER credited me those charges. I never ever experienced more horrific customer service then my 6 month misery with capital one. They only wanted to sweep it under a rug that they were hacked. 
Capital NEVER credited me those charges. So I refused to pay my bill. I told them I will pay when they remove those charges. So they gave me the run around and sent me to other "" departments '' but never ended up crediting those charges. 

I refused to pay and this went to superior court and I was n't going to start paying lawyers and never challenged it and lost by not showing up. 

Capital One has garnished money from my account on XXXX separate occasions also incurring me overdraft charges and bounced checks because I never got a heads up when the money was going to be withdrawn. 

But those were the least of my problems. 
The guy who hacked in managed to get all my info and so began my fun 2 years of identity theft. 
I have detailed very quickly a very unenjoyable episode to say the least. It has cost me so much time, money and effort."
Capital One,"I have proof of my charges and willing to give you copies. It makes no sense to reverse the charges of my dispute with XXXX XXXX. I have called and left messages. I have not gotten any calls backs. 

I would also like to reverse a dispute and need your help, as I called twice and got no help Saturday AT ALL. I am disappointed in you guys. I thought you would not reverse charges and would be more helpful with disputes. I spend 20 mins with a customer service rep and was on hold and my phone died. I do not have a lot of time to call from XXXX. I need you guys to follow up with me."
Capital One,"I have a XXXX BIG card and made my payment when I got paid, the payment posted on XXXX/XXXX/2016. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I received a warning email that I had not made a payment on the card and if I did not make a payment by XXXX/XXXX/2016 I would be assessed a late fee. I contacted the card company which seems to be Capital One and they stated that they close a cycle on the 3rd and do not count payments made previous to that as part of the payment cycle. This feels like a predatory practice designed to incur late fees and harm consumers that are on a fixed income."
Capital One,"In XXXX 2016 I read a news article about Capital One offering their new "" Credit Wise '' free credit monitoring app for download. They claimed one did not need an acct, which I do not have, in order to sign up. I downloaded the app on my XXXX and then opened the app and started the free sign up process. I filled out the app 's forms and at a certain point the app noticed that I already had a Capital One acct and asked me for my login and email and password. I attempted to login several times and received error code XXXX. I eventually gave up and contacted Capital One fraud dept. by telephone to notify them that I do not have a credit card acct. Their customer service team attempted to assist and could not understand why this was happening so they escalated/passed the complaint to their internal "" security/IT '' team. They called back and gave me further instructions to attempt login to the "" Credit Wise '' app and those failed as well. They sounded confused over the phone. Ironically, several months after this occurred I started to receive text message alerts that someone was attempting to use my Capital One XXXX card for purchases and they asked me if the purchases were valid via text. I responded "" no '' and did not hear back from them. For the record, I do not have a Capital One XXXX Card nor have been able to login to their "" Credit Wise '' app. I believe they have not done enough to ensure that someone illegally has a credit card in my name or have produced a valid reason why this is happening to me. After reading news about other large banks creating fake credit card and bank accounts recently, I decided to proceed to an FTC complaint since Capital One XXXX and their Credit Wise app security team has failed to assist."
Capital One,My mother lent me a loan in order to pay my Capital One Platinum card & Quicksilver Card. They reversed the payment after my brother questioned the payment. They accused me of fraud & closed both my accounts.
Capital One,"On XXXX/XXXX/16 I received a couple e-mails from Kohl 's stating that my account had been updated and an order placed. I, nor the other card holder had done neither. When I opened the emails, I found that someone had not only changed the name on my account but also the address. Within an hour of these events happening, I called the Kohl 's credit card customer service number provided on the card. After an exhaustive explanation, I was told the cards would be closed, new cards issued, they would try to stop the order and they would investigate. I continued to receive emails that the order was shipped XXXX XXXX/XXXX/16 XXXX, delivered XXXX XXXX/XXXX/16 XXXX, and, no surprise- a refund had been processed XXXX XXXX/XXXX/16 XXXX. I 'm surprised that these events took place even with me notifying them within ONE hour of the changes made on my account. ***How can a name and address be changed on an account and an order immediately placed and no safety measures in place to alert for fraud and protect me as a consumer and themselves as a company? *** As bad as this seems, I received and activated my new cards and on XXXX/XXXX/16 attempted to make a purchase that would not process. I placed a call to customer service and was told that I could not use the cards due to fraudulent activity. I stated that the fraud was on the original cards but that these were new cards. She stated that the new cards were also flagged for fraud and could not be used. I told her that since Kohl 's can NOT protect my information to close the account. I have been a card holder for 10+ years and so I 'm aware that my credit may take a small hit but it will be so worth it versus entrusting my information to this organization. Upon closer inspection with the original and new cards, it appears that the account is the same on all XXXX cards. It appears that Kohl 's simply issued XXXX new cards in the original account with last XXXX numbers being different. SO, I guess the original account was really never closed as I was told would happen. And so again, how did Kohl 's protect my information? And why was the account not closed? As a consolation, I received a letter from Kohl 's dated XXXX/XXXX/16 that states I am not responsible for fraudulent charge. I guess it was just divine intervention that I attempted to use the newly issued card to XXXX that the new cards issued were just extensions to the original account."
Capital One,Capital one is re-billing me for charges that I did not make.
Capital One,"Fall of XXXX, I applied and received XXXX Capital One credit cards. Less than a week after they arrived, I was contacted by Capital One to notify me of an internal breach and that new cards will be issued. The new cards were received and I began to use them for my XXXX businesses. XXXX XXXX, I was contacted by a collection agency asking for payment on a {$5000.00} loan taken out in my name in XXXX XXXX from XXXX. After a lengthy conversation with the collection agency personnel, I was told to go and file a police report and freeze my credit with the XXXX agencies to reduce the chance of this happening again. I went to the police department and filed a report and had my credit access frozen for 7 years. Shortly after, both Captial One credit cards were frozen and phone calls and letters were sent between a Capital One representative regarding this. I was asked to complete a form authorizing their auto-withdrawal of the current balance from my checking account on file, which was completed. When I asked when I would receive new cards, I was told that would occur later. The XXXX statements showed interest payments owed because Capital One did not take the auto payment out when the cards were frozen by Capital One. 1 ) I asked the interest be removed given it was Capital One who stopped the auto pay from the checking account. 2 ) I asked for new cards to be issued when Capital One decided to freeze my use even though I paid them off in full each month and never missed a payment and have over XXXX FICO score. I was told this evening by the Capital One representative that my accounts were set up as payment only and that I would need to re-apply for credit cards. I expressed my disappointment that Capital One and it appears it is doing this to be punitive for identifying Capital One as the point when my identity was stolen last fall XXXX in the police report. Since the Capital One internal breach someone has been trying to open numerous bank accounts throughout the country. It is not my doing that Capital One had customer data compromised by XXXX of its employees as was told to me by the first notification and announced in the business news."
Capital One,Capital one and myself agreed on a payment plan to help my credit card account. Capital One has continuously called me for payment. Even after I had made payment been sent receipts by Capital One. They continue to remove me from my plan and then refuse to speak to me about it.
Capital One,"I was out of work for about 6 months. after contacting the Credit Card Co Cap One, I was hoping to have my fees reduced due to late payments, but I was advised they do not offer this service. So after getting back to work I contacted them again, lets work to reduce the APR from default of 29. % to something manageable till I can catch up. Again sorry we do not offer this. So what are my options I asked? Credit counseling and debt consolidation? Not asking for much just a temporary solution."
Capital One,"Six times since XXXX XXXX, 2016, I have received reports from XXXX that there have been Hard credit inquiries on my credit report that were made without my knowledge or authorization. Each time, I have spent many hours on the telephone with XXXX, Capitol One, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I do not have the energy to fight this any longer. Inquiries that are still on my credit are as follows. 
1. XXXX XXXX, Capitol One Bank USA NA.

There has also been an attempt to open a checking account in my name and with my SSN at XXXX XXXX XXXX a few months back. 
Please help me remove these inquiries from my report with the XXXX credit reporting agencies. None of the XXXX agencies seem to care that these bogus inquiries remain on my report."
Capital One,"My XXXX credit cards issued by capital one was compromised and they replaced all XXXX cards accordingly. However, I am still being made to pay for the fraudulent charges made on the cards all the while they are saying an investigation is taking place there has never been a resolution to the investigation and yet I am still suffering from the overage as well as the restrictions of the card but have not used them. Not to mention its being reported to the XXXX credit agencies. They say I need to still pay and they reimburse but that does not make sense to make me the victim pay for them to reimburse when in fact they have not done anything in regards to this incident. I spoke with several people in the fraud department as well as collections to no avail. Everyone is looking into it but no resolution. Its been under investigation since XXXX and its now XXXX and nothing has changed except new cards with the same fraudulent balance transferred over to new cards. Please help bring resolution to this very awful ordeal."

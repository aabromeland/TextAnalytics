    "### Purpose:\n",
    "- To obtain data from the SEC edgar search and stock market to see the impact of reportings to the SEC on stock valutaion of Deere & Co. Will look to develop a model with Deere and then try to apply it to other companies within the industry and then potentially other companies outside of the Agricultural/Construction and Forestry Industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Background:\n",
    "     - Deere & Company is an Agriculture and Construction and Forestry manufacturer that is headquartered in Moline, Illinois. Deere & Company started in 1837 after John Deere invented the self scouring plow in 1836 that allowed Midwest farmers to plow the thick black dirt of the Midwest without clogging. The company started in the town of Grad Detour, Illinois, and was moved in 1848 to Moline, Illinois. The company started with the technological advancement of the plow that was made from steel instead of cast iron and has since led the industry in technological advances in agriculture all the way to today with the introduction of the first commercially available fully autonomous tractor.  The company was formally incorporated as Deere & Company in 1868. John Deere served as the Founder and president of the company from 1837-1886. Then decedents of Deere served as President and Chairman from 1886-1982 (Charles Deere, William Butterworth, Charles Deere Wiman, William Hewitt). Then from 1982-today, John Deere has been run by members outside of the Deere family (Robert Hanson, Hans Becherer, Robert Lane, Samuel Allen, and John May)\n",

    "- Project Goals\n",
    "    - The project is hoping to identify trends in SEC filings that correlate to positive or negative stock returns. Specifically, we are looking to identify long term trends in the data to determine if SEC filings can help point to long-term growth opportunities in the stock of Deere. Additionally, we would like to extend this analysis beyond Deere to other companies first in the Agricultural and Construction and Forestry industries, and if we get successful results, then extend this to other company filings, as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Research Questions\n",
    "    1.\tWhich standard forms filed with the SEC have the highest sentiment scores?\n",
    "    2.\tWhich standard forms filed with the SEC have the lowest sentiment scores? \n",
    "    3.\tWhich standard forms filed with the SEC have the highest variance in sentiment scores?\n",
    "    4.\tWhich filings coincide with the greatest change in stock price for the company? \n",
    "    5.\tDo SEC filings have a material impact on the stock price of Deere & Co?\n",
    "    6.\tCan the sentiment analysis developed for Deere & Co be applied to other companies within the agricultural and construction industry?\n",
    "    7.\tCan the sentiment analysis developed for Deere & Co be applied to other companies outside of Deere’s industry? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Source\n",
    "    - The dataset is comprised of 1000 filings of Deere with the SEC from October 3rd, 2011 to May, 31st, 2022. Initially, the shortest document in the dataset was 37 characters long with average character lengths of 24,110. However, 38 documents had under 500 characters in them. These were removed because after review of these documents, they were for PDF files that had been loaded or were references to other paper submissions that had been done.  After removing these documents, the average character lengths of the documents were 25,054 with a maximum character length of 564,539 and minimum character length of 539.\n",

document is in two parts. the first part is this prospectus supplement, which describes the terms of the offering of the notes and also adds to and updates the information contained in the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into the accompanying prospectus. the second part is the accompanying prospectus, which gives more general information, some of which may not apply to the notes. to the extent there is a conflict between the information contained in this prospectus supplement, on the one hand, and the information contained in the accompanying prospectus or any document that has previously been filed, on the other hand, the information in this prospectus supplement shall control.         notice to prospective investors in the european economic area and the united kingdom            neither this prospectus supplement nor the accompanying prospectus is a prospectus for the purposes of the prospectus regulation (as defined below). this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus have been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any member state of the european economic area (the \"eea\") or in the united kingdom (each, a \"relevant state\") will only be made to a legal entity which is a qualified investor under the prospectus regulation (\"qualified investor\"). accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that relevant state of notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus may only do so with respect to qualified investors. neither deere nor the underwriters have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of notes other than to qualified investors. the expression \"prospectus regulation\" means regulation (eu) 2017/1129.            prohibition of sales to eea and united kingdom retail investors \\x97the notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the eea or in the united kingdom. for these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of article 4(1) of directive 2014/65/eu, as amended (\"mifid ii\"); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of directive (eu) 2016/97 (the \"insurance distribution directive\"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of article 4(1) of mifid ii; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the prospectus regulation. consequently no key information document required by regulation (eu) no 1286/2014, as amended (the \"priips regulation\") for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the eea or in the united kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the eea or in the united kingdom may be unlawful under the priips regulation.         notice to prospective investors in the united kingdom            the communication of this prospectus supplement, the

spread are affecting our business in a number of ways, which should be considered in connection with an investment in the notes. for further discussion, see our current report on form 8-k filed on march 23, 2020, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, and \"risk factors\\x97risks related to covid-19\\x97the covid-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows\" in this prospectus supplement.   s-5                                                table of contents         risk factors                  in evaluating an investment in the notes, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and the risk factors described under the caption \"risk factors\" in the accompanying prospectus and in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended november 3, 2019, which is incorporated by reference.        risks related to covid-19                the covid-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.            covid-19 was identified in china in late 2019 and has spread globally. the rapid spread has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. even though we believe we are a u.s. federally-designated essential critical business, these measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. we have significant manufacturing operations in the u.s., canada and other countries, and each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it. there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures. future restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our suppliers, and restrictions or disruptions of transportation, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. there is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.           in recent weeks, the covid-19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital. it is likely that the covid-19 pandemic will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. risks related to negative economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled \"negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere\\'s equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs\" under \"risk factors\" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended november 3, 2019.           the ultimate magnitude of covid-19, including the extent of its impact on our financial and operational results, which could be material, will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for our products and services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic. we cannot at this time predict the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.         risks related to the notes                an active trading market may not develop or be maintained for the notes.            each series of notes is a new issue of securities with no established trading market. although the underwriters may make a market for the notes of any series after we complete this offering, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue making a market in any series of notes at any time without notice. we have not listed and do not intend to apply for listing of any series of notes on any securities exchange.           the liquidity of any market for each series of notes that may develop will depend on a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates, our financial condition, liquidity and operating results, the number of holders of the applicable series of notes, the market for similar securities and the interest of   s-6        table of contents  securities dealers in making a market in such notes. we cannot assure you that a trading market for any series of notes will develop or, if developed, that it will continue, or as to the liquidity of any trading market for the notes of any series that may develop or as to the price you may receive should you wish to resell any notes you acquire in this offering.         the notes are subject to early redemption.            as described under \"description of the notes\\x97optional redemption,\" we may at our option redeem the notes of any series any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at the redemption prices described therein. consequently, we may choose to redeem your notes at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the effective interest rate paid on your notes. as a result, we cannot assure you that you will be able to reinvest your redemption proceeds in an investment with a return that is as high as the return you would have earned on your notes if they had not been redeemed and that has a similar level of investment risk.   s-7        table of contents        use of proceeds                  the aggregate net proceeds to us from the sale of the notes will be approximately  moneytoken  after deducting the underwriting discount and our estimated offering expenses. we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes.   s-8        table of contents        description of the notes                  the notes will be senior debt issued under the indenture dated as of september 25, 2008 (the \"indenture\") between us and the bank of new york mellon, as trustee. information about the indenture and the general terms and provisions of the notes is in the accompanying prospectus under \"description of debt securities.\"           each series of the notes will constitute a separate series of debt securities under the indenture. we will initially issue a total of  moneytoken  principal amount of 2025 notes,  moneytoken  principal amount of 2030 notes and  moneytoken  principal amount of 2050 notes.           we may, without giving notice or seeking consent of note holders of any series, issue additional debt securities having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the notes of any series. any such additional debt securities and the applicable series of notes will constitute a single series of debt securities under the indenture, including for the purposes of voting and redemptions; provided that such additional debt securities are fungible with such notes for u.s. federal income tax purposes. no additional debt securities may be issued under the indenture if an event of default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the applicable series of notes.           in the accompanying prospectus, there is a section called \"description of debt securities\\x97provisions applicable to both of the indentures\\x97defeasance\". this section has provisions on the defeasance and covenant defeasance of securities issued under the indenture. these provisions will apply to each series of the notes.           the notes will be issued only in book-entry form in minimum denominations of  moneytoken  and integral multiples of  moneytoken  in excess thereof, with the notes of each series represented by one or more fully registered global notes deposited with the trustee as custodian for, and registered in the name of the nominee of, the depository trust company (\"dtc\"), as depositary. beneficial interests in book-entry notes will be shown on, and transfers of the notes will be made only through, records maintained by dtc and its participants. see \"book-entry, delivery and form\" below and \"description of debt securities\\x97provisions applicable to both of the indentures\\x97global securities\" in the accompanying prospectus.         payment of principal and interest            the 2025 notes will mature on april 15, 2025. the 2030 notes will mature on april 15, 2030. the 2050 notes will mature on april 15, 2050 . however, each series of notes will be subject to optional redemption as described below under \"\\x97optional redemption.\"           the interest rate on the 2025 notes will be 2.750% per annum. the interest rate on the 2030 notes will be 3.100% per annum. the interest rate on the 2050 notes will be 3.750% per annum. we will pay interest in arrears on april 15 and october 15 of each year, beginning october 15, 2020 (long first coupon). interest on the notes will accrue from march 30, 2020 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for until the principal of the notes has been paid or made available for payment. we will pay interest computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.           we will pay interest on the notes on any interest payment date to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the fifteenth day (whether or not a business day) preceding that particular interest payment date. at maturity, we will pay the principal of the notes upon delivery of the notes to the trustee.           if an interest payment date or the scheduled maturity date or any date of earlier redemption for the notes is not a \"business day,\" we will pay interest, premium, if any, and/or principal, as the case may be, on the next succeeding business day, but will not pay additional interest. the term \"business   s-9        table of contents  day\" means any day other than a saturday or sunday or a day on which applicable law or regulation authorizes or requires banking institutions in the city of new york to close.          optional redemption            we may redeem the notes of any series at our option at any time, in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price (the \"redemption price\") equal to the sum of:    \\x95 the principal amount of the notes of the applicable series being redeemed plus accrued interest on such notes to the redemption date; and   \\x95 the make-whole amount, as defined below, if any, with respect to such notes.            if the notes of any series are redeemed on or after the applicable par call date (as defined below), the redemption price will not include the make-whole amount.           notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the notes that are due and payable on an interest payment date falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on such interest payment date to the holders thereof as of the close of business on the relevant record date.           if we have given notice of redemption and have made funds available on the redemption date referred to in the notice for the redemption, the notes of the applicable series called for redemption will cease to bear interest on the redemption date and the holders of those notes from and after the redemption date will be entitled to receive only the payment of the redemption price upon surrender of those notes in accordance with the notice.           we will give notice of any optional redemption of the notes of the applicable series to holders of those notes, at their addresses, as shown in the security register for the notes, not more than 45 nor less than 15 days prior to the redemption date. the notice of redemption will specify, among other items, the redemption price and the principal amount of the notes held by the holder to be redeemed.           if we choose to redeem less than all of the notes of any series, we will notify the trustee at least five business days prior to giving notice of redemption, or a shorter period as may be satisfactory to the trustee, of the aggregate principal amount of such notes to be redeemed and their redemption date. the trustee will select, on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable or by lot or by such other manner it deems fair and appropriate (and in such manner that complies with the requirements of the depositary, if applicable), such notes to be redeemed in part.           as used in this prospectus supplement:           \"applicable par call date\" means (i) march 15, 2025, for any 2025 notes (the date that is one month prior to the maturity of the 2025 notes), (ii) january 15, 2030 for any 2030 notes (the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the 2030 notes) and (iii) october 15, 2049 for any 2050 notes (the date that is six months prior to the maturity of the 2050 notes).           \"make-whole amount\" means in connection with any optional redemption of the notes, the excess, if any, of:    \\x95 the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of each dollar of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest, calculated by us, excluding interest accrued to the date of redemption, that would have been payable in respect of each dollar assuming the notes being redeemed matured on, and that accrued and unpaid interest on such notes was payable on, the applicable par call date (determined by discounting, on a semiannual basis, the principal and interest at the reinvestment rate, determined on the third business day preceding the date notice of the redemption is given, from the respective dates on which the principal and interest would have been payable assuming the notes being redeemed matured on, and that accrued and unpaid interest on such notes was payable on, the applicable par call date), over   s-10        table of contents    \\x95 the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed.            \"reinvestment rate\" means the yield on treasury securities at a constant maturity corresponding to the remaining life to maturity (rounded up to the nearest month) of the principal of the notes being redeemed as of the date of redemption (which maturity shall be deemed to be the applicable par call date) (the \"treasury yield\"), plus 0.350% in the case of the 2025 notes being redeemed, 0.350% in the case of the 2030 notes being redeemed and 0.350% in the case of the 2050 notes being redeemed. for purposes of calculating the reinvestment rate, (1) the treasury yield will be equal to the arithmetic mean of the yields displayed for each day in the preceding calendar week published in the statistical release for treasury constant maturities with a maturity equal to the remaining life to maturity of the notes being redeemed (assuming the notes matured on the applicable par call date) and (2) the most recent statistical release published prior to the date of the applicable determination will be used. however, if no published maturity exactly corresponds to such remaining life, then the treasury yield will be interpolated or extrapolated on a straight-line basis from the arithmetic means of the yields for the next shortest and next longest published maturities. if the format or content of the statistical release changes in a manner that precludes determination of the treasury yield in the above manner, then the treasury yield will be determined in the manner that most closely approximates the above manner, as we reasonably determine.            \"statistical release\" means the statistical release designated \"h.15\" or any successor publication that is published weekly by the federal reserve system and that reports yields on actively traded united states government securities adjusted to constant maturities, or, if that statistical release or successor publication is not published at the time of any required determination under the indenture, then another reasonably comparable index which we will designate.         ranking            the notes will be unsecured and will rank equally and pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.         certain covenants            certain covenants in the indenture limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to create or permit to exist certain mortgages and other liens, and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. for a description of these covenants, please see \"description of debt securities\\x97limitation on liens\" and \"description of debt securities\\x97limitation on sale and lease-back transactions.\"         governing law            the indenture and the notes are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york, without regard to conflicts of laws principles of such state other than new york general obligations law section 5-1401.         book-entry, delivery and form            the notes will be issued in book-entry form only. in order to own a beneficial interest in a note, you must be an institution that has an account with dtc or have an account with an institution, such as a brokerage firm, that has an account with dtc. this means that we will not issue actual notes or certificates to each beneficial owner. instead, we will issue one or more global securities representing notes and such global security or securities will be held by or on behalf of dtc or its nominee. the beneficial ownership interest of each actual purchaser of notes in book-entry form represented by a global note will be recorded on the records of direct participants and indirect participants, including the records of clearstream banking, s.a. and euroclear bank sa/nv. for a more complete description   s-11        table of contents  of book-entry debt securities, see \"description of debt securities\\x97provisions applicable to both of the indentures\\x97global securities\" in the accompanying prospectus.           payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the notes represented by a global

  material united states federal income tax considerations                  the following is a summary of the material united states federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax considerations. this summary is based on the provisions of the united states internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the \"code\"), the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the united states internal revenue service (\"irs\") and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this document, and all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. we have not sought any ruling from the irs with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the irs in the event of litigation.           this summary deals only with beneficial owners of the notes that purchase the notes in this offering at the applicable initial offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus supplement and that will hold the notes as \"capital assets\" within the meaning of section 1221 of the code (generally, property held for investment). this summary does not purport to deal with all aspects of united states federal income taxation that might be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment circumstances or status, nor does it address tax considerations applicable to investors that may be subject to special tax rules, such as certain financial institutions, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, s corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements for united states federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies, \"expatriated entities\" subject to section 7874 of the code, certain former citizens or residents of the united states subject to section 877 of the code, taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement, and persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax. this summary also does not discuss the notes held as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction, or situations in which the \"functional currency\" of a united states holder (as defined below) is not the united states dollar. moreover, the effects of any applicable united states federal estate or gift, state, local or non-united states tax laws and any tax arising under section 1411 of the code (the \"medicare\" tax on certain investment income) are not discussed.           in the case of a beneficial owner of the notes that is classified as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes, the tax treatment of the notes to a partner of the partnership generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. if you are a partner of a partnership holding the notes, then you should consult your own tax advisors.           the following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. investors considering the purchase of the notes should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the application of the united states federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the united states federal estate or gift tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-united states taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.           the discussion below assumes that any original issue discount (\"oid\") on the notes (that is, any excess of the principal amount of the notes over their issue price), is either zero or de minimis (less than 1/4% of their principal amount multiplied by the maturity of the notes), all within the meaning of the oid treasury regulations. if these conditions are not satisfied with respect to the notes and as a result the notes are treated as having been issued with oid, a holder would be required to include oid in income as interest over the term of the note under a constant yield method. even if a note   s-13        table of contents  has only de minimis oid, the holder must include such oid in income proportionately as principal payments are made on such note.         effect of certain contingencies            in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay amounts on the notes in addition to or at different times than the scheduled payments of stated principal and interest (e.g., in the circumstances described under \"description of the notes\\x97optional redemption\"). these potential payments may implicate the provisions of the treasury regulations relating to \"contingent payment debt instruments.\" one or more contingencies will not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments if, as of the issue date of the notes, such contingencies, in the aggregate, are considered remote or incidental. although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of payment of such additional amounts does not result in any series of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable treasury regulations. this position is based on our determination that, as of the issue date of the notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations.           our determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses to the irs on its tax return for the taxable year during which it acquires the notes that it is taking a different position. however, our position is not binding on the irs. if the irs takes a contrary position to that described above, then the notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. in that case, regardless of a holder\\'s regular method of accounting for united states federal income tax purposes, a holder subject to united states federal income taxation may be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate, and to treat any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than capital gain. holders of the notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. the remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for united states federal income tax purposes.         united states holders            the term \"united states holder\" means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for united states federal income tax purposes:    \\x95 an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the united states;  \\x95 a corporation created or organized under the laws of the united states, any state thereof or the district of columbia;   \\x95 an estate, the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source; or   \\x95 a trust, if (i) a court within the united states is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more united states persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (ii) in the case of a trust that was treated as a domestic trust under the law in effect before 1997, a valid election is in place under applicable treasury regulations to treat such trust as a domestic trust.          payment of stated interest            stated interest on a note generally will be included in the gross income of a united states holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the holder\\'s method of accounting for united states federal income tax purposes.  s-14        table of contents        sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes            upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, a united states holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized upon the disposition and (ii) the holder\\'s adjusted tax basis in the note. the amount realized will be equal to the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the note (less any portion allocable to any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxed as ordinary interest income to the extent not previously so taxed). a united states holder\\'s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal the cost of the note to such holder. this gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the united states holder has held the note for more than one year. in general, long-term capital gains of a non-corporate united states holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. united states holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances.         information reporting and backup withholding tax            in general, we must report certain information to the irs with respect to payments to certain non-corporate united states holders of principal, premium, if any, and interest on a note, and payments of the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of a note to certain united states holders. the payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding tax, currently at a rate of 24 percent, if (i) the payee fails to furnish a correct taxpayer identification number (\"tin\") to the payor or to establish an exemption from backup withholding tax, (ii) the irs notifies the payor that the tin furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii) there has been a notified payee underreporting described in section 3406(c) of the code or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct tin and that the irs has not notified the payee that it is subject to backup withholding tax under the code. united states backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. any amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules from a payment to a united states holder will be allowed as a credit against the holder\\'s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the irs.         non-united states holders            the term \"non-united states holder\" means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for united states federal income tax purposes:    \\x95 a nonresident alien individual;  \\x95 a foreign corporation; or  \\x95 a foreign estate or trust.            the following discussion applies only to non-united states holders, and assumes that no item of income, gain, deduction or loss derived by the non-united states holder in respect of the notes at any time is effectively connected with the conduct of a united states trade or business. special rules, not discussed herein, may apply to certain non-united states holders, such as:    \\x95 certain former citizens or residents of the united states;  \\x95 controlled foreign corporations;  \\x95 passive foreign investment companies;  \\x95 corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid united states federal income tax;  \\x95 investors in pass-through entities that are subject to special treatment under the code; and   s-15        table of contents    \\x95 non-united states holders that are engaged in the conduct of a united states trade or business.          payment of interest            subject to the discussions on backup withholding tax and fatca below, interest paid on a note by us or any paying agent to a non-united states holder will be exempt from united states income and withholding tax under the \"portfolio interest exemption\" provided that (i) the non-united states holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10 percent or more of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote, (ii) the non-united states holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us, actually or constructively, through stock ownership, (iii) the non-united states holder is not a bank that acquired the notes in consideration for an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business and (iv) either (a) the non-united states holder provides to us or our paying agent a properly completed applicable irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e (or other applicable form), signed under penalties of perjury, that includes its name and address and that certifies its non-united states status in compliance with applicable law and regulations, or (b) a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers\\' securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business on behalf of the non-united states holder provides a statement to us or our agent under penalties of perjury in which it certifies that a properly completed applicable irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e (or other applicable form) has been received by it from the non-united states holder or a qualifying intermediary and furnishes a copy to us or our agent. this certification requirement may be satisfied with other documentary evidence in the case of a note held in an offshore account or through certain foreign intermediaries.           if a non-united states holder cannot satisfy the requirements of the portfolio interest exemption described above, payments of interest made to such holder generally will be subject to united states withholding tax at the rate of 30 percent, unless the holder provides us or our agent with a properly executed irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e (or other applicable form) establishing an exemption from or reduction of the withholding tax under the benefit of an applicable tax treaty.         sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the notes            subject to the discussions on backup withholding tax below, a non-united states holder generally will not be subject to united states federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of a note (other than any amount representing accrued but unpaid interest on the note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under \"non-united states holders\\x97payment of interest\") unless the non-united states holder is an individual who was present in the united states for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met. if a non-united states holder is an individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of a note, and certain other requirements are met, then such non-united states holder generally will be subject to united states federal income tax at a flat rate of 30 percent (unless a lower applicable treaty rate applies) on any such realized gain, which may be offset by certain united states-source capital losses.         information reporting and backup withholding tax            the amount of interest paid to a non-united states holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from such payment generally must be reported annually to the non-united states holder and to the irs. the irs may make this information available under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-united states holder is resident.   s-16        table of contents          provided that a non-united states holder has complied with certain reporting procedures (usually satisfied by providing a properly completed irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e) or otherwise establishes an exemption, the non-united states holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding tax with respect to interest payments on, and the proceeds from the disposition of, a note, unless we or our paying agent know or have reason to know that the holder is a united states person. additional rules relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding tax with respect to the payment of proceeds from the disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a note are as follows:    \\x95 if the proceeds are paid to or through the united states office of a broker, a non-united states holder generally will be subject to backup withholding tax and information reporting unless the non-united states holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a united states person (usually on an irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e) or otherwise establishes an exemption.  \\x95 if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-united states office of a broker that is not a united states person and does not have certain specified united states connections (a \"united states related person\"), a non-united states holder will not be subject to backup withholding tax or information reporting.   \\x95 if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-united states office of a broker that is a united states person or a united states related person, a non-united states holder generally will be subject to information reporting (but generally not backup withholding tax) unless the non-united states holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a united states person (usually on an irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e) or otherwise establishes an exemption.            united states backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. any amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the non-united states holder\\'s united states federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the irs.          fatca            under fatca, certain foreign financial institutions (each an \"ffi\"), as that term (or its equivalent) is defined under an intergovernmental agreement between the united states and a foreign jurisdiction (an \"iga\") or, in the absence of an iga, under fatca generally, including entities such as foreign hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, securitization vehicles and other investment vehicles (regardless of their size), must comply with due diligence, withholding and reporting rules with respect to their owners, account holders and investors or else bear a 30% withholding tax on certain u.s. source payments made to them. regardless of whether an ffi is acting as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary with respect to the withholdable payment, the fatca withholding tax generally will be imposed on withholdable payments, subject to certain exceptions, unless the ffi (i) has entered into (or is otherwise subject to) and is complying with an agreement with the internal revenue service (an \"ffi agreement\") or (ii) is required by and is in compliance with applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an iga, in either case to, among other things, collect and provide to the united states or other relevant tax authorities certain information regarding united states account holders of such institution. in the case of u.s. source payments made to a foreign entity that is not an ffi, the fatca withholding tax generally will be imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification that it does not have any \"substantial\" united states owners, identifies its \"substantial\" united states owners or is otherwise exempt from fatca. in certain cases, a \"substantial\" united states owner can mean an owner of any interest in the foreign entity. for these purposes, \"fatca\" means section 1471 through 1474 of the code and any regulations or official interpretations thereof (including any revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice or similar guidance issued by the u.s. internal revenue service thereunder as a precondition to relief or exemption from   s-17        table of contents  taxes under such sections, regulations and interpretations), any ffi agreements, any igas entered into in connection with any of the foregoing and any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or generally accepted practices adopted pursuant to any such iga, and any amendments made to any of the foregoing after the date hereof.           generally, if a foreign entity subject to fatca does not comply with applicable fatca diligence and reporting requirements or otherwise provide the withholding agent with the proper certification, \"withholdable payments\" made to such foreign entity will be subject to a 30% withholding tax. for this purpose, withholdable payments are generally u.s.-source payments, such as interest payments on the notes. under proposed regulations, fatca withholding tax on the gross proceeds from the sale of certain equity or debt instruments (including the notes) of u.s. issuers, scheduled to take effect beginning january 1, 2019, has been repealed. in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the internal revenue service provided that taxpayers may rely upon this repeal until the issuance of final regulations. subject to the foregoing, fatca withholding tax will apply regardless of whether the payment would otherwise be exempt from u.s. nonresident withholding tax (e.g., under the portfolio interest exemption or as capital gain).            holders of the notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of fatca to their investment in the notes.   s-18

securities with no established trading market. one or more of the underwriters may make a secondary market for the notes of any series. however, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue making a secondary market for the notes of any series at any time without notice. no assurance can be given as to the development, maintenance or liquidity of any trading market for the notes of any series.           the representatives, on behalf of the underwriters, may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with regulation m under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended.     \\x95 over-allotment involves sales by the underwriters of the notes of any series in excess of the principal amount of such notes referred to on the cover page of this prospectus supplement, which creates a syndicate short position.  \\x95 stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the notes of any series so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specific maximum.   \\x95 syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes of any series in the open market after the distribution of those notes has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. a short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of such notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering.  \\x95 penalty bids permit the representatives to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when notes originally sold by such syndicate member are purchased in a stabilizing transaction or a syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions.            these stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. as a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. these transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.         delayed settlement            we expect that the delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date specified on the cover page of this prospectus supplement, which will be the third business day following the date of this prospectus supplement. under rules of the securities and exchange commission, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to that trade expressly agree otherwise. accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes before the second business day prior to the closing date specified on the cover page of this prospectus supplement will be required, by virtue of the fact that the normal settlement date for that trade would occur prior to the closing date for the issuance of the notes, to specify an alternate   s-20        table of contents  settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement, and should consult their own advisors with respect to these matters.         other relationships            the underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to us and our affiliates and to persons and entities with relationships with us and our affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.           in the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments, including serving as counterparties to certain derivative and hedging arrangements, and may actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to our assets, securities and/or instruments (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or those of our affiliates and/or persons and entities with relationships with us and our affiliates. the underwriters and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments. certain of the underwriters or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. typically, such underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby.         selling restrictions          european economic area and the united kingdom

risks, especially if the securities involve in some way a foreign currency. this prospectus does not describe all of the risks of an investment in the securities, whether arising because the securities are payable in a currency other than u.s. dollars or because the return on the securities is linked to one or more interest rates or currency indices or formulas. you should consult your own financial and legal advisors about the risks entailed by an investment in the securities and the suitability of your investment in the securities in light of your particular circumstances. foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities are not an appropriate investment for investors who are unsophisticated with respect to foreign currency transactions or transactions involving the type of index or formula used to determine amounts payable. non-u.s. residents should consult their own legal and financial advisors with regard to these matters. you should also consider carefully the matters described below, as well as the other factors described in deere & company\\'s safe harbor statements and under \"risk factors\" included or incorporated by reference in its most recent annual report on form 10-k and subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q filed with the securities and exchange commission (the \"sec\"). in this prospectus, unless the context otherwise requires, we will use the terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ourselves\" and \"us\" to mean each of deere & company and john deere funding s.a., as applicable, as issuers of the securities described herein.         exchange rates and exchange controls may adversely affect your foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities            if you invest in foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities, there will be significant risks not associated with investments in debt instruments denominated in u.s. dollars or u.s. dollar based indices. these risks include the possibility of significant changes in the rate of exchange between the u.s. dollar and your payment or indexed currency and the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls by either the united states or the applicable foreign governments. we have no control over the factors that generally affect these risks, such as economic, financial and political events and the supply and demand for the applicable currencies. in recent years, rates of exchange between the u.s. dollar and certain foreign currencies have been volatile and this volatility may continue in the future. past fluctuations in any particular exchange rate are not necessarily indicative, however, of fluctuations that may occur in the future. fluctuations in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar could result in a decrease in the u.s. dollar-equivalent yield of your foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities, in the u.s. dollar-equivalent value of the principal or any premium payable at maturity of your securities and, generally, in the u.s. dollar-equivalent market value of your securities. the currency risks with respect to your foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities may be further described in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet.           foreign exchange rates can either float or be fixed by sovereign governments. governments, however, often do not voluntarily allow their currencies to float freely in response to economic forces. instead, governments use a variety of techniques, such as intervention by that country\\'s central bank, or the imposition of regulatory controls or taxes, to affect the exchange rate of their currencies. governments may also issue a new currency to replace an existing currency or alter the exchange rate or relative exchange characteristics by the devaluation or revaluation of a currency. thus, an important risk in purchasing foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities for u.s. dollar based investors is that their u.s. dollar-equivalent yields could be affected by governmental actions that could change or interfere with currency valuation that was previously freely determined, fluctuations in response to other market forces and the movement of currencies across borders. there will be no adjustment or change in the terms of the foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities if exchange rates become fixed, or if any devaluation or revaluation or imposition of exchange or other   1        table of contents  regulatory controls or taxes occur, or other developments affecting the u.s. dollar or any applicable currency occur.           the paying agent will make all calculations relating to your foreign currency securities or currency indexed securities. all of these determinations will, in the absence of clear error, be binding on holders of the securities.           any prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to securities with an applicable currency other than u.s. dollars will contain information concerning historical exchange rates for that currency against the u.s. dollar and a brief description of any relevant exchange controls.         there may be risks associated with foreign currency judgments            the indentures and the securities referred to in this prospectus will be, except to the extent described in a prospectus supplement or term sheet, governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of new york. an action based upon an obligation payable in a currency other than u.s. dollars may be brought in courts in the united states. however, courts in the united states have not customarily rendered judgments for money damages denominated in any currency other than u.s. dollars. in addition, it is not clear whether, in granting a judgment, the rate of conversion would be determined with reference to the date of default, the date judgment is rendered or any other date. the judiciary law of the state of new york provides, however, that an action based upon an obligation payable in a currency other than u.s. dollars will be rendered in the foreign currency of the underlying obligation and converted into u.s. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on the date the judgment or decree is entered. in these cases, holders of foreign currency securities would bear the risk of exchange rate fluctuations between the time the amount of judgment is calculated and the time the foreign currency was converted into u.s. dollars and paid to the holders.           you should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks entailed by an investment in foreign currency securities. these securities are not an appropriate investment for investors who are unsophisticated with respect to foreign currency transactions.         securities indexed to interest rate, currency or other indices or formulas may have risks not associated with a conventional debt security            if you invest in securities indexed to one or more interest rates, currencies or other indices or formulas, you will be subject to significant risks not associated with a conventional fixed rate or floating rate debt security. these risks include fluctuation of the particular indices or formulas and the possibility that you will receive a lower, or no, amount of principal, premium or interest and at different times than you expected. we have no control over a number of matters, including economic, financial and political events, that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of these risks and their results. in addition, if an index or formula used to determine any amounts payable in respect of the securities contains a multiplier or leverage factor, the effect of any change in the particular index or formula will be magnified. in recent years, values of certain indices and formulas have been volatile and volatility in those and other indices and formulas may be expected in the future. however, past experience is not necessarily indicative of what may occur in the future.         credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in the securities            the credit ratings on the debt securities may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure and other factors on the value of those securities.           in addition, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the debt securities. our credit ratings are an assessment of our ability to pay our obligations. actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the debt securities.   2        table of contents   our credit ratings, however, may not reflect the effects on the market value of the debt securities of the risks discussed above relating to market and other factors and whether a trading market for your debt securities will ever develop, or if one develops, be maintained or be liquid.           for additional information about deere & company\\'s credit ratings, see deere & company\\'s most recent annual report on form 10-k and subsequent quarterly and current reports on form 10-q and 8-k, respectively, filed with the sec.         reform of libor, euribor and other \"benchmarks\" may adversely impact the debt securities.            the london interbank offered rate (\"libor\"), the euro interbank offered rate (\"euribor\"), and other rates or indices which are deemed to be \"benchmarks\" are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. some of these reforms are already effective, while others are still to be implemented. these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or to have other consequences which cannot be predicted. any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any debt securities linked to such a \"benchmark,\" and could, among other things, reduce the payments on those debt securities.         enforcement of liabilities with respect to john deere funding s.a.            john deere funding s.a. is a subsidiary of deere & company incorporated under the laws of the grand duchy of luxembourg. one or more directors of john deere funding s.a. reside outside the united states. all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons, as well as john deere funding s.a., are located outside the united states. john deere funding s.a. does not conduct business in the united states, and it is the position of john deere funding s.a. that (except as provided below) it is not subject to service of process in the united states. as a result, it may not be possible for investors in the guaranteed debt securities to effect service of process within the united states upon such persons or to enforce against such persons or john deere funding s.a. judgments obtained in u.s. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states. john deere funding s.a. has, however, consented to service of process in the united states with respect to any action that may be brought in connection with the guaranteed debt securities or the guaranteed debt indenture. john deere funding s.a. has been advised by luxembourg counsel that there is no treaty regarding the recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions between the united states and luxembourg. as a result, a final judgment obtained in the courts of new york against john deere funding s.a. or deere & company will be recognized and enforced by the courts of luxembourg in accordance with general provisions of luxembourg procedural law for the enforcement of foreign judgments originating from countries which are not bound by the ec regulation 44/2001 or which are not signatories to the brussels or the lugano convention. pursuant to such rules, an enforceable judgment rendered by any new york court based on contract would not be directly enforceable in luxembourg. however, a party who obtains a judgment in a new york court may initiate enforcement proceedings in luxembourg (\"exequatur\"), by requesting enforcement of the new york judgment from the district court (\"tribunal d\\'arrondissement\"), pursuant to section 678 of the new luxembourg code of civil procedure. the district court will authorize the enforcement in luxembourg of the new york judgment, without re-examination of the merits, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.         where you can find more information                  deere & company files annual, quarterly and current reports and other information with the sec. all references to

of warrants or conversion or exchange of other offered securities, will be referred to as the \"securities.\"           we may also add to and offer additional securities, including securities to be sold by selling security holders, by filing a prospectus supplement or term sheet with the sec at the time of the offer.           you should rely only on the information contained in or incorporated by reference in this prospectus or any prospectus supplement or term sheet. we have not authorized any other person to provide you with different or additional information. if anyone provides you with different or additional information, you should not rely on it. we are not making an offer to sell these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. you should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus, any prospectus supplement or term sheet, or any documents incorporated by reference, is accurate only as of the date on the front cover of the applicable document. our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects may have changed since then.         prospectus supplement or term sheet                  this prospectus provides you with a general description of the securities that we may offer. each time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement or term sheet that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering. the prospectus supplement or term sheet may also add to, update or change information contained in this prospectus, and accordingly, to the extent inconsistent, information in this prospectus is superseded by the information in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. you should read both this prospectus and any prospectus supplement or term sheet together with the additional information described under the heading \"where you can find more information.\"            the prospectus supplement or term sheet to be attached to the front of this prospectus will describe: the terms of the securities offered, any initial public offering price, the price paid to us for the securities, the net proceeds to us, the manner of distribution and any underwriting compensation and the other specific material terms related to the offering of these securities.           for more detail on the terms of the securities, you should read the exhibits filed with or incorporated by reference in our registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.   6        table of contents        description of debt securities                  we may issue debt securities in one or more distinct series. this section summarizes the material terms of the debt securities that are common to all series. most of the financial terms and other specific material terms of any series of debt securities that we offer will be described in a prospectus supplement or term sheet to be attached to the front of this prospectus. furthermore, since the terms of specific debt securities may differ from the general information we have provided below, you should rely on information in the prospectus supplement or term sheet that contradicts different information below.           as required by federal law for all bonds and notes of companies that are publicly offered, the debt securities are governed by a document called an \"indenture.\" an indenture is a contract between us and a financial institution acting as trustee on your behalf. the trustee has two main roles. first, the trustee can enforce your rights against us if we default. there are some limitations on the extent to which the trustee acts on your behalf, described in the second paragraph under \"events of default\\x97remedies if an event of default occurs.\" second, the trustee performs certain administrative duties for us.           senior and subordinated securities will be issued by deere & company under an indenture dated as of september 25, 2008, as supplemented from time to time (the \"deere indenture\"), between deere & company and the bank of new york mellon, trustee (the \"trustee\"). guaranteed debt securities will be issued by john deere funding s.a. under an indenture, dated as of september 25, 2008, as supplemented from time to time (the \"guaranteed debt indenture\"), among john deere funding s.a., deere & company, as guarantor, and the bank of new york mellon, trustee (the \"guaranteed debt trustee\").           the term \"trustee\" refers to the trustee or the guaranteed debt trustee, as appropriate. we will refer to the deere indenture and the guaranteed debt indenture together as the \"indentures.\" the indentures are subject to and governed by the trust indenture act of 1939, as amended (the \"tia\").           because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the debt securities and the indentures. we urge you to read the indenture that governs your debt securities because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of debt securities. for example, in this section, we use capitalized words to signify terms that are specifically defined in the indentures. some of the definitions are repeated in this prospectus, but for the rest you will need to read the indentures. the form of each indenture is filed as an exhibit to this registration statement.         general            each series of debt securities will be unsecured obligations of deere & company or john deere funding s.a., as applicable. the senior securities and the guaranteed debt securities will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of deere & company or john deere funding s.a., as applicable. the subordinated securities will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the senior indebtedness of deere & company as described under \"\\x97provisions applicable to the deere indenture\\x97subordination.\"           each indenture provides that any debt securities proposed to be sold under this prospectus and the attached prospectus supplement or term sheet (\"offered debt securities\") and any debt securities issuable upon the exercise of debt warrants or upon conversion or exchange of other offered securities (\"underlying debt securities\"), as well as other unsecured debt securities, may be issued under that indenture in one or more series.   7        table of contents          you should read the prospectus supplement or term sheet for the material terms of the offered debt securities and any underlying debt securities, including the following:    \\x95 the title of the debt securities and whether the debt securities will be senior securities or subordinated securities of deere & company or guaranteed debt securities of john deere funding s.a.  \\x95 the total principal amount of the debt securities and any limit on the total principal amount of debt securities of the series.   \\x95 if not the principal amount of the debt securities, the portion of the principal amount payable upon acceleration of the maturity of the debt securities or how this portion will be determined.  \\x95 the date or dates, or how the date or dates will be determined or extended, when the principal of the debt securities will be payable.   \\x95 the interest rate or rates, which may be fixed or variable, that the debt securities will bear, if any, or how the rate or rates will be determined, the date or dates from which any interest will accrue or how the date or dates will be determined, the interest payment dates, any record dates for these payments and the basis upon which interest will be calculated if other than that of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  \\x95 any optional redemption provisions.  \\x95 any sinking fund or other provisions that would obligate us to repurchase or otherwise redeem the debt securities.   \\x95 the form in which we will issue the debt securities, if other than in registered book-entry only form represented by global securities; whether we will have the option of issuing debt securities in \"certificated\" form; whether there is the option of issuing certificated debt securities in bearer form if we issue the securities outside the united states to non-u.s. persons; any restrictions on the offer, sale or delivery of bearer securities and the terms, if any, upon which bearer securities of the series may be exchanged for registered securities of the series and vice versa (if permitted by applicable laws and regulations).  \\x95 if other than u.s. dollars, the currency or currencies in which the debt securities are denominated and/or payable.   \\x95 whether the amount of payments of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the debt securities will be

 \\x95 the place or places, if any, other than or in addition to the city of new york, of payment, transfer, conversion and/or exchange of the debt securities.  \\x95 if other than denominations of u.s. moneytoken  or any integral multiple in the case of registered securities issued in certificated form and u.s. moneytoken  in the case of non-registered securities issued in bearer form, the denominations in which the offered debt securities will be issued.  \\x95 the applicability of the provisions of the applicable indenture described under \"defeasance\" and any provisions in modification of, in addition to or in lieu of any of these provisions.  \\x95 whether and under what circumstances we will pay additional amounts, as contemplated by the applicable indenture, in respect of any tax, assessment or governmental charge and, if so, whether we will have the option to redeem the debt securities rather than pay the additional amounts (and the terms of this option).   8                                                 table of contents     \\x95 any provisions granting special rights to the holders of the debt securities upon the occurrence of specified events.   \\x95 any changes or additions to the events of default or covenants contained in the applicable indenture.   \\x95 whether the debt securities will be convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities and the applicable terms and conditions.   \\x95 any other material terms of the debt securities.            for purposes of this prospectus, any reference to the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on debt securities will include additional amounts if required by the terms of the debt securities.           neither indenture limits the amount of debt securities that may be issued thereunder from time to time. debt securities issued under each of the deere indenture or the guaranteed debt indenture, when a single trustee is acting for all debt securities issued under each of the deere indenture or the guaranteed debt indenture, are called the \"indenture securities.\" each indenture also provides that there may be more than one trustee thereunder, each with respect to one or more different series of indenture securities. see \"\\x97resignation of trustee\" below. at a time when two or more trustees are acting under either indenture, each with respect to only certain series, the term \"indenture securities\" means the one or more series of debt securities with respect to which each respective trustee is acting. in the event that there is more than one trustee under either indenture, the powers and trust obligations of each trustee described in this prospectus will extend only to the one or more series of indenture securities for which it is trustee. if two or more trustees are acting under either indenture, then the indenture securities for which each trustee is acting would be treated as if issued under separate indentures.           the indentures do not contain any provisions that give you protection in the event we issue a large amount of debt or we are acquired by another entity.           we refer you to the prospectus supplement or term sheet for information with respect to any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the events of default or our covenants that are described below, including any addition of a covenant or other provision providing event risk or similar protection.           we have the ability to issue indenture securities with terms different from those of indenture securities previously issued and, without the consent of the holders thereof, to reopen a previous issue of a series of indenture securities and issue additional indenture securities of that series unless the reopening was restricted when that series was created.            unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, the debt securities will be denominated in u.s. dollars and all payments on the debt securities will be made in u.s. dollars. for further information regarding foreign currency notes (as defined below), see \"risk factors\" and \"special provisions relating to foreign currency notes.\"           payment of the purchase price of the debt securities must be made in immediately available funds.           as used in this prospectus, \"business day\" means any day, other than a saturday or sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the city of new york; provided, however, that, with respect to foreign currency notes, the day is also not a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the principal financial center (as defined below) of the country issuing the specified currency; and provided further that, with respect to debt securities as to which libor is an applicable interest rate basis, the day is also a london business   9        table of contents  day. for debt securities denominated in euro, the term business day means any day that is not a saturday or sunday, and is also a day on which the trans-european automated real time gross settlement express transfer system (\"target\") is operating, which we will refer to as a \"target business day.\"           \"foreign currency notes\" means debt securities denominated or payable in a specified currency other than u.s. dollars.           \"london business day\" means a day on which commercial banks are open for business (including dealings in the designated libor currency) in london.            \"principal financial center\" means (i) the capital city of the country issuing the specified currency or (ii) the capital city of the country to which the designated libor currency relates, as applicable, except that the term \"principal financial center\" means the following cities in the case of the following currencies:                   currency        principal financial center    u.s. dollars   the city of new york   australian dollars   sydney   canadian dollars   toronto   new zealand dollars   auckland   south african rand   johannesburg   swiss francs   zurich       and in the event the libor currency is euro, the \"principal financial center\" is london.           the authorized denominations of debt securities denominated in u.s. dollars will be integral multiples of u.s. moneytoken  the authorized denominations of foreign currency notes will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet.         provisions applicable to the deere indenture            if the debt securities to be offered are subordinated, unless otherwise or more fully described in the related prospectus supplement or term sheet, the following provisions will apply.         subordination            upon any distribution of deere & company\\'s assets upon any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or receivership proceedings or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of deere & company or otherwise, the holders of all senior indebtedness are be entitled to receive payment in full of the principal thereof (and premium, if any) and interest due thereon before the holders of the subordinated securities are entitled to receive any payment upon the principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on indebtedness evidenced by the subordinated securities, but deere & company\\'s obligation to make payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the subordinated securities will not otherwise be affected. in addition, no payment on account of principal of, premium, if any, sinking fund or interest may be made on the subordinated securities at any time unless full payment of all amounts due in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, sinking fund and interest on senior indebtedness has been made or duly provided for in money or money\\'s worth.           in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by deere & company is received by the trustee or the holders of any of the subordinated securities before all senior indebtedness is paid in full, any payment or distribution of assets of deere & company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the holders of the subordinated securities or the trustee would be   10         table of contents  entitled shall be paid by the liquidating trustee or agent or other person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, must be paid over directly to the holders of the senior indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such the senior indebtedness the senior indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all senior indebtedness remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of such senior indebtedness. subject to the payment in full of all senior indebtedness upon this distribution by deere & company, the holders of the subordinated securities will be subrogated to the rights of the holders of the senior indebtedness to the extent of payments made to the holders of the senior indebtedness out of the distributive share of the subordinated securities.           by reason of this subordination, in the event of a distribution of deere & company\\'s assets upon its insolvency, certain of deere & company\\'s general creditors may recover more, ratably, than holders of the subordinated securities. the deere indenture provides that these subordination provisions will not apply to money and securities held in trust under the defeasance provisions of the deere indenture.           senior indebtedness is defined in the deere indenture as the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on:    \\x95 deere & company\\'s indebtedness (including indebtedness of others guaranteed by deere & company), whenever created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed, for money borrowed other than the subordinated securities issued under the deere indenture, unless in the instrument creating or evidencing the same or under which the same is outstanding it is provided that this indebtedness is not senior or prior in right of payment to the subordinated securities, and  \\x95 renewals, extensions, modifications and refundings of any such indebtedness.            if this prospectus is being delivered in connection with the offering of a series of subordinated securities, the accompanying prospectus supplement or term sheet will set forth the approximate amount of our senior indebtedness outstanding as of a recent date.         provisions applicable to the guaranteed debt indenture          full and unconditional guarantee by deere & company of john deere funding s.a. debt securities            all guaranteed debt securities issued by john deere funding s.a. will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed under a guarantee by deere & company of the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on and \"additional amounts\" with respect to these debt securities when due, whether at maturity or otherwise. for a discussion of the payment of \"additional amounts,\" please see \"\\x97payment of additional amounts with respect to the guaranteed debt securities\" below. under the terms of the full and unconditional guarantee, holders of the guaranteed debt securities will not be required to exercise their remedies against john deere funding s.a. before they proceed directly against deere & company.         payment of additional amounts with respect to the guaranteed debt securities            unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, all amounts of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on any guaranteed debt securities will be paid by john deere funding s.a. without deduction or withholding for any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed by or levied by or on behalf of the government of luxembourg (or, in the case of a successor to john deere funding s.a., of the jurisdiction in which such successor is organized) or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges are required by luxembourg. if deduction or withholding of any of these charges is required by luxembourg, or by a jurisdiction in which a   11        table of contents  successor to john deere funding s.a. is organized, john deere funding s.a. will pay as additional interest any additional amounts necessary to make the net amount paid to the affected holders equal the amount the holders would have received in the absence of the deduction or withholding. however, these \"additional amounts\" will not include:    \\x95 the amount of any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by united states or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein;  \\x95 the amount of any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for:     \\x95 the existence of any present or former connection between the holder, or a third party on behalf of a holder, by reason of its (or a fiduciary, settlor, member or shareholder, beneficiary of, or possessor of a power over, such holder, if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) having some present or former connection with luxembourg (or, in the case of a successor to john deere funding s.a., of the jurisdiction in which such successor is organized) (including being or having been a citizen or resident of luxembourg or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein) other than the mere holding of such guaranteed debt security; or    \\x95 the holder presented the guaranteed debt security for payment more than 30 days after the date on which the relevant payment became due or was provided for, whichever is later;   \\x95 the amount of any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on the principal of any premium or interest on the guaranteed debt securities;  \\x95 any amount of any tax, duty, assessment or other charge required to be withheld by a paying agent from a payment on a guaranteed debt security, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent;  \\x95 any amount of any tax, duty, assessment or other charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure to comply by the holder or the beneficial owner of a guaranteed debt security with a request of john deere funding s.a. or deere & company addressed to the older to provide information concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the united states or luxembourg of the holder or beneficial owner of the guaranteed debt security if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the united states or luxembourg as a precondition to relief or exemption from withholding or deduction of all or part of such tax, duty, assessment or other charge;   \\x95 any withholding or deduction which has been imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to the amended luxembourg law dated december 23, 2005 providing for a 20 percent final withholding tax on luxembourg resident individuals;  \\x95 the amount of any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property tax or any similar tax, duty, assessment or governmental charge; or  \\x95 any combination of the taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges described above.            additionally, additional amounts shall not be paid with respect to any payment in respect of any guaranteed debt security to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent such payment would be required by the laws of luxembourg (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) (or in the case of a successor person to john deere funding s.a. of the jurisdiction in which such successor person is   12        table of contents  organized or any political subdivision or tax authority thereof or therein) to be included in the income for tax purposes of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the holder of such guaranteed debt security.           the prospectus supplement or term sheet will describe any additional circumstances under which additional amounts will not be paid with respect to guaranteed debt securities.         optional tax redemption            unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, except in the case of guaranteed debt securities that have a variable rate of interest and that may be redeemed on any interest payment date, john deere funding s.a. may redeem each series of guaranteed debt securities at its option in whole but not in part at any time, if:    \\x95 john deere funding s.a. would be required to pay additional amounts, as a result of any change in the tax laws of the united states or luxembourg, or any jurisdiction in which a successor to john deere funding s.a. is organized, that becomes effective on or after the date of issuance of that series, as explained above under \"payment of additional amounts with respect to the guaranteed debt securities,\" or  \\x95 as a result of any change in any treaty affecting taxation to which luxembourg, or any jurisdiction in which a successor to john deere funding s.a. is organized, is a party that becomes effective on or after a date on which deere & company or an affiliate or subsidiary thereof borrows money from john deere funding s.a., deere & company or such affiliate or subsidiary thereof would be required to deduct or withhold tax on any payment to john deere funding s.a. to enable it to make any payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest.            except in the case of outstanding original issue discount guaranteed debt securities, which may be redeemed at the redemption price specified by the terms of that series of guaranteed debt securities, the redemption price will be equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.           in both of these cases, however, we will not be permitted to redeem a series of guaranteed debt securities if we can avoid either the payment of additional amounts, or deductions or withholding, as the case may be, by using reasonable commercial measures available to us.         provisions applicable to both of the indentures          issuance of securities in registered form            we may issue the debt securities in registered form, in which case we may issue them either in book-entry only form or in \"certificated\" form. debt securities issued in book-entry only form will be represented by global securities. we expect that we will usually issue debt securities in book-entry only form represented by global securities. the trustee shall maintain a register of the securities that are issued at its offices. a duplicate register of the trustee\\'s register for the guaranteed debt securities will be maintained by john deere funding s.a. at its registered office and shall be amended or updated each time the register maintained by the trustee is amended or updated. in case of discrepancy between the two registers, the register held at the registered office of john deere funding s.a. shall prevail.           we also will have the option of issuing debt securities in non-registered form as bearer securities if we issue the securities outside the united states to non-u.s. persons. in that case, the prospectus supplement or term sheet will set forth the mechanics for holding the bearer securities, including the procedures for receiving payments, for exchanging the bearer securities for registered securities of the   13        table of contents  same series, and for receiving notices. the prospectus supplement or term sheet will also describe the requirements with respect to our maintenance of offices or agencies outside the united states and the applicable u.s. federal tax law requirements.           book-entry holders.    we will issue registered debt securities in book-entry only form, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet. this means debt securities will be represented by one or more global securities registered in the name of a depositary that will hold them on behalf of financial institutions that participate in the depositary\\'s book-entry system. these participating institutions, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the debt securities held by the depositary or its nominee. these institutions may hold these interests on behalf of themselves or customers.            under each indenture, only the person in whose name a debt security is registered is recognized as the holder of that debt security. consequently, for debt securities issued in global form, we will recognize only the depositary as the holder of the debt securities and we will make all payments on the debt securities to the depositary. the depositary will then pass along the payments it receives to its participants, which in turn will pass the payments along to their customers who are the beneficial owners. the depositary and its participants do so under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers; they are not obligated to do so under the terms of the debt securities.            as a result, investors will not own debt securities directly. instead, they will own beneficial interests in a global security, through a bank, broker or other financial institution that participates in the depositary\\'s book-entry system or holds an interest through a participant. as long as the debt securities are issued in global form, investors will be indirect holders, and not holders, of the debt securities.            street name holders.    in the future, we may issue debt securities in certificated form or terminate a global security. in these cases, investors may choose to hold their debt securities in their own names or in \"street name.\" debt securities held in street name are registered in the name of a bank, broker or other financial institution chosen by the investor, and the investor would hold a beneficial interest in those debt securities through the account he or she maintains at that institution.           for debt securities held in street name, we will recognize only the intermediary banks, brokers and other financial institutions in whose names the debt securities are registered as the holders of those debt securities and we will make all payments on those debt securities to them. these institutions will pass along the payments they receive to their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. investors who hold debt securities in street name will be indirect holders, and not holders, of the debt securities.           legal holders.    our obligations, as well as the obligations of the applicable trustee and those of any third parties employed by us or the applicable trustee, run only to the legal holders of the debt securities. we do not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global securities, in street name or by any other indirect means. this will be the case whether an investor chooses to be an indirect holder of a debt security or has no choice because we are issuing the debt securities only in global form.           for example, once we make a payment or give a notice to the holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment or notice even if that holder is required, under agreements with depositary participants or customers or by law, to pass it along to the indirect holders but does not do so. similarly, if we want to obtain the approval of the holders for any purpose (for example, to amend an indenture or to relieve us of the consequences of a default or of our obligation to comply with a particular provision of an indenture), we would seek the approval only from the holders, and not the indirect holders, of the debt securities. whether and how the holders contact the indirect holders is up to the holders.   14         table of contents          when we refer to you, we mean those who invest in the debt securities being offered by this prospectus, whether they are the holders or only indirect holders of those debt securities. when we refer to your debt securities, we mean the debt securities in which you hold a direct or indirect interest.            special considerations for indirect holders.    if you hold debt securities through a bank, broker or other financial institution, either in book-entry only form or in street name, we urge you to check with that institution to find out:    \\x95 how it handles securities payments and notices;  \\x95 whether it imposes fees or charges;  \\x95 how it would handle a request for the indirect holder\\'s consent, if ever required;  \\x95 whether and how you can instruct it to send you debt securities registered in your own name so you can be a holder, if that is permitted in the future for a particular series of debt securities;  \\x95 how it would exercise rights under the debt securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for holders to act to protect their interests; and  \\x95 if the debt securities are in book-entry only form, how the depositary\\'s rules and procedures will affect these matters.           global securities            what is a global security? as noted above, we usually will issue debt securities as registered securities in book-entry only form. a global security represents one or any other number of individual debt securities. generally, all debt securities represented by the same global securities will have the same terms.           each debt security issued in book-entry only form will be represented by a global security that we deposit with and register in the name of a financial institution or its nominee that we select. the financial institution that we select for this purpose is called the depositary. unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, the depository trust company, new york, new york, known as dtc, will be the depositary for all debt securities issued in book-entry only form.           a global security may not be transferred to or registered in the name of anyone other than the depositary or its nominee, unless special termination situations arise. we describe those situations below under \"special situations when a global security will be terminated.\" as a result of these arrangements, the depositary, or its nominee, will be the sole registered owner and holder of all debt securities represented by a global security, and investors will be permitted to own only beneficial interests in a global security. beneficial interests must be held by means of an account with a broker, bank or other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary or with another institution that has an account with the depositary. thus, an investor whose security is represented by a global security will not be a holder of the debt security, but only an indirect holder of a beneficial interest in the global security.            special considerations for global securities.    as an indirect holder, an investor\\'s rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of the investor\\'s financial institution and of the depositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. the depositary that holds the global security will be considered the holder of the debt securities represented by the global security.   15        table of contents          if debt securities are issued only in the form of a global security, an investor should be aware of the following:    \\x95 an investor cannot cause the debt securities to be registered in his or her name, and cannot obtain non-global certificates for his or her interest in the debt securities, except in the special situations we describe below.  \\x95 an investor will be an indirect holder and must look to his or her own bank or broker for payments on the debt securities and protection of his or her legal rights relating to the debt securities, as we describe under \"issuance of securities in registered form\" above.  \\x95 an investor may not be able to sell interests in the debt securities to some insurance companies and other institutions that are required by law to own their securities in non-book-entry only form.  \\x95 an investor may not be able to pledge his or her interest in a global security in circumstances where certificates representing the debt securities must be delivered to the lender or other beneficiary of the pledge in order for the pledge to be effective.  \\x95 the depositary\\'s policies, which may change from time to time, will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to an investor\\'s interest in a global security. we and the trustee have no responsibility for any aspect of the depositary\\'s actions or for its records of ownership interests in a global security. we and the trustee also do not supervise the depositary in any way.  \\x95 if less than all the debt securities are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee will select debt securities to be redeemed on a pro rata basis or by any other method the trustee deems fair and appropriate.  \\x95 an investor is required to give notice of exercise of any option to elect repayment of its debt securities, through its participant, to the applicable trustee and to deliver the related debt securities by causing its participant to transfer its interest in those debt securities, on dtc\\'s records, to the applicable trustee.   \\x95 dtc requires that those who purchase and sell interests in a global security deposited in its book-entry system use immediately available funds. your broker or bank may also require you to use immediately available funds when purchasing or selling interests in a global security.  \\x95 financial institutions that participate in the depositary\\'s book-entry system, and through which an investor holds its interest in a global security, may also have their own policies affecting payments, notices and other matters relating to the debt securities. there may be more than one financial intermediary in the chain of ownership for an investor. we do not monitor and are not responsible for the actions of any of those intermediaries.             special situations when a global security will be terminated.    in a few special situations described below, a global security will be terminated and interests in it will be exchanged for certificates in non-global form (certificated securities). after that exchange, the choice of whether to hold the certificated debt securities directly or in street name will be up to the investor. investors must consult their own banks or brokers to find out how to have their interests in a global security transferred on termination to their own names, so that they will be holders. we have described the rights of holders and street name investors under \"issuance of securities in registered form\" above.           the special situations for termination of a global security are as follows:    \\x95 if the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling, unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary for that global security, and we do not appoint another institution to act as depositary within 60 days;   16        table of contents    \\x95 if we notify the trustee that we wish to terminate that global security (subject to dtc\\'s procedures); or   \\x95 if an event of default has occurred with regard to the debt securities represented by that global security and has not been cured or waived; we discuss defaults later under \"events of default.\"            the prospectus supplement or term sheet may list situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the particular series of debt securities covered by the prospectus supplement or term sheet. if a global security is terminated, only the depositary, and not we or the applicable trustee, is responsible for deciding the institutions in whose names the debt securities represented by the global security will be registered and, therefore, who will be the holders of those debt securities.         payment and paying agents            we will pay interest to the person listed in the applicable trustee\\'s records as the owner of the debt security at the close of business on a particular day in advance of each due date for interest, even if that person no longer owns the debt security on the interest due date. that day, usually about two weeks in advance of the interest due date, is called the \"record date.\" because we will pay all the interest for an interest period to the holders on the record date, holders buying and selling debt securities must work out between themselves the appropriate purchase price. the most common manner is to adjust the sales price of the debt securities to prorate interest fairly between buyer and seller based on their respective ownership periods within the particular interest period. this prorated interest amount is called \"accrued interest.\"           except as set forth in the indentures and as described below under \"\\x97defeasance\\x97covenant defeasance\" and \"\\x97defeasance\\x97full defeasance,\" upon deposit of payment in full with the trustee or paying agent for the benefit of the holders of such securities, our payment obligations with respect to the debt securities of such series are extinguished, regardless of whether the trustee\\'s or paying agent\\'s payment to holders is thereafter prohibited or otherwise restricted.            payments on global securities.    we will make payments on a global security in accordance with the applicable policies of the depositary as in effect from time to time. under those policies, we will make payments directly to the depositary, or its nominee, and not to any indirect holders who own beneficial interests in the global security. an indirect holder\\'s right to those payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depositary and its participants, as described under \"global securities\\x97what is a global security?\"            payments on certificated securities.    we will make payments on a debt security in non-global certificated form as follows. we will pay interest that is due on an interest payment date (as defined below) by check mailed on the interest payment date to the holder at his or her address shown on the applicable trustee\\'s records as of the close of business on the regular record date (defined below). we will make all payments of principal and premium, if any, by check at the office of the applicable trustee in new york, ny and/or at other offices that may be specified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet or in a notice to holders, against surrender of the debt security.           alternatively, if the holder asks us to do so, we will pay any amount that becomes due on the debt security by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account at a bank in the city of new york on the due date. to request payment by wire, the holder must give the applicable trustee or other paying agent appropriate transfer instructions at least 15 business days before the requested wire payment is due. in the case of any interest payment due on an interest payment date, the instructions must be given by the person who is the holder on the relevant regular record date. any wire instructions, once properly given, will remain in effect unless and until new instructions are given in the manner described above.   17                                             table of contents            payment when offices are closed.    if any payment is due on a debt security on a day that is not a business day, we will make the payment on the next day that is a business day. payments made on the next business day in this situation will be treated under the indentures as if they were made on the original due date, except as otherwise indicated in the attached prospectus supplement or term sheet. such payment will not result in a default under any debt security or indenture, and no interest will accrue on the payment amount from the original due date to the next day that is a business day.           book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debt securities.        optional redemption, repayment and repurchase            the prospectus supplement or term sheet for a debt security will indicate whether deere & company or john deere funding s.a. will have the option to redeem the debt security issued by it before the stated maturity and the price and date(s) or period(s) on which or during which redemption may occur. if we are allowed to redeem a debt security, we may exercise the option by notifying the trustee and the paying agent at least 60 days prior to the redemption date. at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date, the trustee will mail notice or cause the paying agent to mail notice of redemption to the holders. if a debt security is only redeemed in part, we will issue a new debt security or debt securities for the unredeemed portion.           unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, any right granted to john deere funding s.a. to optionally redeem a debt security issued by it will be in addition to its right to redeem a debt security in the event certain tax events occur, to the extent set forth above under \"\\x97optional tax redemption.\"           the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to a debt security will also indicate whether you will have the option to elect repayment by the applicable issuer prior to the stated maturity and the price and the date(s) or period(s) on which or during which repayment may occur.           for a debt security to be repaid at your election, we must receive, at least 30 but not more than 45 days prior to an optional repayment date, if, in certificated form, such debt security with the form entitled \"option to elect repayment\" on the reverse of the debt security duly completed. you may also send the paying agent a facsimile or letter from a member of a national securities exchange or the financial industry regulatory authority (\"finra\") or a commercial bank or trust company in the united states describing the particulars of the repayment, including a guarantee that the debt security and the form entitled \"option to elect repayment\" will be received by the paying agent no later than five business days after such facsimile or letter. if you present a debt security for repayment, such act will be irrevocable. you may exercise the repayment option for less than the entire principal of the debt security, provided the remaining principal outstanding is an authorized denomination. if you elect partial repayment, your debt security will be cancelled, and we will issue a new debt security or debt securities for the remaining amount.            dtc or its nominee will be the holder of each global security and will be the only party that can exercise a right of repayment. if you are a beneficial owner of a global security and you want to exercise your right of repayment, you must instruct your broker or indirect participant through which you hold your interest to notify dtc. you should consult your broker or such indirect participant to discuss the appropriate cut-off times and any other requirements for giving this instruction. the giving of any such instruction will be irrevocable.           if a debt security is an original issue discount debt security (\"oid note\") (other than an indexed note, as defined below), the amount payable in the event of redemption or repayment prior to its stated maturity will be the amortized face amount on the redemption or repayment date, as the case may be. the amortized face amount of an oid note will be equal to (i) the issue price specified in the   18        table of contents  applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet plus (ii) that portion of the difference between the issue price and the principal amount of the debt security that has accrued at the yield to maturity described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet (computed in accordance with generally accepted u.s. bond yield computation principles) by the redemption or repayment date. however, in no case will the amortized face amount of an oid note exceed its principal amount.           we may at any time purchase debt securities at any price in the open market or otherwise. we may hold, resell or surrender for cancellation any debt securities that we purchase.         conversion and exchange            if any debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable for other securities, the prospectus supplement or term sheet will explain the terms and conditions of the conversion or exchange, including the conversion price or exchange ratio (or the calculation method), the conversion or exchange period (or how the period will be determined), if conversion or exchange will be mandatory or at the option of the holder or us, provisions for adjusting the conversion price or the exchange ratio and provisions affecting conversion or exchange in the event of the redemption of the underlying debt securities. these terms may also include provisions under which the number or amount of other securities to be received by the holders of the debt securities upon conversion or exchange would be calculated according to the market price of the other securities as of a time stated in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.          interest and interest rates            general              each debt security will begin to accrue interest from the date it is originally issued or from a specified date. the related prospectus supplement or term sheet will specify each debt security as a fixed rate note, a floating rate note, an amortizing note or an indexed note and set forth the interest rate or describe the method of determining the interest rate, including any spread and/or spread multiplier. for an indexed note, the related prospectus supplement or term sheet also will describe the method for the calculation and payment of principal and interest. the prospectus supplement or term sheet for a floating rate note or indexed note may also specify a maximum and a minimum interest rate. unless otherwise specified in the related prospectus supplement or term sheet, the minimum interest rate for each relevant interest reset period on a floating rate note shall be zero percent.           a debt security may be issued as a fixed rate note or a floating rate note or as a note that combines fixed and floating rate terms.            each interest payment on a debt security will include interest accrued from, and including, the issue date, a specified date or the last interest payment date, as the case may be, to but excluding the applicable interest payment date or the maturity date (as defined below), as the case may be.           interest on the debt securities denominated in u.s. dollars will be paid by check mailed on an interest payment date other than a maturity date to the persons entitled thereto at the addresses of such holders as they appear in the security register or, at our option, by wire transfer to a bank account maintained by the holder. the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on debt securities denominated in u.s. dollars, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon, due on the maturity date will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such debt securities at the corporate trust office of the applicable trustee in the city of new york, or, at our option, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account with a bank designated at least 15 calendar days prior to the maturity date by the applicable registered holder, provided the particular bank has appropriate facilities to receive these payments and the particular debt security is presented and   19        table of contents  surrendered at the office or agency maintained by us for this purpose in the city of new york, in time for the trustee to make these payments in accordance with its normal procedures.           fixed rate notes              the prospectus supplement or term sheet for debt securities with a fixed interest rate (\"fixed rate notes\") will specify a fixed interest rate payable semiannually in arrears on dates specified in such prospectus supplement or term sheet (each, with respect to fixed rate notes, an \"interest payment date\"). unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement or term sheet, interest on fixed rate notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. if the stated maturity date, any redemption date or any repayment date (together referred to as the \"maturity date\") or an interest payment date for any fixed rate note is not a business day, principal of, premium, if any, and interest on that note will be paid on the next business day, and no interest will accrue from and after the maturity date or interest payment date on the payment so deferred. interest on fixed rate notes will be paid to holders of record as of each regular record date. unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement or term sheet, a \"regular record date\" will be the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a business day) preceding the applicable interest payment date.           original issue discount notes              we may issue oid notes (including zero coupon debt securities), which are debt securities issued at a discount from the principal amount payable on the maturity date. there may not be any periodic interest payments on oid notes. for oid notes, interest normally accrues during the life of the note and is paid on the maturity date. upon a redemption, repayment or acceleration of the maturity of an oid note, the amount payable will be determined as set forth under \"\\x97optional redemption, repayment and repurchase.\" this amount normally is less than the amount payable on the stated maturity date.           amortizing notes              we may issue amortizing debt securities, which are fixed rate notes for which combined principal and interest payments are made in installments over the life of each debt security (\"amortizing notes\"). payments on amortizing notes are applied first to interest due and then to the reduction of the unpaid principal amount. the related prospectus supplement or term sheet for an amortizing note will include a table setting forth repayment information.           floating rate notes              each debt security whose interest is determined by reference to an interest rate basis or formula is referred to herein as a \"floating rate note.\" that basis or formula may be based on:    \\x95 the commercial paper rate;  \\x95 libor;  \\x95 euribor;  \\x95 the federal funds rate;  \\x95 the prime rate;  \\x95 the treasury rate;  \\x95 the cmt rate;  \\x95 the eleventh district cost of funds rate; or   20        table of contents    \\x95 another negotiated interest rate basis or formula.            the prospectus supplement or term sheet will also indicate any spread and/or spread multiplier, which would be applied to the interest rate formula to determine the interest rate. any floating rate note may have a maximum or minimum interest rate limitation. in addition to any maximum interest rate limitation, the interest rate on the floating rate notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by new york law, as the same may be modified by united states law of general application.           we will appoint a calculation agent to calculate interest rates on the floating rate notes. unless we identify a different party in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, the paying agent will be the calculation agent for each note.           unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement or term sheet, the \"calculation date,\" if applicable, relating to an interest determination date will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such interest determination date or, if such day is not a business day, the next succeeding business day, or (ii) the business day immediately preceding the relevant interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be.           upon the request of the beneficial holder of any floating rate note, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if different, when available, the interest rate that will become effective on the next interest reset date (as defined below) for the floating rate note.            change of interest rate.    the interest rate on each floating rate note may be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually or on some other specified basis. this period is an \"interest reset period\" and the first day of each interest reset period is an \"interest reset date.\" unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement or term sheet, the interest reset date will be:    \\x95 for notes with interest that resets daily, each business day;  \\x95 for notes (other than treasury rate notes) with interest that resets weekly, wednesday of each week;   \\x95 for treasury rate notes with interest that resets weekly, tuesday of each week;  \\x95 for notes with interest that resets monthly, the third wednesday of each month;  \\x95 for notes with interest that resets quarterly, the third wednesday of march, june, september and december of each year;   \\x95 for notes with interest that resets semiannually, the third wednesday of each of the two months of each year indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet; and  \\x95 for notes with interest that resets annually, the third wednesday of the month of each year indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet.            the related prospectus supplement or term sheet will describe the initial interest rate or interest rate formula on each note. that rate will be effective until the following interest reset date. thereafter, the interest rate will be the rate determined on each interest determination date. each time a new interest rate is determined, it becomes effective on the following interest reset date. if any interest reset date is not a business day, then the interest reset date is postponed to the next business day, except, in the case of libor and euribor notes, if the next business day is in the next calendar month, the interest reset date is the immediately preceding business day.            date interest rate is determined.    the interest determination date for all cmt rate notes is the second business day before the interest reset date and for all libor notes will be the second london business day immediately preceding the applicable interest reset date (unless the libor currency is sterling, in which case the interest determination date will be the interest reset date).   21        table of contents          the interest determination date for euribor notes will be the second target business day immediately preceding the applicable interest reset date.           the interest determination date for treasury rate notes will be the day of the week in which the interest reset date falls on which treasury bills of the index maturity are normally auctioned. the \"index maturity\" is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation with respect to which the related interest rate basis or formula will be calculated. treasury bills are usually sold at auction on monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held on tuesday. sometimes, the auction is held on the preceding friday. if an auction is held on the preceding friday, that day will be the interest determination date relating to the interest reset date occurring in the next week.           the interest determination date for all commercial paper rate, federal funds rate and prime rate notes will be the first business day preceding the interest reset date.            the interest determination date for an eleventh district cost of funds rate note is the last business day of the month immediately preceding the applicable interest reset date in which the federal home loan bank of san francisco published the applicable rate.           the interest determination date relating to a floating rate note with an interest rate that is determined by reference to two or more interest rate bases will be the most recent business day which is at least two business days before the applicable interest reset date for each interest rate for the applicable floating rate note on which each interest rate basis is determinable.            payment of interest.    unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement or term sheet, interest is paid as follows:    \\x95 for notes with interest that resets daily, weekly or monthly, on the third wednesday of each month;  \\x95 for notes with interest payable quarterly, on the third wednesday of march, june, september, and december of each year;   \\x95 for notes with interest payable semiannually, on the third wednesday of each of the two months specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet;  \\x95 for notes with interest payable annually, on the third wednesday of the month specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet (each of the above, with respect to floating rate notes, an \"interest payment date\"); and  \\x95 at maturity, redemption or repayment.            interest on a floating rate note will be payable beginning on the first interest payment date after its issue date to holders of record at the close of business on each regular record date, which is the fifteenth day (whether or not a business day) next preceding the applicable interest payment date, unless the issue date falls after a regular record date and on or prior to the related interest payment date, in which case payment will be made to holders of record at the close of business on the regular record date next preceding the second interest payment date following the issue date. if an interest payment date (but not the maturity date) is not a business day then the interest payment date will be postponed to the next business day. however, in the case of libor and euribor notes, if the next business day is in the next calendar month, the interest payment date will be the immediately preceding business day. if the maturity date of any floating rate note is not a business day, principal of, premium, if any, and interest on that note will be paid on the next business day, and no interest will accrue from and after the maturity date on the payment so deferred.           accrued interest on a floating rate note is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a note by an accrued interest factor. the accrued interest factor is the sum of the interest factors   22        table of contents  calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. the interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day by (1) the actual number of days in the year, in the case of treasury rate notes or cmt rate notes, or (2) 360, in the case of other floating rate notes. the interest factor for floating rate notes for which the interest rate is calculated with reference to two or more interest rate bases will be calculated in each period in the same manner as if only one of the applicable interest rate bases applied. all percentages resulting from any calculation are rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. for example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). dollar amounts used in the calculation are rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).            commercial paper rate notes.    the \"commercial paper rate\" for any interest determination date is the money market yield of the rate on that date for commercial paper having the index maturity

information pertaining to the method of determining the interest payments and the principal amount will be described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, as well as additional risk factors unique to the indexed note, certain historical information for the specified indexed item and certain additional united states federal income tax considerations.         renewable notes            we may issue debt securities, which we call \"renewable notes,\" that will automatically renew at their stated maturity date unless the holder of a renewable note elects to terminate the automatic extension feature by giving notice in the manner described in the related prospectus supplement or term sheet. in addition, we may issue debt securities whose stated maturity date may be extended at the option of the holder for one or more periods, as more fully described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to such securities.           the holder of a renewable note must give notice of termination at least 15 but not more than 30 days prior to a renewal date. the holder of a renewable note may terminate the automatic extension for less than all of its renewable notes only if the terms of the renewable note specifically permit partial termination. an election to terminate the automatic extension of any portion of the renewable note is not revocable and will be binding on the holder of the renewable note. if the holder elects to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of the note, the holder will become entitled to the principal and interest accrued up to the renewal date. the related prospectus supplement or term sheet will identify a stated maturity date beyond which the maturity date cannot be renewed.           if a renewable note is represented by a global security, dtc or its nominee will be the holder of the note and therefore will be the only entity that can exercise a right to terminate the automatic extension of a note. in order to ensure that dtc or its nominee will exercise a right to terminate the automatic extension provisions of a particular renewable note, the beneficial owner of the note must instruct the broker or other dtc participant through which it holds an interest in the note to notify dtc of its desire to terminate the automatic extension of the note. different firms have different cut-off times for accepting instructions from their customers and, accordingly, each beneficial owner should consult the broker or other participant through which it holds an interest in a note to ascertain the cut-off time by which an instruction must be given for delivery of timely notice to dtc or its   31        table of contents   nominee. specific information pertaining to united states federal income tax considerations for renewable notes will be described in an applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet.         extendible notes            we may issue debt securities, which we call \"extendible notes,\" whose stated maturity date may be extended at our option for one or more whole-year periods (each, an \"extension period\"), up to but not beyond a stated maturity date described in the related prospectus supplement or term sheet.            we may exercise our option to extend the extendible notes by notifying the applicable trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to the then effective maturity date. if we elect to extend the extendible notes, the trustee (or paying agent) will mail (at least 40 days prior to the maturity date) to the registered holder of the extendible notes a notice (an \"extension notice\") informing the holders of our election, the new maturity date and any updated terms. upon the mailing of the extension notice, the maturity of the extendible notes will be extended automatically as set forth in the extension notice.           however, we may, not later than 20 days prior to the maturity date of an extendible note (or, if that date is not a business day, prior to the next business day), at our option, establish a higher interest rate, in the case of a fixed rate note, or a higher spread and/or spread multiplier, in the case of a floating rate note, for the extension period by mailing or causing the applicable trustee (or paying agent) to mail notice of such higher interest rate or higher spread and/or spread multiplier to the holders of the notes. the notice will be irrevocable.           if we elect to extend the maturity of extendible notes, the holders of the notes will have the option to instead elect repayment of the notes by us on the maturity date in effect prior to such extension, at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus interest accrued to such date. in order for an extendible note to be so repaid on the maturity date, we must receive, at least 25 days but not more than 35 days prior to the maturity date:             (1)   the extendible note with the form \"option to elect repayment\" on the reverse of the note duly completed; or           (2)   a facsimile transmission, telex or letter from a member of a national securities exchange or finra or a commercial bank or trust company in the united states setting forth the name of the holder of the extendible note, the principal amount of the note, the principal amount of the note to be repaid, the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms of the note, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby and a guarantee that the note be repaid, together with the duly completed form entitled \"option to elect repayment\" on the reverse of the note, will be received by the applicable trustee (or paying agent) not later than the fifth business day after the date of the facsimile transmission, telex or letter;  provided, however, that the facsimile transmission, telex or letter will only be effective if the note and form duly completed are received by the applicable trustee (or paying agent) by that fifth business day. the option may be exercised by the holder of an extendible note for less than the aggregate principal amount of the note then outstanding if the principal amount of the note remaining outstanding after repayment is an authorized denomination.             if an extendible note is represented by a global security, dtc or its nominee will be the holder of that note and therefore will be the only entity that can exercise a right to repayment. to ensure that dtc or its nominee timely exercises a right to repayment with respect to a particular extendible note, the beneficial owner of that note must instruct the broker or other participant through which it holds an interest in the note to notify dtc of its desire to exercise a right of repayment. different firms have different cut-off times for accepting instructions from their customers and, accordingly, each beneficial owner should consult the broker or other participant through which it holds an interest in an   32        table of contents  extendible note to determine the cut-off time by which an instruction must be given for timely notice to be delivered to dtc or its nominee. specific information pertaining to united states federal income tax considerations for the extendible notes will be described in an applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet.         events of default            you will have special rights if an event of default occurs in respect of the debt securities of your series and is not cured, as described later in this subsection.           what is an event of default? the term \"event of default\" in respect of the debt securities of your series means any of the following:    \\x95 we do not pay the principal of, or any premium, if any, on a debt security of the series when it becomes due and payable at its maturity.   \\x95 we do not pay interest, and in the case of the guaranteed debt securities any additional amounts, on a debt security of the series within 30 days of its due date.  \\x95 we do not deposit any sinking fund payment in respect of debt securities of the series on its due date.   \\x95 we remain in breach of a covenant in respect of debt securities of the series for 60 days after we receive a written notice of default specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied. the notice must be sent by either the trustee or holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of debt securities of the series.   \\x95 in the case of the guaranteed debt securities, the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect or deere & company denies, or gives notice, that it has no further liability under the guarantee (other than by reason of the termination of the guaranteed debt indenture or the release of such guarantee in accordance with the guaranteed debt indenture), and such condition continues for 30 days after we receive a written notice of such default.  \\x95 we file for bankruptcy or certain other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur.  \\x95 any other event of default in respect of debt securities of the series described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet occurs.            an event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series of debt securities issued under the same or any other indenture. the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default, except in the payment of principal, premium or interest, if it considers the withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders.            remedies if an event of default occurs.    if an event of default, other than an event of default caused by our filing for bankruptcy or certain other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurring, has occurred and has not been cured, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the affected series may declare the entire principal amount (or, if any securities are original issue discount securities or indexed securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms thereof) of all the debt securities of that series to be due and immediately payable by a notice in writing to deere & company. this is called a declaration of acceleration of maturity. a declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the affected series.           except in cases of default, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the applicable indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from costs, expenses and liability to be incurred in compliance with   33        table of contents  such request (called an \"indemnity\"). if reasonable indemnity is provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. the trustee may refuse to follow those directions in certain circumstances. no delay or omission in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon any event of default will impair any such right or remedy or be treated as a waiver of any such event of default or acquiescence therein.           if an event of default caused by our filing for bankruptcy or certain other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs and is continuing, then the principal amount of all debt securities issued under the applicable indenture, together with any accrued interest through the occurrence of such event, shall become and be due and payable immediately, without any declaration or other act by the trustee or any other holder.           before you are allowed to bypass your trustee and bring your own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce your rights or protect your interests relating to the debt securities, the following must occur:    \\x95 you must give your trustee written notice that an event of default has occurred and remains uncured.   \\x95 the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of the relevant series must make a written request that the trustee take action because of the default and must offer reasonable indemnity to the trustee against the cost and other liabilities of taking that action.  \\x95 the trustee must not have taken action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity.   \\x95 the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities must not have given the trustee a direction inconsistent with the above notice during that 60-day period.            however, you are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on your debt securities on or after the due date.            holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the affected series may waive any past defaults other than:    \\x95 the payment of principal, any premium or interest, or  \\x95 in respect of a covenant that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder.            book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how to give notice or direction to or make a request of the trustee and how to declare or cancel an acceleration.          each year, we will furnish to each trustee a written statement of certain of our officers certifying that to their knowledge we are in compliance with the applicable indenture and the debt securities, or else specifying any default.          merger or consolidation            under the terms of the indentures, we are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another entity. we are also permitted to sell all or substantially all of our assets to another entity. however, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met:    \\x95 where we merge out of existence or sell all or substantially all of our assets, the resulting entity must agree to be legally responsible for the debt securities.   34                                                 table of contents     \\x95 the merger or sale of assets must not cause a default on the debt securities and we must not already be in default (unless the merger or sale would cure the default). for purposes of this no-default test, a default would include an event of default that has occurred and has not been cured, as described above under \"what is an event of default?\" a default for this purpose would also include any event that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving us a notice of default or our default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded.  \\x95 under the deere indenture or the guaranteed debt indenture, no merger or sale of assets may be made if as a result any of our property or assets or any property or assets of one of our restricted subsidiaries would become subject to any mortgage, lien or other encumbrance unless either (i) the mortgage, lien or other encumbrance could be created pursuant to the limitation on liens covenant in the applicable indenture (see \"\\x97limitation on liens\" below) without equally and ratably securing the indenture securities issued under that indenture or (ii) the indenture securities are secured equally and ratably with or prior to the debt secured by the mortgage, lien or other encumbrance.   \\x95 we must deliver certain certificates and documents to the trustee.  \\x95 we must satisfy any other requirements specified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to a particular series of debt securities.            if john deere funding s.a. is required to pay additional amounts, deere & company or any of its subsidiaries may directly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the trustee, in form satisfactory to the trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on and any additional amounts with respect to all the debt securities and the performance or observance of every covenant of the guaranteed debt indenture by john deere funding s.a. upon any such assumption, deere & company or such subsidiary shall succeed to, and be substituted for and may exercise every right and power of, john deere funding s.a. under the guaranteed debt indenture with the same effect as if deere & company or such subsidiary had been named as john deere funding s.a. therein, and john deere funding s.a. will be released from all obligations and covenants with respect to the debt securities. no such assumption will be permitted unless deere & company has delivered to the guaranteed debt trustee (i) an officers\\' certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer and such assumption and supplemental indenture comply with the guaranteed debt indenture, and that all conditions precedent therein provided for relating to the transaction have been complied with and that, in the event of assumption by a subsidiary, the guarantee and all other covenants of deere & company in the guaranteed debt indenture remain in full force and effect and (ii) an opinion of independent counsel that the holders of debt securities or related coupons (assuming such holders are only taxed as residents of the united states) will have no materially adverse united states federal tax consequences as a result of such assumption, and that, if any debt securities are then listed on the new york stock exchange, that such debt securities will not be delisted as a result of such assumption.         modification or waiver            there are three types of changes we can make to either indenture and the debt securities issued thereunder.            changes requiring your approval.    first, there are changes that we cannot make to your debt securities without your specific approval. following is a list of those types of changes:    \\x95 change the stated maturity of, the principal of (or premium, if any, on), interest or any additional amounts on a debt security;   \\x95 reduce the portion of principal of an original issue security or indexed security that would be due and payable upon acceleration of the maturity of a security following a default;   35        table of contents    \\x95 adversely affect any right of repayment at the holder\\'s option;  \\x95 change the place (except as otherwise described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet) or currency of payment on a debt security;   \\x95 impair your right to sue for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the stated maturity;  \\x95 adversely affect any right to convert or exchange a debt security in accordance with its terms;  \\x95 modify the subordination provisions in the deere indenture in a manner that is adverse to holders of the subordinated securities;   \\x95 reduce the percentage of holders of debt securities whose consent is needed to modify or amend the applicable indenture;   \\x95 reduce the percentage of holders of debt securities whose consent is needed to waive compliance with certain provisions of the applicable indenture or to waive certain defaults;  \\x95 modify any other aspect of the provisions of the applicable indenture dealing with supplemental indentures, modification and waiver of certain past defaults, changes to the quorum or voting requirements or the waiver of certain covenants;  \\x95 in the case of the guaranteed debt securities, change in any manner adverse to holders, the terms and conditions of deere & company\\'s obligations as guarantor to pay principal, premium, if any, interest and any sinking fund with respect to the guaranteed debt securities or change any obligation to pay additional amounts, as explained above under \"payment of additional amounts with respect to the guaranteed debt securities\"; and  \\x95 in the case of the deere indenture, change any obligation we have to pay additional amounts.            changes not requiring approval.    the second type of change does not require any vote by the holders of the debt securities. this type is limited to clarifications and certain other changes that would not adversely affect holders of the outstanding debt securities in any material respect. we also do not need any approval to make any change that affects only debt securities to be issued under either indenture after the change takes effect.            changes requiring majority approval.    any other change to either of the indentures and the debt securities would require the following approval:    \\x95 if the change affects only one series of debt securities, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series; and  \\x95 if the change affects more than one series of debt securities issued under the same indenture, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all of the series affected by the change, with all affected series voting together as one class for this purpose.    in each case, the required approval must be given by written consent.            the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all of the series affected by noncompliance, voting together as one class for this purpose, may waive our compliance with some of our covenants in that indenture. however, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or of any of the matters covered by the bullet points included above under \"\\x97changes requiring your approval.\"   36        table of contents           further details concerning voting.    when taking a vote, we will use the following rules to decide how much principal to attribute to a debt security:    \\x95 for original issue discount securities, we will use the principal amount that would be due and payable on the voting date if the maturity of these debt securities were accelerated to that date because of a default.  \\x95 for debt securities whose principal amount is not known (for example, because it is based on an index), we will use a special rule for that debt security described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.  \\x95 for debt securities denominated in one or more foreign currencies, we will use the u.s. dollar equivalent.            debt securities will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not eligible to vote, if we have deposited or set aside in trust money for their payment or redemption. debt securities will also not be eligible to vote if they have been fully defeased as described below under \"defeasance\\x97full defeasance.\"            we will generally be entitled to set any date as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding indenture securities that are entitled to vote or take other action under the indentures. if we set a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of one or more series, that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding indenture securities of those series on the record date and must be taken within eleven months following the record date.           book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the applicable indenture or the debt securities or request a waiver.        defeasance            the following provisions will be applicable to each series of debt securities unless we state in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet that the provisions of covenant defeasance and full defeasance will not be applicable to that series.            covenant defeasance.    under current united states federal tax law, we can make the deposit described below and be released from some of the restrictive covenants in the indenture under which the particular series was issued. this is called \"covenant defeasance.\" in that event, you would lose the protection of those restrictive covenants but would gain the protection of having money and government securities set aside in trust to repay your debt securities. if you hold subordinated securities, you also would be released from the subordination provisions described under \"\\x97provisions applicable to the deere indenture\\x97subordination.\" in order to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do the following:    \\x95 if the debt securities of the particular series are denominated in u.s. dollars, we must deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders of such debt securities a combination of money and united states government or united states government agency notes or bonds that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other payments on the debt securities on their various due dates.  \\x95 we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel confirming that, under current united states federal income tax law and, in the case of guaranteed debt securities under current tax laws of luxembourg, we may make the above deposit without causing you to be taxed on the debt securities any differently than if we did not make the deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves at maturity.   37        table of contents    \\x95 we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel stating that the above deposit does not require registration of the applicable issuer under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (the \"investment company act\"), and a legal opinion and officers\\' certificate stating that all conditions precedent to covenant defeasance have been complied with or that all necessary registrations under the investment company act have been effected.  \\x95 in the case of the guaranteed debt indenture we must deliver to the trustee an officers\\' certificate stating that any outstanding securities listed on any securities exchange will not be delisted as a result of the above deposit.            if we accomplish covenant defeasance, you can still look to us for repayment of the debt securities if there were a shortfall in the trust deposit or the trustee is prevented from making payment. in fact, if one of the remaining events of default occurred (such as our bankruptcy) and the debt securities became immediately due and payable, there might be a shortfall. depending on the event causing the default, you may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall.            full defeasance.    if there is a change in united states federal tax law, as described below, we can legally release ourselves from all payment and other obligations on the debt securities of a particular series (called \"full defeasance\") if we put in place the following other arrangements for you to be repaid:    \\x95 if the debt securities of the particular series are denominated in u.s. dollars, we must deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders of such debt securities a combination of money and united states government or united states government agency notes or bonds that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other payments on the debt securities on their various due dates.  \\x95 we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming that there has been a change in current united states federal tax law or an internal revenue service ruling that allows us to make, and, in the case of guaranteed debt securities, under the then existing current tax laws of luxembourg, we may make the above deposit without causing you to be taxed on the debt securities any differently than if we did not make the deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves at maturity. under current united states federal tax law, the deposit and our legal release from the debt securities would be treated as though we paid you your share of the cash and notes or bonds at the time the cash and notes or bonds were deposited in trust in exchange for your debt securities and you would recognize gain or loss on the debt securities at the time of the deposit.  \\x95 we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion stating that the above deposit does not require registration of the applicable issuer under the investment company act and a legal opinion and officers\\' certificate stating that all conditions precedent to covenant defeasance have been complied with or that all necessary registrations under the investment company act have been effected.  \\x95 in the case of the guaranteed debt indenture, we must deliver to the trustee an officers\\' certificate stating that any outstanding securities listed on any securities exchange will not be delisted as a result of the above deposit.            we must, in the case of guaranteed debt securities, deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel confirming that under the current tax laws of luxembourg, we may make the above deposit without causing you to be taxed on the debt securities any differently than if we did not make the deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves at maturity.           if we ever did accomplish full defeasance, as described above, you would have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment of the debt securities. you could not look to us for repayment in the   38        table of contents  unlikely event of any shortfall. conversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever became bankrupt or insolvent. if you hold subordinated securities, you would also be released from the subordination provisions described under \"\\x97provisions applicable to the deere indenture\\x97subordination.\"         form, exchange and transfer of registered securities            if registered debt securities cease to be issued in global form, they will be issued:    \\x95 only in fully registered certificated form,  \\x95 without interest coupons, and  \\x95 unless we indicate otherwise in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, in denominations of u.s. moneytoken  and amounts that are integral multiples of u.s. moneytoken             holders may exchange their certificated securities for debt securities of smaller authorized denominations or combined into fewer debt securities of larger denominations, as long as the total principal amount is not changed.           holders may exchange or transfer their certificated securities at the office of their trustee. we have appointed the trustee to act as our agent for registering debt securities in the names of holders transferring debt securities. we may appoint another entity to perform these functions or perform them ourselves.           holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange their certificated securities, but they may be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge associated with the transfer or exchange. the transfer or exchange will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holder\\'s proof of legal ownership.           if we have designated additional transfer agents for your debt security, they will be named in your prospectus supplement or term sheet. we may appoint additional transfer agents or cancel the appointment of any particular transfer agent. we may also approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts.           if any certificated securities of a particular series are redeemable and we redeem less than all the debt securities of that series, we may block the transfer or exchange of those debt securities during the period beginning 15 days before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing, in order to freeze the list of holders to prepare the mailing. we may also refuse to register transfers or exchanges of any certificated securities selected for redemption, except that we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any debt security that will be partially redeemed.           if a registered debt security is issued in global form, only the depositary will be entitled to transfer and exchange the debt security as described in this subsection, since it will be the sole holder of the debt security.          resignation of trustee            each trustee may resign or be removed with respect to one or more series of indenture securities  provided that a successor trustee is appointed to act with respect to such series. in the event that two or more persons are acting as trustee with respect to different series of indenture securities under one of the indentures, each of the trustees will be a trustee of a trust separate and apart from the trust administered by any other trustee.   39        table of contents        limitation on liens            we covenant in the indentures that we will not, nor will we permit any restricted subsidiary to, issue, incur, assume or guarantee any debt (\"debt\") if the debt is secured by any mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien or other encumbrance (collectively, a \"mortgage\" or \"mortgages\") upon any important property (defined below) of ours or any restricted subsidiary or any shares of stock or indebtedness of any restricted subsidiary, whether owned at the date of the applicable indenture or thereafter acquired, without effectively securing the indenture securities issued under that indenture equally and ratably with or prior to this debt.           the foregoing restrictions will not apply to, among other things:    \\x95 mortgages on any property acquired, constructed or improved after the date of the applicable indenture that are created or assumed within 120 days after the acquisition, construction or improvement to secure or provide for the payment of all or any part of the purchase price or cost thereof incurred after the date of the applicable indenture, or existing mortgages on property acquired after the date of the applicable indenture, so long as these mortgages do not apply to any important property already owned by us or a restricted subsidiary other than any previously unimproved real property;  \\x95 existing mortgages on any property, shares of stock or indebtedness existing at the time of acquisition from a corporation merged with or into, or substantially all of the assets of which are acquired by, us or a restricted subsidiary;  \\x95 mortgages on property of any corporation existing at the time it becomes a restricted subsidiary;  \\x95 mortgages securing debt owed by a restricted subsidiary to us or to another restricted subsidiary;  \\x95 certain deposits or pledges of assets;  \\x95 mortgages in favor of governmental bodies to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments under any contract or statute or to secure indebtedness incurred to finance all or any part of the purchase price or cost of constructing or improving the property subject to these mortgages, including mortgages to secure tax exempt pollution control revenue bonds;  \\x95 mortgages on property acquired by us or a restricted subsidiary through the exercise of rights arising out of defaults on receivables acquired in the ordinary course of business;  \\x95 judgment liens so long as the finality of such judgment is being contested in good faith and execution thereon is stayed;   \\x95 extensions, renewals or replacements of the foregoing, subject to certain limitations;  \\x95 liens for taxes or assessments or governmental charges or levies not yet due or delinquent, or which can thereafter be paid without penalty, or which are being contested in good faith; landlord\\'s liens on leased property; and other similar liens which do not, in deere & company\\'s opinion, materially impair the use of that property in the operation of our business or the business of a restricted subsidiary or the value of that property for the purposes of that business;  \\x95 any sale of

term sheet, debt securities will be denominated in u.s. dollars, payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on debt securities will be made in u.s. dollars and payment of the purchase price of debt securities must be made in u.s. dollars in immediately available funds. if foreign currency notes are to be denominated or payable in a currency (a \"specified currency\") other than u.s. dollars, the following provisions will apply in addition to, and to the extent inconsistent therewith will replace, the description of general terms and provisions of debt securities set forth in this prospectus and elsewhere in the accompanying prospectus supplement or term sheet.           a prospectus supplement or term sheet with respect to any foreign currency note (which may include information with respect to applicable current foreign exchange controls) is a part of this prospectus. any information concerning exchange rates is furnished as a matter of information only and should not be regarded as indicative of the range of or trends in fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may occur in the future.         currencies            we may offer foreign currency notes denominated and/or payable in a specified currency or specified currencies. unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, purchasers are required to pay for foreign currency notes in the specified currency. at the present time, there are limited facilities in the united states for conversion of u.s. dollars into specified currencies and vice versa, and banks may elect not to offer non-u.s. dollar checking or savings account   42        table of contents  facilities in the united states. however, if requested on or prior to the fifth business day preceding the date of delivery of the foreign currency notes, or by such other day as determined by the agent or underwriter who presents such offer to purchase foreign currency notes to us, such agent or underwriter may be prepared to arrange for the conversion of u.s. dollars into the specified currency set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet to enable the purchasers to pay for the foreign currency notes. each such conversion will be made by the agents or underwriters on such terms and subject to such conditions, limitations and charges as the agents may from time to time establish in accordance with their regular foreign exchange practices. all costs of exchange will be borne by the purchasers of the foreign currency notes.           information about the specified currency in which a particular foreign currency note is denominated and/or payable, including historical exchange rates and a description of the currency and any exchange controls, will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet.         payment of principal and interest            the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on foreign currency notes is payable by us in the specified currency. currently, banks do not generally offer non-u.s. dollar-denominated account facilities in their offices in the united states, although they are permitted to do so. accordingly, a holder of foreign currency notes will be paid in u.s. dollars converted from the specified currency unless the holder is entitled to elect, and does elect, to be paid in the specified currency, or as otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet.           any u.s. dollar amount to be received by a holder of a foreign currency note will be based on the highest bid quotation in the city of new york received by an agent for us specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet (the \"exchange rate agent\") at approximately 11:00 a.m., new york city time, on the second business day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the exchange rate agent) selected by the exchange rate agent and approved by us for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the specified currency for u.s. dollars for settlement on the payment date in the aggregate amount of the specified currency payable to all holders of foreign currency notes scheduled to receive u.s. dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. if three bid quotations are not available, payments will be made in the specified currency. all currency exchange costs will be borne by the holder of the foreign currency note by deductions from such payments.           unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, a holder of foreign currency notes may elect to receive payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the foreign currency notes in the specified currency by transmitting a written request for such payment to the corporate trust office of the trustee in the city of new york on or prior to the regular record date or at least 15 calendar days prior to maturity date, as the case may be. this request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or sent by cable, telex, facsimile or other form of transmission. a holder of a foreign currency note may elect to receive payment in the specified currency for all principal, premium, if any, and interest payments and need not file a separate election for each payment. this election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the trustee, but written notice of any revocation must be received by the trustee on or prior to the regular record date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the maturity date, as the case may be. holders of foreign currency notes whose notes are to be held in the name of a broker or nominee should contact their brokers or nominees to determine whether and how an election to receive payments in the specified currency may be made.            unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, if the specified currency is other than u.s. dollars, a beneficial owner of the related global security who elects to receive payments of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in the specified currency must   43        table of contents  notify its participant through which it owns its beneficial interest on or prior to the applicable record date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the maturity date, as the case may be, of such beneficial owner\\'s election. the participant must notify the depositary of such election on or prior to the third business day after such record date or at least 12 calendar days prior to the maturity date, as the case may be, and the depositary will notify the trustee of such election on or prior to the fifth business day after such record date or at least 10 calendar days prior to the maturity date, as the case may be. if complete instructions are received by the participant from the beneficial owner and forwarded by the participant to the depositary, and by the depositary to the trustee, on or prior to such dates, then the beneficial owner will receive payments in the specified currency. see \"description of debt securities\\x97provisions applicable to both of the indentures\\x97global securities.\"           principal and interest on foreign currency notes paid in u.s. dollars will be paid in the manner specified in this prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement or term sheet with respect to debt securities denominated in u.s. dollars. see \"description of debt securities\\x97general.\" interest on foreign currency notes paid in the specified currency will be paid by check mailed on an interest payment date other than a maturity date to the persons entitled thereto at the addresses of such holders as they appear in the security register or, at our option, by wire transfer to a bank account maintained by the holder in the country of the specified currency. the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on foreign currency notes, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon, due on the maturity date will be paid, in the specified currency in immediately available funds upon surrender of such notes at the corporate trust office of the trustee in the city of new york, or, at our option, by wire transfer to such bank account of immediately available funds to an account with a bank designated at least 15 calendar days prior to the maturity date by the applicable registered holder, provided the particular bank has appropriate facilities to make these payments and the particular foreign currency note is presented and surrendered at the office or agency maintained by us for this purpose in the borough of manhattan, the city of new york, in time for the trustee to make these payments in accordance with its normal procedures.         payment currency            if a specified currency is not available for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to a foreign currency note due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control, we will be entitled to satisfy our obligations to holders of foreign currency notes by making such payment in u.s. dollars on the basis of the noon buying rate in the city of new york for cable transfers of the specified currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the federal reserve bank of new york (the \"market exchange rate\") as computed by the exchange rate agent on the second business day prior to such payment or, if not then available, on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate or as otherwise indicated in an applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet. any payment made under these circumstances in u.s. dollars where the required payment is in a specified currency will not constitute a default under the indenture with respect to that foreign currency note.           all determinations referred to above made by the exchange rate agent will be at its sole discretion and will, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the holders of the foreign currency notes.           as indicated above, an investment in foreign currency notes involves substantial risks, and the extent and nature of such risks change continuously. as with any investment in a security, prospective purchasers should consult their own financial and legal advisors as to the risks entailed in an investment in foreign currency notes. such notes are not an appropriate investment for prospective purchasers who are unsophisticated with respect to foreign currency matters.  44        table of contents        description of debt warrants                  we may issue (either separately or together with other offered securities) debt warrants to purchase underlying debt securities issued by us (\"offered debt warrants\"). we will issue the debt warrants under warrant agreements (each, a \"debt warrant agreement\") to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as warrant agent (the \"debt warrant agent\"), identified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.           because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the debt warrants and the debt warrant agreement. we urge you to read the debt warrant agreement because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of debt warrants. we have filed the form of debt warrant agreement as an exhibit to the registration statement that we have filed with the sec of which this prospectus forms a part. see \"where you can find more information\" for information on how to obtain a copy of the debt warrant agreement. in this section, the terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ourselves\" and \"us\" mean deere & company alone.         general            you should read the prospectus supplement or term sheet for the material terms of the offered debt warrants, including the following:    \\x95 the title and aggregate number of the debt warrants.  \\x95 the title, rank, aggregate principal amount and terms of the underlying debt securities purchasable upon exercise of the debt warrants.   \\x95 the principal amount of underlying debt securities that may be purchased upon exercise of each debt warrant, and the price or the manner of determining the price at which this principal amount may be purchased upon exercise.  \\x95 the time or times at which, or the period or periods during which, the debt warrants may be exercised and the expiration date of the debt warrants.  \\x95 any optional redemption terms.  \\x95 whether certificates evidencing the debt warrants will be issued in registered or bearer form and, if registered, where they may be transferred and exchanged.  \\x95 whether the debt warrants are to be issued with any debt securities or any other securities and, if so, the amount and terms of these debt securities or other securities.  \\x95 the date, if any, on and after which the debt warrants and these debt securities or other securities will be separately transferable.   \\x95 any other material terms of the debt warrants.            the prospectus supplement or term sheet will also contain a discussion of the united states federal income tax considerations relevant to the offering.           debt warrant certificates will be exchangeable for new debt warrant certificates of different authorized denominations. no service charge will be imposed for any permitted transfer or exchange of debt warrant certificates, but we may require payment of any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. debt warrants may be exercised and exchanged and debt warrants in registered form may be presented for registration of transfer at the corporate trust office of the debt warrant agent or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.   45        table of contents        exercise of debt warrants            each offered debt warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase the amount of underlying debt securities at the exercise price set forth in, or calculable from, the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to the offered debt warrants. after the close of business on the expiration date, unexercised debt warrants will be void.           debt warrants may be exercised by payment to the debt warrant agent of the applicable exercise price and by delivery to the debt warrant agent of the related debt warrant certificate, properly completed. debt warrants will be deemed to have been exercised upon receipt of the exercise price and the debt warrant certificate or certificates. upon receipt of this payment and the properly completed debt warrant certificates, we will, as soon as practicable, deliver the amount of underlying debt securities purchased upon exercise.            if fewer than all of the debt warrants represented by any debt warrant certificate are exercised, a new debt warrant certificate will be issued for the unexercised debt warrants. the holder of a debt warrant will be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issuance of underlying debt securities purchased upon exercise.         modifications            there are three types of changes we can make to a debt warrant agreement and the debt warrants issued thereunder.            changes requiring your approval.    first, there are changes that cannot be made to your debt warrants without your specific approval. those types of changes include modifications and amendments that:    \\x95 accelerate the expiration date;  \\x95 reduce the number of outstanding debt warrants, the consent of the holders of which is required for a modification or amendment; or   \\x95 otherwise materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of the debt warrants.             changes not requiring approval.    the second type of change does not require any vote by holders of the debt warrants. this type of change is limited to clarifications and other changes that would not materially adversely affect the interests of holders of the debt warrants.            changes requiring a majority vote.    any other change to the debt warrant agreement and the debt warrants requires a vote in favor by holders of not fewer than a majority in number of the then outstanding unexercised debt warrants affected thereby. most changes fall into this category.         no rights as holders of underlying debt securities            before the warrants are exercised, holders of the debt warrants are not entitled to payments of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the related underlying debt securities or to exercise any other rights whatsoever as holders of the underlying debt securities.         description of preferred stock                  under our restated certificate of incorporation (the \"certificate of incorporation\"), we are authorized to adopt resolutions providing for the issuance, in one or more series, of up to 9,000,000 shares of preferred stock, u.s. moneytoken  par value, with the powers, preferences and relative, participating,   46        table

section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of our preferred stock. we urge you to read our certificate of incorporation and the certificate of designations creating your preferred stock because they, and not this description, define your rights as a holder of preferred stock. we have filed our certificate of incorporation and will file the certificate of designations with the sec. see \"where you can find more information\" for information on how to obtain copies of these documents. in this section, the terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ourselves\" and \"us\" mean deere & company alone.           the additional specific terms of any preferred stock proposed to be sold under this prospectus (\"offered preferred stock\") will be described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. if so indicated in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, the terms of the offered preferred stock may differ from the terms set forth below.           as of the date of this prospectus, we have no outstanding preferred stock.          general            unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to the offered preferred stock, each series of preferred stock will rank on a parity as to dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation and in all other respects with all other series of preferred stock. the preferred stock will, when issued, be fully paid and nonassessable and holders thereof will have no preemptive rights.           you should read the prospectus supplement or term sheet for the material terms of the preferred stock offered thereby, including the following:    \\x95 the title and stated value of the preferred stock.  \\x95 the number of shares of the preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of the preferred stock.   \\x95 the dividend rate(s), period(s) and/or payment date(s) or method(s) of calculation thereof applicable to the preferred stock.   \\x95 the date from which

securities exchange.  \\x95 whether the preferred stock will be issued with any other securities and, if so, the amount and terms of these other securities.   \\x95 any other specific terms,

any then outstanding preferred stock, we may issue additional series of preferred stock, at any time or from time to time, with the powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as our board of directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, all without further action of our stockholders, including holders of our then outstanding preferred stock.            if applicable, the prospectus supplement or term sheet will also contain a discussion of the material united states federal income tax considerations relevant to the offering.         dividends            holders of preferred stock will be entitled to receive cash dividends, when, as and if declared by our board of directors, out of our assets legally available for payment, at the rate and on the dates set forth in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. each dividend will be payable to holders of record as they appear on our stock books on the record date fixed by our board of directors. dividends, if cumulative, will be cumulative from and after the date set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet.           we may not:    \\x95 declare or pay dividends (except in our stock that is junior as to dividends and liquidation rights to the preferred stock (\"junior stock\")) or make any other distributions on junior stock, or  \\x95 purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire junior stock or set aside funds for that purpose (except in a reclassification or exchange of junior stock through the issuance of other junior stock or with the proceeds of a reasonably contemporaneous sale of junior stock),    if there are arrearages in dividends or failure in the payment of our sinking fund or redemption obligations on any of our preferred stock and, in the case of the first bullet point above, if dividends in full for the current quarterly dividend period have not been paid or declared on any of our preferred stock.           dividends in full may not be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any series of preferred stock unless:    \\x95 there are no arrearages in dividends for any past dividend periods on any series of preferred stock, and   \\x95 to the extent that the dividends are cumulative, dividends in full for the current dividend period have been declared or paid on all preferred stock.            any dividends declared or paid when dividends are not so declared, paid or set apart in full will be shared ratably by the holders of all series of preferred stock in proportion to the respective arrearages and undeclared and unpaid current cumulative dividends. no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, will be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments that may be in arrears.         conversion and exchange            if the preferred stock will be convertible into or exchangeable for other shares of our stock or other securities, the prospectus supplement or term sheet will set forth the terms and conditions of that conversion or exchange, including the conversion price or exchange ratio (or the method of calculating the same), the conversion or exchange period (or the method of determining the same), whether conversion or exchange will be mandatory or at the option of the holder or us, the events requiring an adjustment of the conversion price or the exchange ratio and provisions affecting conversion or exchange in the event of the redemption of that preferred stock. these terms may also include   48        table of contents  provisions under which the number of other shares of our stock or the number or amount of other securities to be received by the holders of that preferred stock upon conversion or exchange would be calculated according to the market price of such other shares of our stock or those other securities as of a time stated in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.         liquidation rights            in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of each series of our preferred stock will be entitled to receive out of our assets that are available for distribution to stockholders, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of any junior stock, liquidating distributions in the amount set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. if, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the amounts payable with respect to the preferred stock are not paid in full, the holders of our preferred stock of each series will share ratably in the distribution of our assets in proportion to the full respective preferential amounts to which they are entitled. after payment of the full amount of the liquidating distribution to which they are entitled, the holders of our preferred stock will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of our assets. our consolidation or merger with or into any other corporation or corporations or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets will not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us for purposes of these provisions.          redemption            if so provided in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, the offered preferred stock may be redeemable in whole or in part at our option at the times and at the redemption prices set forth therein.           if dividends on any series of preferred stock are in arrears or we have failed to fulfill our sinking fund or redemption obligations with respect to any series of preferred stock, we may not purchase or redeem shares of preferred stock or any other capital stock ranking on a parity with the preferred stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor permit any subsidiary to do so, without in either case the consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of preferred stock then outstanding; provided, however, that:    \\x95 to meet our purchase, retirement or sinking fund obligations with respect to any series of preferred stock, we may use shares of that preferred stock acquired prior to the arrearages or failure of payment and then held as treasury stock, and  \\x95 we may complete the purchase or redemption of shares of preferred stock for which a contract was entered into for any purchase, retirement or sinking fund purposes prior to the arrearages or failure of payment.          voting rights            except as indicated below or in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, or except as expressly required by applicable law, the holders of the preferred stock will not be entitled to vote. as used herein, the term \"applicable preferred stock\" means those series of preferred stock to which the provisions described herein are expressly made applicable by resolutions of our board of directors.           if the equivalent of six quarterly dividends payable on any shares of any series of applicable preferred stock are in default (whether or not the dividends have been declared or the defaulted dividends are consecutive), the number of our directors will be increased by two and the holders of all outstanding series of applicable preferred stock (whether or not dividends thereon are in default), voting as a single class without regard to series, will be entitled to elect the two additional directors until four consecutive quarterly dividends are paid or declared and set apart for payment, if the shares   49        table of contents  are non-cumulative, or until all arrearages in dividends and dividends in full for the current quarterly period are paid or declared and set apart for payment, if the shares are cumulative, whereupon all voting rights described herein will be divested from the applicable preferred stock. the holders of applicable preferred stock may exercise their special class voting rights at meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors or at special meetings for the purpose of electing directors, in either case at which the holders of not less than one-third of the aggregate number of shares of applicable preferred stock are present in person or by proxy.            the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of any series of preferred stock will be required:    \\x95 for any amendment of our certificate of incorporation (or the related certificate of designations) that will adversely affect the powers, preferences or rights of the holders of the preferred stock of that series, or  \\x95 to create any class of stock (or increase the authorized number of shares of any class of stock) that will have preference as to dividends or upon liquidation over the preferred stock of that series or create any stock or other security convertible into or exchangeable for or evidencing the right to purchase any stock of that class.            in addition, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the then outstanding shares of our preferred stock will be required to:    \\x95 increase the authorized amount of our preferred stock, or  \\x95 unless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet, create any class of stock (or increase the authorized number of shares of any class of stock) that will rank on a parity with the preferred stock either as to dividends or upon liquidation, or create any stock or other security convertible into or exchangeable for or evidencing the right to purchase any stock of that class.         description of depositary shares                  we may offer (either separately or together with other offered securities) depositary shares representing interests in shares of our preferred stock of one or more series. the depositary shares will be issued under deposit agreements (each, a \"deposit agreement\") to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as depositary (the \"preferred stock depositary\"), identified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.           because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the depositary shares and deposit agreement. we urge you to read the deposit agreement because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of depositary shares. we have filed the form of deposit agreement, including the form of depositary receipts evidencing depositary shares (the \"depositary receipts\"), as an exhibit to the registration statement that we have filed with the sec, of which this prospectus forms a part. see \"where you can find more information\" for information on how to obtain a copy of the deposit agreement. in this section, the terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ourselves\" and \"us\" mean deere & company alone.           the specific terms of any depositary shares proposed to be sold under this prospectus will be described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. if so indicated in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, the terms of the depositary shares may differ from the terms set forth below.         general            we may provide for the issuance by the preferred stock depositary to the public of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares, each of which will represent a fractional interest (to be   50        table of contents  specified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet) in one share of the related preferred stock, as described below.           you should read the prospectus supplement or term sheet for the material terms of the depositary shares offered thereby, including the following:    \\x95 the number of depositary shares and the fraction of one share of preferred stock represented by one depositary share.   \\x95 the terms of the series of preferred stock deposited by us under the deposit agreement.  \\x95 whether the depositary shares will be listed on any securities exchange.  \\x95 whether the depositary shares will be sold with any other offered securities and, if so, the amount and terms of these other securities.   \\x95 any other terms of the depositary shares.            if applicable, the prospectus supplement or term sheet will also contain a discussion of the united states federal income tax considerations relevant to the offering.            depositary receipts will be exchangeable for new depositary receipts of different denominations. we will not impose a service charge for any permitted transfer or exchange of depositary receipts, but we may require payment of any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each owner of a depositary share will be entitled, in proportion to the applicable fractional interest in a share of preferred stock of the series represented by the depositary share, to all rights and preferences of the preferred stock represented by the depositary share, including dividend, voting and liquidation rights and any redemption, conversion or exchange rights.          dividends and other distributions            the preferred stock depositary will distribute all cash dividends and other cash distributions received in respect of the related series of preferred stock to the record holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the number of the depositary shares owned by the holders on the relevant record date. the preferred stock depositary will distribute only the amount, however, as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of depositary shares a fraction of one cent, and any balance not so distributed will be added to and treated as part of the next sum, if any, received by the preferred stock depositary for distribution to record holders of depositary shares.            in the event of a distribution other than in cash, the preferred stock depositary will distribute property received by it to the record holders of depositary shares entitled thereto, unless the preferred stock depositary determines that it is not feasible to make the distribution, in which case the preferred stock depositary may, with our approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders.           the deposit agreement will also contain provisions relating to the manner in which any subscription or similar rights offered by us to holders of the related series of preferred stock will be made available to holders of depositary shares.         withdrawal of preferred stock            upon surrender of depositary receipts at the corporate trust office of the preferred stock depositary (unless the related shares of preferred stock have previously been called for redemption), the holder of the depositary shares evidenced thereby will be entitled to receive at that office, to or upon the holder\\'s order, the number of whole shares of the related series of preferred stock and any money or other property represented by the depositary shares. shares of preferred stock so withdrawn,   51        table of contents  however, may not be redeposited. if the holder requests withdrawal of less than all the shares of preferred stock to which the holder is entitled, or if the holder would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of preferred stock, the preferred stock depositary will deliver to the holder a new depositary receipt evidencing the balance or fractional share.          redemption of depositary shares            whenever we redeem preferred stock held by the preferred stock depositary, the preferred stock depositary will redeem as of the same redemption date the number of depositary shares representing the preferred stock so redeemed; provided that we have paid in full to the preferred stock depositary the redemption price of the preferred stock plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption. the redemption price per depositary share will be equal to the applicable fraction of the redemption price per share and accrued and unpaid dividends payable with respect to the preferred stock. if less than all the depositary shares are to be redeemed, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by lot or pro rata or by another equitable method, in each case as may be determined by us.           after the date fixed for redemption, the depositary shares so called for redemption will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of the depositary shares will cease, except the right to receive the moneys payable upon the redemption and any money or other property to which the holders of the depositary shares were entitled upon the redemption and surrender to the preferred stock depositary of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares.          conversion and exchange            depositary shares are not convertible into or exchangeable for other shares of our stock or other securities. nevertheless, if the preferred stock represented by depositary shares is convertible into or exchangeable for other shares of our stock or other securities, the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares may be surrendered by the holder thereof to the preferred stock depositary with written instructions to convert or exchange the preferred stock into whole shares of our other stock or other securities, as specified in the related prospectus supplement or term sheet. upon receipt of these instructions and any amounts payable in respect thereof, we will cause the conversion or exchange thereof and will deliver to the holder whole shares of our other stock or the whole number of other securities (and cash in lieu of any fractional share or security). in the case of a partial conversion or exchange, the holder will receive a new depositary receipt evidencing the unconverted or unexchanged balance.         voting the preferred stock            upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of one or more series of preferred stock are entitled to vote, the preferred stock depositary will mail the information contained in the notice of meeting to the holders of the depositary shares relating to the preferred stock. each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date for the meeting will be entitled to instruct the preferred stock depositary as to the manner in which to vote the number of shares of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares. we will agree to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the preferred stock depositary in order to enable the preferred stock depositary to vote in accordance with each holder\\'s instructions. the preferred stock depositary will abstain from voting preferred stock to the extent it does not receive instructions from the holders of depositary shares representing the preferred stock.   52        table of contents        amendment and termination of the deposit agreement            the form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares and any provision of the deposit agreement may at any time be amended by agreement between the preferred stock depositary and us. however, any amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary shares will not be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the holders of at least a majority of the depositary shares then outstanding (or any greater amount as may be required by the rules of any exchange on which the depositary shares are listed); provided that any amendment that prejudices any substantial right of the holders of depositary shares will not become effective until the expiration of 90 days after notice of the amendment has been given to the holders. a holder that continues to hold one or more depositary receipts at the expiration of the 90-day period will be deemed to consent to, and will be bound by, the amendment. no amendment may impair the right of any holder to surrender the holder\\'s depositary receipt and receive the related preferred stock, as discussed above under \"withdrawal of preferred stock.\"           we may terminate the deposit agreement at any time upon not less than 60 days\\' prior written notice to the preferred stock depositary. in that case, the preferred stock depositary will deliver to each holder of depositary shares, upon surrender of the related depositary receipts, the number of whole shares of the related series of preferred stock to which the holder is entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share.           the deposit agreement will terminate automatically after all the related preferred stock has been redeemed, withdrawn, converted or exchanged or there has been a final distribution in respect of the preferred stock represented by the depositary shares in connection with our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.         charges of preferred stock depositary            except as provided in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, we will pay the fees and expenses of the preferred stock depositary, and the holders of depositary receipts will be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with the transfer, exercise, surrender or split-up of depositary receipts.          miscellaneous            the preferred stock depositary will forward to the holders of depositary shares all reports and communications from us that are delivered to the preferred stock depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the preferred stock. neither the preferred stock depositary nor we will be liable if prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond the preferred stock depositary\\'s or our control in performing the preferred stock depositary\\'s or our respective obligations under the deposit agreement. the obligations of the preferred stock depositary and us under the deposit agreement will be limited to performance in good faith and without gross negligence of the preferred stock depositary\\'s or our respective duties thereunder, and neither the preferred stock depositary nor we will be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding in respect of any depositary shares or related shares of preferred stock unless satisfactory indemnity is furnished.         resignation and removal of preferred stock depositary            the preferred stock depositary may resign at any time by delivering to us notice of its election to do so, and we may at any time remove the preferred stock depositary, the resignation or removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor preferred stock depositary. the successor preferred stock depositary must be appointed within 60 days after delivery of a notice of resignation or removal and must be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the united states and having a combined capital and surplus of at least u.s. moneytoken    53                                                table of contents         description of common stock                  deere & company may issue (either separately or together with other offered securities) shares of its common stock. under our restated certificate of incorporation we are authorized to issue up to 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock. you should read the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to an offering of common stock, or of securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for common stock, for the material terms of the offering, including the number of shares of common stock offered, any initial offering price and market prices and dividend information relating to deere & company common stock. see \"description of outstanding capital stock\" below.         description of common warrants                  we may issue (either separately or together with other offered securities) warrants to purchase common stock of deere & company (\"offered common warrants\"). we will issue the common warrants under warrant agreements (each, a \"common warrant agreement\") to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as warrant agent (the \"common warrant agent\"), identified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.           because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the common warrants and common warrant agreement. we urge you to read the common warrant agreement because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of common warrants. we have filed the form of common warrant agreement as an exhibit to the registration statement that we have filed with the sec, of which this prospectus forms a part. see \"where you can find more information\" for information on how to obtain a copy of the common warrant agreement. in this section, the terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ourselves\" and \"us\" mean deere & company alone.         general            you should read the prospectus supplement or term sheet for the material terms of the offered common warrants, including the following:    \\x95 the title and aggregate number of the common warrants.  \\x95 the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased upon exercise of each common warrant; the price, or the manner of determining the price, at which the shares may be purchased upon exercise; if other than cash, the property and manner in which the exercise price may be paid; and any minimum number of common warrants that must be exercised at any one time.  \\x95 the time or times at which, or period or periods in which, the common warrants may be exercised and the expiration date of the common warrants.   \\x95 any optional redemption terms.  \\x95 the terms of any right that we may have to accelerate the exercise of the common warrants upon the occurrence of certain events.   \\x95 whether the common warrants will be sold with any other offered securities and, if so, the amount and terms of these other securities.   \\x95 the date, if any, on and after which the common warrants and any other offered securities will be separately transferable.   \\x95 any other terms of the common warrants.            the prospectus supplement or term sheet will also contain a discussion of the united states federal income tax considerations relevant to the offering.   54        table of contents          certificates representing common warrants will be exchangeable for new common warrant certificates of different authorized denominations. we will not impose a service charge for any permitted transfer or exchange of common warrant certificates, but we may require payment of any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. common warrants may be exercised at the corporate trust office of the common warrant agent or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.         exercise of common warrants            each offered common warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase the number of shares of our common stock at the exercise price set forth in, or calculable from, the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to the offered common warrants. after the close of business on the applicable expiration date, unexercised common warrants will be void.           offered common warrants may be exercised by payment to the common warrant agent of the exercise price and by delivery to the common warrant agent of the related common warrant certificate, with the reverse side thereof properly completed. offered common warrants will be deemed to have been exercised upon receipt of the exercise price and the common warrant certificate or certificates. upon receipt of the payment and the properly completed common warrant certificates, we will, as soon as practicable, deliver the shares of common stock purchased upon the exercise.           if fewer than all of the offered common warrants represented by any common warrant certificate are exercised, a new common warrant certificate will be issued for the unexercised offered common warrants. the holder of an offered common warrant will be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issuance of common stock purchased upon exercise.         modifications            there are three types of changes we can make to a common warrant agreement and the common warrants issued thereunder.            changes requiring your approval.    first, there are changes that cannot be made to your common warrants without your specific approval. those types of changes include modifications and amendments that:    \\x95 accelerate the expiration date;  \\x95 reduce the number of outstanding common warrants, the consent of the holders of which is required for a modification or amendment; or   \\x95 otherwise materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of the common warrants.             changes not requiring approval.    the second type of change does not require any vote by holders of the common warrants. this type of change is limited to clarifications and other changes that would not materially adversely affect the interests of the holders of the common warrants.            changes requiring a majority vote.    any other change to the common warrant agreement requires a vote in favor by holders of not fewer than a majority in number of the then outstanding unexercised common warrants affected thereby. most changes fall into this category.         common warrant adjustments            the terms and conditions on which the exercise price of and/or the number of shares of common stock covered by a common warrant are subject to adjustment will be set forth in the common warrant agreement and the prospectus supplement or term sheet. the terms will include provisions for   55        table of contents  adjusting the exercise price and/or the number of shares of common stock covered by the common warrant; the events requiring the adjustment; the events upon which we may, in lieu of making the adjustment, make proper provisions so that the holder of a common warrant, upon exercise thereof, would be treated as if the holder had exercised the common warrant prior to the occurrence of the events; and provisions affecting exercise in the event of certain events affecting the common stock.         no rights as stockholders            holders of common warrants are not entitled, by virtue of being holders, to receive dividends or to vote, consent or receive notice as our stockholders in respect of any meeting of stockholders for the election of our directors or for any other matter, or exercise any other rights whatsoever as our stockholders.         description of currency warrants                  we may issue (either separately or together with other offered securities) currency warrants (the \"offered currency warrants\"). we may issue the offered currency warrants:    \\x95 in the form of currency put warrants, entitling the owners thereof to receive from us the cash settlement value in u.s. dollars of the right to purchase a designated amount of u.s. dollars for a designated amount of a specified foreign currency (a \"base currency\");  \\x95 in the form of currency call warrants, entitling the owners thereof to receive from us the cash settlement value in u.s. dollars of the right to sell a designated amount of u.s. dollars for a designated amount of a base currency; or  \\x95 in another form as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet.            a currency warrant will not require or entitle the owners to sell, deliver, purchase or take delivery of any base currency. the currency warrants will be issued under warrant agreements (each, a \"currency warrant agreement\") to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as warrant agent (the \"currency warrant agent\"), identified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.           because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the currency warrants and currency warrant agreement. we urge you to read the currency warrant agreement because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of currency warrants. we have filed the form of currency warrant agreement as an exhibit to the registration statement that we filed with the sec, of which this prospectus forms a part. see \"where you can find more information\" for information on how to obtain a copy of the currency warrant agreement. in this section, the terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ourselves\" and \"us\" mean deere & company alone.         general            you should read the prospectus supplement or term sheet for the material terms of the offered currency warrants, including the following:    \\x95 the title and aggregate number of the currency warrants.  \\x95 the material risk factors relating to the currency warrants.  \\x95 whether the currency warrants will be currency put warrants, currency call warrants, both puts and calls or otherwise.   \\x95 the formula for determining the cash settlement value, if applicable, of each currency warrant.  \\x95 the procedures and conditions relating to the exercise of the currency warrants.   56        table of contents    \\x95 the date on which the right to exercise the currency warrants will commence and the date (the \"currency warrant expiration date\") on which this right will expire.  \\x95 the circumstances, in addition to their automatic exercise upon the currency warrant expiration date, that will cause the currency warrants to be deemed to be automatically exercised.  \\x95 any minimum number, of the currency warrants that must be exercised at any one time, other than upon automatic exercise.   \\x95 whether the currency warrants are to be issued with any other offered securities and, if so, the amount and terms of these other securities.   \\x95 any other terms of the currency warrants.            the prospectus supplement or term sheet will also contain a discussion of the federal income tax considerations relevant to the offering.           if currency warrants are to be offered either in the form of currency put warrants or currency call warrants, an owner will receive a cash payment upon exercise only if the currency warrants have a cash settlement value in excess of zero at that time. the spot exchange rate of the applicable base currency, as compared to the u.s. dollar, will determine whether the currency warrants have a cash settlement value on any given day prior to their expiration. the currency warrants are expected to be \"out-of-the-money\" (i.e., the cash settlement value will be zero) when initially sold and will be \"in-the-money\" (i.e., their cash settlement value will exceed zero) if, in the case of currency put warrants, the base currency depreciates against the u.s. dollar to the extent that one u.s. dollar is worth more than the price determined for the base currency in the prospectus supplement or term sheet (the \"strike price\") or, in the case of currency call warrants, the base currency appreciates against the u.s. dollar to the extent one u.s. dollar is worth less than the strike price.            \"cash settlement value\" on an exercise date (as this term will be defined in the prospectus supplement or term sheet) is an amount that is the greater of:    \\x95 zero, and  \\x95 the amount computed, in the case of currency put warrants, by subtracting from a constant or, in the case of currency call warrants, by subtracting the constant from, an amount equal to the constant multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the strike price and the denominator of which is the spot exchange rate of the base currency for u.s. dollars on the exercise date (the \"spot rate\"), as the spot rate is determined pursuant to the currency warrant agreement.    information concerning the historical exchange rates for the base currency will be included in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.           there will be a time lag between the time that an owner of currency warrants gives instructions to exercise the currency warrants and the time that the spot rate relating to the exercise is determined, as described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.           currency warrants will be our unsecured contractual obligations and will rank on a parity with our other unsecured contractual obligations and with our unsecured and unsubordinated debt.         book-entry procedures and settlement            unless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, each issue of currency warrants will be issued in book-entry only form and represented by a single global currency warrant certificate, registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee. owners will generally not be entitled to receive definitive certificates representing currency warrants. an owner\\'s ownership of a currency warrant will be recorded on or through the records of the bank, broker or other financial institution   57        table of contents  that maintains the owner\\'s account. in turn, the total number of currency warrants held by an individual bank, broker or other financial institution for its clients will be maintained on the records of the depositary. transfer of ownership of any currency warrant will be effected only through the selling owner\\'s brokerage firm. neither the currency warrant agent nor we will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to beneficial ownership interests of global currency warrant certificates or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing records relating to the beneficial ownership interests.           the cash settlement value on exercise of a currency warrant will be paid by the currency warrant agent to the appropriate depositary participant. each participant will be responsible for disbursing the payments to the beneficial owners of the currency warrants that it represents and to each bank, broker or other financial institution for which it acts as agent. each bank, broker or other financial institution will be responsible for disbursing funds to the beneficial owners of the currency warrants that it represents.            if the depositary is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 90 days, we will issue currency warrants in definitive form, in exchange for the global currency warrant. in addition, we may at any time determine not to have the currency warrants represented by a global currency warrant and, in that event, will issue currency warrants in definitive form, in exchange for the global currency warrant. in either instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in the global currency warrant will be entitled to have a number of currency warrants equivalent to the beneficial interest registered in its name and will be entitled to physical delivery of the currency warrants in definitive form.          exercise of currency warrants            unless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, each currency warrant will entitle the owner to the cash settlement value of the currency warrant on the applicable exercise date. if not exercised prior to a specified time on the fifth business day preceding the currency warrant expiration date, currency warrants will be automatically exercised on the currency warrant expiration date.          listing            each issue of currency warrants will be listed on a national securities exchange, subject only to official notice of issuance, as a pre-condition to the sale of any currency warrants, unless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. in the event that the currency warrants are delisted from, or permanently suspended from trading on, the exchange, currency warrants not previously exercised will be automatically exercised on the date the delisting or permanent trading suspension becomes effective. the applicable currency warrant agreement will contain a covenant by us not to seek delisting of the currency warrants from, or permanent suspension of their trading on, the applicable exchange.         modifications            the currency warrant agent and we may modify or amend a currency warrant agreement and the terms of the currency warrants issued thereunder with the consent of the beneficial owners of not less than a majority in number of the then outstanding unexercised currency warrants affected thereby, provided that no modification or amendment that decreases the strike price in the case of a currency put warrant, increases the strike price in the case of a currency call warrant, shortens the period of time during which the currency warrants may be exercised or otherwise materially and adversely affects the exercise rights of the beneficial owners of the currency warrants or reduces the number of outstanding currency warrants the consent of whose beneficial owners is required for modification or   58        table of contents  amendment of the currency warrant agreement or the terms of the currency warrants, may be made without the consent of each beneficial owner affected thereby.            a currency warrant agreement and the terms of the currency warrants issued thereunder may also be amended by the currency warrant agent and us, without the consent of the registered holders or beneficial owners, for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, or of curing, correcting or supplementing any defective or inconsistent provision contained therein, or in any other manner that we may deem necessary or desirable and that will not materially and adversely affect the interests of the beneficial owners.         enforceability of rights by holders; governing law            the currency warrant agent will act solely as our agent in connection with the issuance and exercise of currency warrants and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust for or with any owner of a beneficial interest in currency warrants or with the registered holder thereof. the currency warrant agent will have no duty or responsibility in case of any default by us in the performance of our obligations under the currency warrant agreement or a currency warrant certificate, including any duty or responsibility to initiate any proceedings at law or otherwise or to make any demand upon us. beneficial owners may, without the consent of the currency warrant agent, enforce by appropriate legal action, on their own behalf, their right to exercise, and to receive payment for, their currency warrants. except as may otherwise be provided in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, each issue of currency warrants and the applicable currency warrant agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of new york.         description of indexed warrants and other warrants                  we may issue (either separately or together with other offered securities) shelf warrants (the \"offered shelf warrants\"). subject to compliance with applicable law, the offered shelf warrants may be issued for the purchase or sale of debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the united states or units of a stock index or stock basket (collectively, \"exercise items\"). shelf warrants will be settled either through physical delivery or through payment of a cash settlement value as set forth in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. the shelf warrants will be issued under warrant agreements (each, a \"shelf warrant agreement\") to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as warrant agent (the \"shelf warrant agent\"), identified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.           because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the shelf warrants and shelf warrant agreement. we urge you to read the shelf warrant agreement because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of shelf warrants. we have filed the form of shelf warrant agreement as an exhibit to the registration statement that we filed with the sec, of which this prospectus forms a part. see \"where you can find more information\" for information on how to obtain a copy of the shelf warrant agreement. in this section, the terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ourselves\" and \"us\" mean deere & company alone.         general            you should read the prospectus supplement or term sheet for the material terms of the offered shelf warrants, including the following:    \\x95 the title and aggregate number of the shelf warrants.  \\x95 the material risk factors relating to the shelf warrants.  \\x95 the exercise items that the shelf warrants represent the right to buy or sell.  \\x95 the procedures and conditions relating to the exercise of the shelf warrants.   59        table of contents    \\x95 the date on which the right to exercise the shelf warrants will commence and the date on which this right will expire.   \\x95 the national securities exchange on which the shelf warrants will be listed, if any.  \\x95 any other material terms of the shelf warrants.            the prospectus supplement or term sheet will also set forth information concerning any other securities offered thereby and will contain a discussion of the united states federal income tax considerations relevant to the offering.           if the shelf warrants relate to the purchase or sale of debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the united states, it is currently expected that the shelf warrants will be listed on a national securities exchange. the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to the shelf warrants will describe the amount and designation of the debt securities covered by each shelf warrant, whether the shelf warrants provide for cash settlement or delivery of the shelf warrants upon exercise and the national securities exchange, if any, on which the shelf warrants will be listed.           if the shelf warrants relate to the purchase or sale of a unit of a stock index or a stock basket, the shelf warrants will provide for payment of an amount in cash determined by reference to increases or decreases in the stock index or stock basket. it is currently expected that these shelf warrants will be listed on a national securities exchange. the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to the shelf warrants will describe the terms of the shelf warrants, the stock index or stock basket covered by the

\\x95 may be exercised at the corporate trust office of the shelf warrant agent or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.            shelf warrants may be issued in the form of a single global shelf warrant certificate registered in the name of the nominee of the depositary of the shelf warrants, or may initially be issued in the form of definitive certificates that may be exchanged, on a fixed date, or on a date or dates selected by us, for an interest in a global shelf warrant certificate, as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement or term sheet. prior to the exercise of their shelf warrants, holders thereof will not have any rights under the warrants:    \\x95 to purchase or sell any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the united states or to receive any settlement value therefor; or   \\x95 to receive any settlement value in respect to any unit of a stock index or stock basket.          exercise of shelf warrants            each offered shelf warrant will entitle the holder to purchase or sell such amount of debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the united states at the exercise price, or receive the settlement value in respect of a stock index or stock basket, as shall in each case be set forth in, or calculable from, the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to the shelf warrants or as otherwise set forth in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. shelf warrants may be exercised at any time on the dates set forth in the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to the shelf warrants or as may be otherwise set forth in the prospectus supplement or term sheet. unless otherwise provided in the applicable   60        table of contents  prospectus supplement or term sheet, after the close of business on the applicable expiration date (as that date may be extended by us), unexercised shelf warrants will be void.           unless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement or term sheet, offered shelf warrants may be exercised by delivery of a properly completed shelf warrant certificate to the shelf warrant agent and, if required and if the shelf warrant does not provide for cash settlement, payment of the amount required to purchase the exercise items purchasable upon exercise. shelf warrants will be deemed to have been exercised upon receipt of the shelf warrant certificate and any payment, if applicable, at the corporate trust office of the shelf warrant agent or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement or term sheet and we will, as soon as practicable thereafter, buy or sell the debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the united states or pay the settlement value therefor. if fewer than all of the shelf warrants represented by the shelf warrant certificate are exercised, a new shelf warrant certificate will be issued for the remaining shelf warrants. the holder of an offered shelf warrant will be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed.         modifications            the shelf warrant agent and we may modify or amend a shelf warrant agreement and the terms of the shelf warrants issued thereunder with the consent of the owners of not less than a majority in number of the then outstanding unexercised shelf warrants affected thereby, provided that no modification or amendment that decreases the exercise price in the case of put warrants, increases the exercise price in the case of call warrants, shortens the period of time during which the shelf warrants may be exercised or otherwise materially and adversely affects the exercise rights of the holders of the shelf warrants or reduces the number of outstanding shelf warrants the consent of whose owners is required for modification or amendment of the shelf warrant agreement or the terms of the shelf warrants, may be made without the consent of each owner affected thereby.            a shelf warrant agreement and the terms of the shelf warrants issued thereunder may also be amended by the shelf warrant agent and us, without the consent of the holders or the owners, for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, or of curing, correcting or supplementing any defective or inconsistent provision contained therein, for the purpose of appointing a successor depositary, for the purpose of issuing shelf warrants in definitive form, or in any other manner that we may deem necessary or desirable and that will not materially and adversely affect the interests of the owners.         risk factors relating to the shelf warrants            the shelf warrants may entail significant risks, including, without limitation, the possibility of significant fluctuations in the market for the applicable exercise item, potential illiquidity in the secondary market and the risk that they will expire worthless. these risks will vary depending on the particular terms of the shelf warrants and will be more fully described in the prospectus supplement or term sheet.         description of outstanding capital stock                  deere & company\\'s authorized capital stock consists of (i) 1,200,000,000
